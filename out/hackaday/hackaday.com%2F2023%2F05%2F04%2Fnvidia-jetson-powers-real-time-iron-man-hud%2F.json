But lets be real, all that stuff is way too hard to try and pull off. Plus youll probably just end up accidentally killing yourself in the backyard.\nBut judging by the videos hes been posting, [Kris Kersey] is doing one hell of a job creating a functional heads-up display (HUD) similar to the one Tony uses in the films. Hes even building it into a 3D printed Iron Man helmet, with the NVIDIA Jetson board thats powering the show inside a chest-mounted Arc Reactor. He goes into a bit more detail about the project and his goals in an interview recently published on NVIDIAs own blog.\nDual 2K 120 Hz displays provide sharp visuals\nThe HUD shows [Kris] an impressive amount of information, such as his current compass heading, GPS position on a moving map, the tilt angle of his head, and various internal and external temperatures. Perhaps most impressively, it uses the computational power of the Jetson Nano to perform real-time object detection that highlights individuals as they come into his field of view. While that last function doesnt appear to have a practical application, seeing the HUD rapidly rendering a targeting reticle over each person certainly\u00a0looks like something out of a sci-fi film.\nIn the first video below, [Kris] takes the viewer through the process of building and testing the HUD system, which includes plenty of footage recorded through the helmets digital eyes. In the second video, he provides an update on the HUDs performance when he switches out the original NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board for the newer NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano  which we took a look at back when it released back in March.\nThis isnt actually the first time weve seen somebody create their own Iron Man helmet with a digital HUD. But with all due respect to those previous attempts, what [Kris] has accomplished here doesnt just raise the bar  it launches it into orbit.\n\n"}

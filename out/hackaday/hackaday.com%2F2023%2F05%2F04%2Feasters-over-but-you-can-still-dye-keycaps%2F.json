And once found, the set is often either prohibitively expensive, or it doesnt come in the desired layout, or both. So, why not color your own keycaps?\nThats exactly what [amphiboi] did, while standing on the shoulders of [CrowningKnight]s imgur post on the subject. Essentially, you use Rit dye and PBT keycaps for best results. Rit has a comprehensive guide to mixing their dyes to achieve pretty much whatever colors you want. Once thats all squared away, its time to gather your cooking supplies.\nStarting with a pot you dont care about and four cups of boiling water. Add about a teaspoon of dish soap, which helps the dye settle evenly across the keycaps. Then you just add the dye(s) and stir with an expendable spoon, then add your keycaps. 5-10 minutes later, depending on your desired outcome, the caps are ready to be rinsed, dried, and pushed on to your switches.\nSatisfied with the color of your keycaps, but wish they had cool legends?

The most detailed analysis so far seems to be by [Andres Freund] on the oss-security list.\nThe xz release tarballs from 5.6.0 in late February and 5.6.1 on March 9th both contain malicious code. A pair of compressed files in the repository contain the majority of the malicious patch, disguised as test files. In practice, this means that looking at the repository doesnt reveal anything amiss, but downloading the release tarballs gives you the compromised code.\nThis was discovered because SSH logins on a Debian sid were taking longer, with more CPU cycles than expected. And interestingly, Valgrind was throwing unexpected errors when running on the liblzma library. That last bit was first discovered on February 24th, immediately after the 5.6.0 release. The xz-utils package failed its tests on Gentoo builds.\n\n\nOne of the xz maintainers, [Jia Tan], weighed in on that Gentoo bug, suggesting that it was a GCC bug causing the Valgrind errors. This is the same developer that pushed the malicious archive files and minted the tainted releases. And as if to clear up any remaining doubts, the developer doubled down in a GitHub commit, working around the Valgrind errors, and linking to a completely unrelated GCC bug report claiming it to be this issue.\nAt this point, the only reasonable conclusion is that the person in control of the [JiaT75] GitHub account is a malicious actor and is completely untrustworthy. Whats unclear is if this is still the same developer that has been co-maintaining the project since August 2022. Its possible that [Jia Tan] has always been a bad actor, or that account may be completely compromised.\nWhat About SSH?\nWhat may not be clear is the connection to SSH. And its a trip. Many Linux distros patch sshd to add systemd features, and libsystemd pulls the liblzma library. That means the liblzma initialization code gets run when sshd starts. In the malicious code, the library checks argv[0], which is the name of the program being executed, for /usr/bin/sshd. Additionally it seems to check for debugging tools like rr and gdb. If the checks are green, liblzma replaces a few function calls with its own code. Its a complicated dance, but the exploit is specifically looking to replace RSA_public_decrypt.\nThats a very interesting function to clobber, as it is one of the functions used to validate SSH keys. Its not hard to imagine how malicious code here could check for a magic signature, and bypass the normal login process. The full analysis is still being done, and expect more information in the coming days.\nBut the bottom line is that a machine with a patched sshd binary, that also has xz packages version 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, is vulnerable to unauthenticated SSH logins. The good news is that only a few distributions have shipped the 5.6.x series of xz packages. Fedora Rawhide/41 them, and Debian Testing and Unstable shipped these versions as well. If youre on an affected system, look for an update right away.\nIts unclear what the path forwards is for the xz project. This is obviously an important system utility for Linux systems, and its current maintainers seem to be asleep at the wheel  or intentionally steering towards disaster. Expect one or more hard forks, and then a lot of cleanup work.\nThis is a developing story.

The site provides a spreadsheet version of an AI system much like ChatGPT 2. Sure, thats old tech, but the fundamentals are the same as the current crop of AI programs. There are several lesson videos that explain it all, with the promise of more to come. You can also, of course, grab the actual spreadsheet.\nThe spreadsheet is big, and there are certain compromises. For one thing, you have to enter tokens separately. There are 768 numbers representing each token in the input. Thats a lot for a spreadsheet, but a modern GPT uses many more.\n\nAs this is written, there are only two lesson videos and a general walk-through video for people who already understand the AI architecture and just want to know how the spreadsheet works. We are hoping to see more, but since you have the spreadsheet, you can also work ahead if you have the courage to do so. The two existing lessons show a high-level overview and a unit on tokenization.\nWe like the idea of putting complex topics into understandable spreadsheets. You wont really use them, but you can easily dissect them. Weve given that treatment to DSP and CPUs.\n", "title": "AI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u8868\u3059\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306eAI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3001AI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u304c\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30022\u672c\u306e\u6388\u696d\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001DSP\u3084CPU\u306a\u3069\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["AI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u8868\u3059\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fAI\u5165\u9580\u30ec\u30c3\u30b9\u30f3", "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076AI\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3", "\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u5411\u3051\uff1aAI\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30c8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5206\u89e3"]}

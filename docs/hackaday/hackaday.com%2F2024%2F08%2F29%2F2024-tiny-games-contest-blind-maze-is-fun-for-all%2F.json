You can see all the places you can and cant go, and if you use a pencil instead of a pen, well, thats almost like cheating.\nHowever, using a pencil is pretty much a necessity to play [penumbriel]s Blind Maze. In this game, you cant even see the maze, or where you are. Well, thats not exactly true  you can touch the wall (or lack thereof) in front of you and to the sides, but thats it. So youre going to need that pencil to draw out a map as you go along.\nThis game runs on an Arduino Nano and a 18650 cell. There are three LEDs deep within the enclosure, which is meant to give the depth of walls. But, even the vision-impaired can play the Blind Maze, because theres haptic feedback thanks to a small vibration motor.\nIf you want to play in hard mode, theres a hidden paperclip-accessible switch that turns off the LEDs. This way, you have to rely on hitting the walls with your head. Be sure to check out the video below.\n\n\n \n\n"}

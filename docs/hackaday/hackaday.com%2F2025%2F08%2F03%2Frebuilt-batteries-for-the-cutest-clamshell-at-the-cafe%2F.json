While one could simply live without the battery, thats not going to give you the full retro experience. Replacement batteries are long out of stock, so what can one do? Well, one can check out this excellent tutorial by [lazd] on rebuilding an iBook G3 Clamshell battery.\nEven if you dont have this particular laptop, the general process is likely to be similar for PC laptops of similar vintage. (Which we still cant believe is a whole quarter-century ago.) Luckily for retrocomputer enthusiasts, even Apple used standard 18650 cells in those bygone, halcyon days when computers were allowed to be more than a few atoms thick. They do need to be unprotected, flat-top cells, but thats easy enough to source.\nSo its really a matter of carefully prying apart the casing (apparently it needs to be Apple-branded; aftermarket cases cant survive being opened), removing the old batteries, and welding nickel tabs onto the new cells in the proper configuration. One thing that surprised us is that, apparently, Apple did not go in for balancing in those days  so make sure your cells are all in perfect condition and all equally charged before you start, or things wont end nicely.\nAs always, battery orientation matters! The cells are welded into two sets in this Clamshell iBook battery.\nAssuming you can pull it off (and your battery packs control chip has lasted the 300 moons since its manufacture), youll get a not-insignificant 5-hour battery run out of whats sure to be the cutest clamshell computer at the cafe.\nIf you are repairing an iBook, while youre at it, why not upgrade the RAM? You might even be able to fix the screen if its succumbing to the sadly-too-common vinegar syndrome."}

The Micro-Scan is a fairly plan metal box with a single Tune knob on the front. At the back is a power switch and connectors for TV Antenna, TV Set, and MW (probably meaning microwave). Theres no other data. What was this, and what was it for?\nSatellite TV worked by having a dish receive microwave signals, but televisions could not use those signals directly. A downconverter was needed to turn the signal into something an indoor receiver box (to which the television was attached) could use, allowing the user to select a channel to feed into the TV.\nAt first, [VWestlife] suspected the Micro-Scan was a form of simple downconverter, but that turned out to not be the case. Testing showed that the box didnt modify signals at all. Opening it up revealed the Micro-Scan acts as a combination switchbox and variable power supply, sending a regulated 12-16 V (depending on knob position) out the MW connector.\nSo what is it for, and what does that Tune knob do? When powered off, the Micro-Scan connected the TV (plugged into the TV Set connector) to its normal external antenna (connected to TV Antenna) and the TV worked like a normal television. When powered on, the TV would instead be connected to the MW connector, probably to a remote downconverter. In addition, the Micro-Scan supplied a voltage (the 12-16 V) on that connector, which was probably a control voltage responsible for tuning the downconverter. The resulting signal was passed unmodified to the TV.\nIt can be a challenge to investigate vintage equipment modern TV no longer needs, especially hardware that doesnt fit the usual way things were done, and lacks documentation. If youd like to see a walkthrough and some hands-on with the Micro-Scan, check out the video (embedded bel0w).\n\n"}

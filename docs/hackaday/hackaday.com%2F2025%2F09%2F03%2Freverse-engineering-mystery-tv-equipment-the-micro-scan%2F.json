The Micro-Scan is a fairly plan metal box with a single Tune knob on the front. At the back is a power switch and connectors for TV Antenna, TV Set, and MW (probably meaning microwave). Theres no other data. What was this, and what was it for?\nSatellite TV worked by having a dish receive microwave signals, but televisions could not use those signals directly. A downconverter was needed to turn the signal into something an indoor receiver box (to which the television was attached) could use, allowing the user to select a channel to feed into the TV.\nAt first, [VWestlife] suspected the Micro-Scan was a form of simple downconverter, but that turned out to not be the case. Testing showed that the box didnt modify signals at all. Opening it up revealed the Micro-Scan acts as a combination switchbox and variable power supply, sending a regulated 12-16 V (depending on knob position) out the MW connector.\nSo what is it for, and what does that Tune knob do? When powered off, the Micro-Scan connected the TV (plugged into the TV Set connector) to its normal external antenna (connected to TV Antenna) and the TV worked like a normal television. When powered on, the TV would instead be connected to the MW connector, probably to a remote downconverter. In addition, the Micro-Scan supplied a voltage (the 12-16 V) on that connector, which was probably a control voltage responsible for tuning the downconverter. The resulting signal was passed unmodified to the TV.\nIt can be a challenge to investigate vintage equipment modern TV no longer needs, especially hardware that doesnt fit the usual way things were done, and lacks documentation. If youd like to see a walkthrough and some hands-on with the Micro-Scan, check out the video (embedded bel0w).\n\n", "title": "- \u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u885b\u661f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6a5f\u5668\u300cMicro-Scan\u300d", "body": "Micro-Scan\u306f80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u885b\u661fTV\u6280\u8853\u3067\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u5909\u66f4\u305b\u305a\u3001\u96fb\u5727\u4f9b\u7d66\u3092\u884c\u3046\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u885b\u661f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6a5f\u5668\u300cMicro-Scan\u300d", "- Micro-Scan\u306e\u8b0e\uff1a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u5909\u66f4\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3068\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\uff1aMicro-Scan\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u89e3\u6790\uff1aMicro-Scan\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3068\u52d5\u4f5c", "- \u885b\u661f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\uff1aMicro-Scan\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

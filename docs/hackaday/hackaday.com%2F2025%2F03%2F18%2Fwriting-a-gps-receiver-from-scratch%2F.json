Not only does it allow for locating objects precisely anywhere on the planet, but it also enables the turn-by-turn directions we take for granted these days  all without needing anything more than a radio receiver and some software to decode the signals constantly being sent down from space. [Chris] took that last bit bit as somewhat of a challenge and set off to write a software-defined GPS receiver from the ground up.\nAs GPS started as a military technology, the level of precision needed for things like turn-by-turn navigation wasnt always available to civilians. The coarse positioning is only capable of accuracy within a few hundred meters so this legacy capability is the first thing that [Chris] tackles here. It is pretty fast, though, with the system able to resolve a location in 24 seconds from cold start and then displaying its information in a browser window. Everything in this build is done in Python as well, meaning that its a great starting point for investigating how GPS works and for building other projects from there.\nThe other thing that makes this project accessible is that the only other hardware needed besides a computer that runs Python is an RTL-SDR dongle. These inexpensive TV dongles ushered in a software-defined radio revolution about a decade ago when it was found that they could receive a wide array of radio signals beyond just TV.", "title": "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u578bGPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "GPS\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001Python\u3067\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u578bGPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "Python\u3067\u5b66\u3076GPS\u6280\u8853\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "\u624b\u9803\u306aRTL-SDR\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bGPS\u53d7\u4fe1", "GPS\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u81ea\u4f5cGPS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580"]}

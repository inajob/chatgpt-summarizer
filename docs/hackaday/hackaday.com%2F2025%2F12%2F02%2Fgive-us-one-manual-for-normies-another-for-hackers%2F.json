Youve found a beautiful piece of older hardware at the thrift store, and bought it for a song. You rush it home, eager to tinker, but you soon find its just not working. You open it up to attempt a repair, but you could really use some information on what youre looking at and how to enter service mode. Only a Google search turns up nothing but dodgy websites offering blurry PDFs for entirely the wrong model, and youre out of luck.\nThese days, when you buy an appliance, the best documentation you can expect is a Quick Start guide and a warranty card youll never use. Manufacturers simply dont want to give you real information, because they think the average consumer will get scared and confused. I think they can do better. Im demanding a new two-tier documentation system\u2014the basics for the normies, and real manuals for the tech heads out there.\n\nGive Us The Goods\nOnce upon a time, appliances came with\u00a0real manuals and\u00a0real documentation. You could buy a radio that came with a full list of valves that were used inside, while telephones used to come with printed circuit diagrams right inside the case. But then the world changed, and a new phrase became a common sight on consumer goods\u2014NO USER SERVICABLE PARTS INSIDE. No more was the end user considered qualified or able to peek within the case of the hardware theyd bought. They were fools who could barely be trusted to turn the thing on and work it properly, let alone intervene in the event something needed attention.\nThis attitude has only grown over the years. As our devices have become ever more complex, the documentation delivered with them has shrunk to almost non-existent proportions. Where a Sony television manual from the 1980s contained a complete schematic of the whole set, a modern smartphone might only include a QR code linking to basic setup instructions on a website online. Its all part of an effort by companies to protect the consumer from themselves, because they surely cant be trusted with the arcane knowledge of what goes on inside a modern device.\nThis Sony tv manual from 1985 contained the complete electrical schematics for the set. byu/a_seventh_knot inmildlyinteresting\n\nThis sort of intensely technical documentation was the norm just a few decades ago.\nSome vintage appliances used to actually have the schematic printed inside the case for easy servicing.

With the ongoing decline in literacy rates, its perhaps a smart move by companies to not include any further information than that. Long words and technical information would just make it harder for these customers to figure out how to use the TV in the first place, and they might instead choose a brand that offers simpler documentation.\nThis doesnt feel fair for the power user set. There are many of us who want to know how to change our televisions color mode, how to tinker with the motion smoothing settings, and how to enter deeper service modes when something seems awry. And yet, that information is kept from us quite intentionally. Often, its only accessible in service manuals that are only made available through obscure channels to selected people authorised by OEMs.\nTwo Tiers, Please\nFinding old service manuals can be a crapshoot, but sometimes you get lucky with popular models. Credit: Google via screenshot\nI dont think it has to be this way. I think its perfectly fine for manufacturers to include simple, easy-to-follow instructions with consumer goods. However, I dont think that should preclude them from also offering detailed technical manuals for those users that want and need them. I think, in fact, that these should be readily available as a matter of course.\nCall it a superuser manual, and have it only available via a QR code in the back of the basic, regular documentation. Call it an Advanced Technical Supplement or a Calibration And Maintenance Appendix. Whatever jargon scares off the normies so they dont accidentally come across it and then complain to tech support that they dont know why their user interface is now only displaying garbled arcane runes. It can be a little hard to find, but at the end of the day, it should be a simple PDF that can be downloaded without a lot of hurdles or paywalls.\nIm not expecting manufacturers to go back to giving us full schematics for everything. It would be nice, but realistically its probably overkill. You can just imagine what that would like for a modern smartphone or even just a garden variety automobile in 2025. However, I think its pretty reasonable to expect something better than the bare basics of how to interact with the software and such. The techier manuals should, at a minimum, indicate how to do things like execute a full reset, enter any service modes, and indicate how the device is\u00a0 to be safely assembled and disassembled should one wish to execute repairs.\nOf course, this wont help those of us repairing older gear from the 90s and beyond. If you want to fix that old S-VHS camcorder from 1995, youre still going to have to go to some weird website and risk your credit card details over a $30 charge for a service manual that might cover your problem. But it would be a great help for any new gear moving forward. Forums died years ago, so we can no longer Google for a post from some old retired tech who remembers the secret key combination to enter the service menu. We need that stuff hosted on manufacturer websites so we can get it in five minutes instead of five hours of strenuous research.\nWill any manufacturers actually listen to this demand? Probably, no. This sort of change needs to happen at a higher level. Perhaps the right to repair movement and some boisterous EU legislation could make it happen. After all, there is an increasing clamour for users to have more rights over the hardware and appliances they pay for. If and when it happens, I will be cheering when the first manuals for techies become available. Heaven knows we deserve them!"}

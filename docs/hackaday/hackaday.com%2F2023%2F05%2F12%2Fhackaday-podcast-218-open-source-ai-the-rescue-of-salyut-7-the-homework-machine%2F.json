Show us what youve got on the analog front, and then see what you can do to help people with disabilities to live better lives!\nKristina is still striking out on Whats That Sound, which this week honestly sounded much more horrendous and mechanical than the thing it actually is. Then its on to the hacks, beginning with the we-told-you-so that even Google believes that open source AI will out-compete both Googles own AI and the questionably-named OpenAI.\nFrom there we take a look at a light-up breadboard, listen to some magnetite music, and look inside a pair of smart sunglasses. Finally, we talk cars, beginning with the bleeding edge of driver-less. Then we go back in time to discuss in-vehicle record players of the late 1950s.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0 the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\n\nEpisode 218 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nOp Amp Challenge\n2023 Hackaday Prize Challenge 2: Assistive Tech\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Rick] who correctly guessed that the sound was a coffee percolator!

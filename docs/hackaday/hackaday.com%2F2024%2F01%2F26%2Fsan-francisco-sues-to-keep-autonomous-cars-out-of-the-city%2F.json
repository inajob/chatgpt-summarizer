Yet despite approval by the relevant authorities, the city of San Francisco has opted to sue the state commission that approved Googles Waymo and GMs Cruise. Their goal? To banish these services from the streets of SF, ideally forever.\nWhether they will succeed in this seems highly doubtful. Although Cruise has lost its license to operate in California after a recent fatal accident, Waymos track record is actually quite good. Using public information sources, theres a case to be made that Waymo cars are significantly safer to be in or around than those driven by human operators. When contrasted with Cruises troubled performance, it would seem that the problem with self-driving cars isnt so much the technology as it is the safety culture of the company around it.\nYet despite Waymos better-than-humans safety record, it is regarded as a nuisance, leading some to sabotage the cars. The more reasonable take would seem to be that although technology is not mature yet, it has the overwhelming advantage over human drivers that it never drives distracted or intoxicated, and can be deterministically improved and tweaked across all cars based on experiences.\nThese considerations have been taken into account by the state commission that has approved Waymo operating in SF, which is why legal experts note that SF cases chances are very slim based on the available evidence.", "title": "\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u7981\u6b62\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b", "body": "\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u5e02\u306fWaymo\u3068GM\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u7981\u6b62\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u8a34\u8a1f\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6210\u529f\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002Waymo\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u8a18\u9332\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3067\u3001\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u624b\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5b89\u5168\u3060\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001Waymo\u306f\u8ff7\u60d1\u884c\u70ba\u306e\u6a19\u7684\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u307e\u3060\u6280\u8853\u304c\u6210\u719f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u610f\u898b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u6280\u8853\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u6563\u3089\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3082\u9154\u3063\u6255\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3082\u306a\u304f\u3001\u7d4c\u9a13\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u6539\u5584\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308aWaymo\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u8a31\u53ef\u304c\u51fa\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u7981\u6b62\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u3088\u308a\u5b89\u5168\u3068\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0", "\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u5316\u306e\u554f\u984c", "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u3078\u306e\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u304c\u554f\u984c\u8996\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u306f\u6210\u719f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3068\u6539\u5584\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064"]}

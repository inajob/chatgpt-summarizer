Range anxiety is ebbing away as batteries become bigger and chargers become more frequent, but a few well-publicized incidents have raised worries over fire safety.\nLithium-ion batteries can ignite in the wrong circumstances, and when they do so they are extremely difficult to extinguish. Renault has a solution, and in a rare moment for the car industry, they are sharing it freely for all manufacturers to use.\nThe innovation in question is their Fireman Access Port, a standardized means for a fire crew to connect up their hoses directly to the battery pack and attack the fire at its source. An opening is covered by an adhesive disk designed to protect the cells, but breaks under a jet of high-pressure water. Thermal runaway can then be halted much more easily.\nThe licensing terms not only allow use of the access port itself, but also require any enhancements be shared with the rest of the community of automakers using the system. This was the part which caught our interest, because even if it doesnt come from the same place as the licences were used to, it sounds a lot like open source to us.\nOddly, this is not the first time Renault have open-sourced their technology, in the past theyve shared an entire car.", "title": "- \u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u706b\u707d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\uff1a\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30de\u30f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u300d", "body": "\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306f\u6d88\u706b\u7528\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u3001\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u706b\u707d\u5bfe\u7b56\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u706b\u707d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\uff1a\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30de\u30f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u300d", "- \u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u3001\u96fb\u6c60\u706b\u707d\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u7121\u511f\u516c\u958b", "- \u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u706b\u707d\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u7cbe\u795e\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u696d\u754c\uff1a\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "- \u6d88\u8cbb\u8005\u306e\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u6280\u8853\u9769\u65b0"]}

At first glance, the diminutive components can be quite intimidating  how can you possibly work with parts that are literally smaller than a grain of rice? But of course, like anything else, with practice comes proficiency.\nIts at this silicon precipice that [Larry Bank] recently found himself. While better known on these pages for his software exploits, he recently decided to add SMD electronics to his repertoire by designing and assembling a pocket-sized CO2 monitor. While the monitor itself is a neat gadget that would be worthy of these pages on its own, whats really compelling about this write-up is how it documents the journey from SMD skeptic to convert in a very personal way.\nA fine-tipped applicator will get the solder paste where it needs to go.\nAt first, [Larry] admits to being put off by projects using SMD parts, assuming (not unreasonably) that it would require a significant investment in time and money. But eventually he realized that he could start small and work his way up; for less than $100 USD he was able to pick up both a hot air rework station and a hotplate, which is more than enough to get started with a wide range of SMD components. He experimented with using solder stencils, but even there, ultimately found them to be an unnecessary expense for many projects.\nWhile the bulk of the page details the process of assembling the board, [Larry] does provide some technical details on the device itself. Its powered by the incredibly cheap CH32V003 microcontroller  they cost him less than twenty cents each for fifty of the things  paired with the ubiquitous 12864 SSD1306 OLED, TP4057 charge controller, and a SCD40 CO2 sensor.\nWhether you want to build your own portable CO2 sensor (which judging from the video below, is quite nice), or youre just looking for some tips on how to leave those through-hole parts in the past, [Larry] has you covered. Were particularly eager to see more of his work with the CH32V003, which is quickly becoming a must-have in the modern hardware hackers arsenal.\n\n", "title": "SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u521d\u3081\u3066\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eCO2\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066", "body": "Larry Bank\u306f\u81ea\u8eab\u306e\u30ec\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u306bSMD\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eCO2\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u6700\u521d\u3001SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u3072\u304b\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u306f\u5c11\u984d\u306e\u6295\u8cc7\u3067\u59cb\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5b66\u3093\u3060\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3084\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a18\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u521d\u3081\u3066\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eCO2\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066", "SMD\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u9053\u5177\u3068\u8cbb\u7528", "SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068OLED\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fCO2\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "\u96fb\u5b50\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306aCH32V003\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

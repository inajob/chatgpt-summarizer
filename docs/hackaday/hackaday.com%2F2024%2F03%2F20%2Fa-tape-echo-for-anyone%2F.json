One of the simplest of those is the tape echo, as distinct from a reverb which introduces the many delayed echoes of a large auditorium, an echo provides a single delayed version of the original. Its something [Mark Gutierez] shows us as he makes a tape echo from a cheap Walkman-style cassette player. Its hardly the highest quality of its ilk, but it does the job.\nThe player in question sports the ubiquitous Chinese mechanism thats the last still in production. It has a radio incorporated which he doesnt use, but for all that it has only a permanent magnet erase head rather than one driven from the bias oscillator. He first puts another head in the space between the record head and the pinch roller, then further modifies the cassette so a loop can be pulled out of the side of it, moving all heads off-board. As you can see in the video below the break its in no way high-fidelity, but with a couple of Eurorack mixer kits added on it makes for an interesting effect.\nIf you can lay your hands on a reel-to-reel machine, you can make a more traditional echo machine.\n\n"}

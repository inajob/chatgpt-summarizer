If you want to control all that in an intuitive and realistic manner, youll want to build yourself a decent button pad like [Chris Haye] has done. Its surprisingly easy, too!\nVery cool.\n[Chris] is quite a serious racer, and needed\u00a0four button boxes. He wanted to do this on the cheap, so he decided to build his first three boxes around the Zero Delay Arcade USB Encoder, a cheap controller board available on eBay for around \u00a37. Arcade buttons were sourced off Amazon to populate the black project boxes which acted as the housings.\nHis final button pad looks straight out of a GT3 race car, but its the simplest of the bunch. Its literally just a USB numpad with a carbon vinyl wrap applied and some home-printed labels. One suspects the feel isnt particularly high-quality but the look is top tier. If youre a streamer that wants to build a hardcore-looking setup, this is a great way to go.\n[Chris] estimates that each box took maybe an hour to build, tops. Its a great example of solution-focused design. He could have gotten out his own microcontroller and done a custom PCB and all that, and the results surely would have been good. But it would have taken far longer! Its hard to beat the speed of wiring together Amazon arcade buttons with the Arcade USB Encoders pre-terminated wire harness. If youre more interested in sim racing than building button boxes, its a great way to do a custom pad fast.\nBest of all? [Chris] says he managed to put these all together for \u00a360\u2014quite a feat of bargain engineering. Weve featured some other builds along these lines before, too\u2014even using vintage aircraft controls!

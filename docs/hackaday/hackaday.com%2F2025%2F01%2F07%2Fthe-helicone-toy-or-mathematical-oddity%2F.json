The toy is cool all by itself, but the video shows how a sufficiently large heliocone models many natural numbers and acts, as [Mathologer] puts it, acts as microscope to probe the nature of numbers.\nThe chief number of interest is the so-called golden ratio. A virtual model of the toy allows easy experimentation and even some things that arent easily possible in the real world. The virtual helicone also allows you to make a crazy number of layers, which can show certain mathematical ideas that would be hard to do in a 3D print or a wooden toy.\nApparently, the helicone was [John Edmarks] sculpture inspired by DNA spirals, so it is no surprise it closely models nature. You can 3D print a real one.\nOf course, the constant \u03c0 makes an appearance. Like fractals, you can dive into the math or just enjoy the pretty patterns. We wont judge either way.\nWeve seen math sequences in clocks that remind us of [Piet Mondrian]. In fact, weve seen more than one of those.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u6570\u5b66\u3068\u81ea\u7136\u3092\u7d50\u3076\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083", "body": "\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u304c\u6570\u5b66\u3068\u6df1\u3044\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u7279\u306b\u9ec4\u91d1\u6bd4\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u6570\u5b66\u3068\u81ea\u7136\u3092\u7d50\u3076\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083", "- \u6570\u5b66\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\uff1a\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u9ec4\u91d1\u6bd4\u3068\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\uff1a\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u7f8e\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080", "- \u4eee\u60f3\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u7121\u9650\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- DNA\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\uff1a\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055"]}

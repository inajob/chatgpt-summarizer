This version 0.01 was still an Alpha release, with 0.1 from 1998 the first Beta and the first stable release (1.0, released on September 3 2006) still a while off. Even so, its main developer [Jim Hall] and the like-minded developers on the FreeDOS team managed to put together a very functional DOS using a shell, kernel and other elements which already partially existed before the FreeDOS (initially PD-DOS, for Public Domain DOS) idea was pitched by [Jim].\nNearly thirty years later, [Jim] reflects on these decades, and the strong uptake of what to many today would seem to be just a version of an antiquated OS. When it comes to embedded and industrial applications, of course, a simple DOS is all you want and need, not to mention for a utility you boot from a USB stick. Within the retro computing community FreeDOS has proven to be a boon as well, allowing for old PCs to use a modern DOS rather than being stuck on a version of MS-DOS from the early 90s.\nFor FreeDOS future, [Jim] is excited to see what other applications people may find for this OS, including as a teaching tool on account of how uncomplicated FreeDOS is. In a world of complicated OSes that no single mortal can comprehend any more, FreeDOS is really quite a breath of fresh air.", "title": "\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306aFreeDOS\u30de\u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBlinky\u300d", "body": "1994\u5e749\u6708\u306b\u6700\u521d\u306eFreeDOS\u7248\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002MS-DOS\u306e\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u6b62\u5f8c\u3001FreeDOS\u306f\u9032\u5316\u3057\u30012006\u5e74\u306b\u6700\u521d\u306e\u5b89\u5b9a\u7248\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30022021\u5e74\u6642\u70b9\u3067\u306f\u516c\u5f0f\u306a\u5229\u7528\u8005\u3082\u304a\u308a\u3001\u53e4\u3044PC\u306b\u6700\u65b0\u306eDOS\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306aFreeDOS\u30de\u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBlinky\u300d", "FreeDOS\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u3068\u9032\u5316", "FreeDOS: \u904e\u53bb\u3068\u672a\u6765", "FreeDOS\u3068\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "FreeDOS\uff1a\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

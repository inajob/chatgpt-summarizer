The Trace Line Clock has smooth lines and a clean presentation, with no sockets or visible mechanical fixtures.\nReading the clock is quite straightforward once one knows what is going on. At its heart, the unmarked face is much like any other analog clock face, and on the inside is a pretty normal clock movement. The inner recessed track on the face represents hours, and the outer is minutes. The blue line connects the two, drawing a constantly changing line.\n\nSped-up footage shows how the line moves.\nTo make the blue segment move without breaking the lines of the clock, [byeh_ in] uses magnets. The inside end moves around the inner ring with the hour hand, while the rest of the blue segment follows the minute hand. Since the length between these two points is not constant, [byeh_ in] cleverly designed one of the magnets to be floating. By keeping the magnet captive in a channel on the underside of the blue segment, the whole thing moves smoothly, no matter how the two hands align.\nSpeaking of smooth, its important for the parts to move together with minimal friction. To achieve this [byeh_ in] uses something we think is under-utilized in 3D printed parts: candle wax. Wax is non-greasy, sticks well to 3D printed parts simply by rubbing, slides easily, and doesnt make a mess. Directions and 3D models are available should you wish to try making your own.\nWere always delighted by the amazingly different ways people can re-imagine a clock. From clocks with hands but void of a face\u00a0to clocks made out of clocks, we love to see em so if youve got a favorite, drop us a tip!", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u6642\u8a08\u306f\u3001\u78c1\u77f3\u3067\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u306b\u52d5\u304d\u307e\u3059\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u306f\u874b\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u6469\u64e6\u3092\u6e1b\u5c11\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "- \u78c1\u77f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u52d5\u304d", "- \u874b\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

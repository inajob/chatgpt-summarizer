Ive got boxes and boxes of weirdo bits and bobs, and piles of devices that Ill eventually get around to stripping down into even more bits and bobs. Despite regular purges  I try to bring a car-load of crap treasure to local hackerspaces and meetups at least a couple times a year  the pile only continues to grow.\nBut the problem isnt limited to hardware components. Theres all sorts of things that the logical part of me understands Ill almost certainly never need, and yet I cant bring myself to dispose of. One of those things just so happens to be documents. Anything printed is fair game. Could be the notes from my last appointment with the doctor, or fliers for events I attended years ago. Doesnt matter, the stacks keep building up until I end up cramming it all into a box and start the whole process starts over again.\nIve largely convinced myself that the perennial accumulation of electronic bric-\u00e0-brac is an occupational hazard, and have come to terms with it. But I think theres a good chance of moving the needle on the document situation, and if that involves a bit of high-tech overengineering, even better. As such, Ive spent the last couple of weeks investigating digitizing the documents that have information worth retaining so that the originals can be sent along to Valhalla in my fire pit.\nThe following represents some of my observations thus far, in the hopes that others going down a similar path may find them useful. But what Im really interested in is hearing from the Hackaday community. Surely Im not the only one trying to save some storage space by turn piles of papers into ones and zeros.\n\nTake a Picture, Itll Last Longer\nObviously, the first step in digitizing physical documents is image capture. The most obvious way to accomplish this is to simply use a flatbed scanner, and in some cases, theres a solid argument to be made that its the best approach. Indeed, many of the documents that Ive already filed away digitally were created this way. But its a tedious enough process that you may want to consider alternative methods.\nIf youve got a decent camera, you can get a couple of lights and put together a nice overhead photography rig without spending too much money. Put your document down under the camera, snap a picture, and keep it moving.\nImaging doesnt get any faster than taking a picture, and so long as youre not using some point and shoot from the early 2000s, the resolution should be more than sufficient. This method is particularly appealing if youre planning on digitizing books or anything else that cant be laid perfectly flat on a scanner.\nThe major downside with this approach is the setup itself. Its one thing if youre digitizing documents and books on a daily basis, but for occasional use, putting something like this together is a big ask. A flatbed scanner certainly takes up a lot less room, and you dont have to worry about getting the lighting right, mounting the camera, and so on.\nCasting Some Magick\nWhether you used a scanner or a camera, once you have the image of your document, youve technically digitized it. Congratulations, youre now an amateur archivist.\nIf youre looking to keep things simple, you could stop here. Stash the files someplace and be done with it. But depending on the type of content youre working with and what your goals are, theres a good chance youll want to touch up the images a bit. Luckily for us, the incredible ImageMagick project has many of the functions we need built-in, from cropping and resizing, all the way to image enhancement.\nConsider the image below. Its clear enough to read, but the text is rotated and the lighting isnt consistent across the entire page.\n\nWe can fix both issues with a simple ImageMagick command via the convert tool:\nconvert input.png -deskew 30% -threshold 25% output.png\nWe wont get too bogged down in the details, the ImageMagick documentation can break it all down better than I can. The short version is that were telling it to straighten out the image and convert it into pure black and white. The result looks like this:\n\nThe values can be tweaked a bit to refine the result, and as you might imagine there are many other ImageMagick functions that could potentially be brought in to clean up the result. Things do get more complicated if youre working with something more complex than plain text, but you get the general idea.\nThis sort of post-processing is especially important if you plan on running the images through any sort of optical character recognition (OCR) to capture the actual text of the document. That first image might be perfectly legible to our human eyeballs. You might even prefer it over the stark look of the processed image, but tools like tesseract have a hell of a time picking the text out when the background isnt uniform.\nTheres an App For That\nThe process described here certainly isnt for everyone, and thats fine. If youre not looking to invest the sort of time and effort it would take to make this work, theres fortunately a far more approachable solution available. In fact, it might already be in your pocket.\nThe Google Drive mobile application offers a very impressive document scanning mode that essentially automates everything above. If you give it access to your devices camera, it will automagically detect documents in the field of view, find their edges, compensate for angle and rotation to straighten out the image, and even run it through filters to make the text pop. Its fast, works reasonably well, and is exceptionally handy for cranking out multi-page PDFs.\nThe downside is that youve got relatively little control over the process, and being a product of Google, theres the usual concerns over what they may be doing with the information thats passing through the system. For these reasons its not something I would personally recommend for any private information, and its automatic nature the lack of fine-grained control means it may not be a great choice if your needs venture too far from the beaten path.\nStill, the speed and ease of use it offers is admittedly very attractive.\nOpen to Suggestions\nId love to hear the communitys thoughts on digitization, whether its hardware or software related. Theres surely some slick projects out there that aid in creating bespoke digital libraries, and theres plenty of areas where real-world experience can help streamline and improve the overall process. For example, whats your file naming convention look like?\nHackaday readers are rarely shy about sharing their opinions, so lets hear them."}

(Credit: Gamers Nexus)\nIn the olden days of the 1990s and early 2000s, PCs were big and videocards were small-ish add-in boards that blended in with other ISA, PCI and AGP cards. These days, however, videocards are big and computers are increasingly smaller. Thats why US-based CherryTree Computers did what everyone has been joking about, and installed a PC inside a GPU, with [Gamers Nexus] having the honors of poking at the creatively titled\u00a0GeeFarce 5027POS Micro Computer.\nAs CherryTree describes it on their website, this one-off build was the result of a joke about how GPUs nowadays are more expensive than the rest of the PC combined. Thus they did what any reasonable person would do and put an Asus NUC 13 with a 13th gen Core i7, 64 GB of and 2 TB of NVMe storage inside an (already dead) Asus Aorus RTX 2070 GPU.\nIn the [Gamers Nexus] video we can see that its definitely a quick-and-dirty build, with plenty of heatshrink and wires running everywhere in addition to the chopped off original heatsink. That said, from a few meter away it still looks like a GPU, can be installed like a GPU (but the PCIe connector does nothing) and is in the end a NUC PC inside a GPU shell that you can put a couple of inside a PC case.\nPresumably the next project well see in this vein will see a full-blown x86 system grafted inside a still functioning GPU, which would truly make the install the PC inside the GPU meme a reality.\n\n", "title": "- GPU\u306e\u4e2d\u306bPC\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\uff01CherryTree\u306e\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "CherryTree\u304cGPU\u5185\u306bPC\u3092\u7d44\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u5947\u629c\u306a\u300cGeeFarce 5027POS\u300d\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["- GPU\u306e\u4e2d\u306bPC\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\uff01CherryTree\u306e\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff1aGPU\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u9769\u65b0\uff1aGeeFarce 5027POS\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "- RTX 2070\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308bGPU\u306bPC\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u6311\u6226"]}

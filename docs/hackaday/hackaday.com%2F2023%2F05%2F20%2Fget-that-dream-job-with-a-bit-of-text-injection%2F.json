At various times there have also been dubious psychometric tests and other horrors to contend with, and now we have the specter of AI before us. We can be tossed aside simply because some AI model has rejected our CV, no human involved. If this has made you angry, perhaps its time to look at [Kai Greshake]s work. Hes fighting back, by injecting a PDF CV with extra text to fool the AI into seeing the perfect candidate, and even fooling AI-based summarizers.\nText injection into a PDF is a technique the same as used by the less salubrious end of the search engine marketing world, of placing text in a web page such that a human cant read it but a machine can. The search engine marketeers put them in tiny white text or offset them far out of the viewport, and it seems the same is possible in a PDF. Hes put the injection in white and a tiny font, and interestingly, overlaid it several times.\nUsing the ChatGPT instance available in the Bing sidebar hes then able to fool it into an affirmative replay to questions about whether he should be hired. But its not just ChatGPT hes targeting, another use of AI in recruitment is via summarizing tools. By injecting a lot of text with phrases normally used in conclusion of a document, hes able to make Quillbot talk about puppies. Fancy a go yourself? Hes put a summarizer online, in the link above.\nSo maybe the all-seeing AI isnt as clever as weve been led to believe. Whod have thought it!"}

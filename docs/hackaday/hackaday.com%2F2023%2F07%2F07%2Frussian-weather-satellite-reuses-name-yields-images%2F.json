According to [saveitforparts], pretty much all of them. He showed how to grab images from an earlier satellite with the same name a while back. That satellite, though, met with some kind of disaster, so hes posted a new video about reading data from the new Meteor 2 and you can watch it below.\nThe interesting part, we thought, was that the software hes using, Raspberry-NOAA v2, doesnt know about this incarnation of the bird which has only been up for a few weeks. That means he had to find a satellite with similar orbital parameters. Eventually, the program will have the setup for this satellite.\n\nWe marvel that computer technology is to the point that he can casually say, I have another Linux computer up on the roof In addition to using Raspberry-NOAA, he acquires data from the pass directly with his SDR. Things didnt go very well, but watching the steps he tries is instructive. He uses a variety of tools and finally gets a better result.\nThe image was higher quality than the NOAA satellites, but he had gaps in the pictures, and he couldnt figure out why multiple runs of satdump didnt produce the same results. If you have an SDR dongle and an antenna, you can find links to all the software and try it yourself.\nIf you need an antenna or want to listen to NOAA satellites, we know someone who can help. While the video pokes fun at the Meteor 2 satellites failing, all these kind of satellites do eventually go offline.\n", "title": "\u300c\u65b0\u3057\u3044Meteor 2\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u300cMeteor 2\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u524d\u306e\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u6c17\u8c61\u885b\u661f\u306f\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4ee5\u524d\u306b\u540c\u3058\u540d\u524d\u306e\u885b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u300cMeteor 2\u300d\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u6295\u7a3f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u985e\u4f3c\u3059\u308b\u8ecc\u9053\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6301\u3064\u885b\u661f\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306f\u3053\u306e\u885b\u661f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u306f\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u8907\u6570\u306e\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u540c\u3058\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u7b87\u6240\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u8a66\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u65b0\u3057\u3044Meteor 2\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry-NOAA v2\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u885b\u661f\u3092\u8a8d\u8b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u300d", "\u300cSDR\u3068\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3067\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cMeteor 2\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u300d", "\u300cNOAA\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306b\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u305f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d"]}

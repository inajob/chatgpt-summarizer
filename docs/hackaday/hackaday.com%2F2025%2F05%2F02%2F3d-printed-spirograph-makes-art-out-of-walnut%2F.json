When making elaborate spiral doodles, did you ever wish for a much, much bigger version? [Fortress Fine Woodworks] had that thought, and slapped a router onto it to create a gorgeous walnut table.\nThis printed sanding block was a nice touch.\nThe video covers not only 3D printing the giant Spirograph, which is the part most of us can easily relate to, but all the woodworking magic that goes into creating a large hardwood table. Assembling the table out of choice lumber from the rustic pile is an obvious money-saving move, but there were a lot of other trips and tricks in this video that we were happy to learn from a pro. The 3D printed sanding block he designed was a particularly nice detail; its hard to imagine getting all those grooves smoothed out without it.\nCertainly this pattern could have been carved with a CNC machine, but there is a certain old school charm in seeing it done (more or less) by hand with the Spirograph jig. [Fortress Fine Woodworks] would have missed out on quite the workout if hed been using a CNC machine, too, which may or may not be a plus to this method depending on your perspective. Regardless, the finished product is a work of art and worth checking out in the video below.\nOddly enough, this isnt the first time weve seen someone use a Spirograph to mill things. Its not the first giant-scale Spirograph weve highlighted, either. To our knowledge, its the first time someone has combined them with an artful walnut table.\n\n"}

Reminiscent of that is this neat portable Macintosh Mini, created by [Scott Yu-Jan].\n[Scott] has created something along these lines before\u2014putting an iPad dock on top of a Macintosh Studio to create a look vaguely reminiscent of the very first Macintosh computers. However, that build wasnt portable\u2014it wasnt practical to build such a thing around the Macintosh Studio. In contrast, the Mac Mini is a lithe, lightweight thing that barely sups power\u2014its much more suitable for a luggable computer.\nThe build relies on a 3D printed enclosure that wraps around the Mac Mini like a glove. Inside, theres a chunky 20,800 mAh power bank with enough juice to run the computer for over three hours. Just like the original Mac, theres a handle on top, too. The builds main screen is actually an iPad Mini, hooked up to the Mac Mini. If you want to use it separately, it can be popped out just by pushing it via a cutout in the bottom of the enclosure.\n[Scott] notes that its cool, but not exactly practical\u2014it weighs seven pounds, mostly due to the weight of the heavy power bank. Weve featured [Scotts] stylish builds before, too, like this nice iPhone dock.\n\n", "title": "- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebMacintosh Mini\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Scott Yu-Jan\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebMacintosh Mini\u306f\u3001\u8efd\u91cf\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002iPad Mini\u304c\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebMacintosh Mini\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0Mac Mini\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- iPad Mini\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044Mac\u74b0\u5883", "- \u96fb\u6e90\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3079\u308bMac\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- \u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

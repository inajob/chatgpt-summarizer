We thought it would be great to look back on the history of the Prize and cherry-pick our favorite themes from the past. Last year\u2019s entire theme was sustainable hacking, and we challenged you to come up with ways to generate or save power, keep existing gear out of the landfill, find clever ways to encourage recycling or build devices to monitor the environment and keep communities safer during weather disasters, and you all came through. Now we\u2019re asking you to do it again.\nThere are hundreds of ways that we can all go a little bit lighter on this planet, and our Green Hacks Challenge encourages you to make them real. Whether you want to focus on clean energy, smarter recycling, preventing waste, or even cleaning up the messes that we leave behind, every drop of oil left unburned or gadget kept out of the landfill helps keep our world running a little cleaner. Here\u2019s your chance to hack for the planet.\nInspiration\nOne thing we really loved about last year\u2019s Green Hacks was that it encouraged people to think outside the box. For instance, we got some solar power projects as you\u2019d expect, but we also got a few really interesting wind power entries, ranging from the superbly polished 3D Printed Portable Wind Turbine that won the Grand Prize to the experimental kite turbine in Energy Independence While Travelling, to say nothing of the offbeat research project toward making a Moss Microbial Fuel Cell.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlastic was also in the air last year, as we saw a number of projects to reuse and recycle this abundant element of our waste stream. From a Plastic Scanner that uses simple spectroscopy to determine what type of plastic you\u2019re looking at, to filament recyclers and trash-based 3D printers to make use of shredded plastic chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you all really put the science into citizen science with projects like OpenDendrometer that helps monitor a single tree\u2019s health, and the Crop Water Stress Sensor that does the same for a whole field. Bees didn\u2019t get left out of the data collection party either, with the Beehive Monitoring and Tracking project. And [Andrew Thaler]\u2019s tremendously practical Ocean Sensing for Everyone: The OpenCTD brought the basics of oceanic environmental monitoring down to an affordable level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow It\u2019s Your Turn to be Green\nIf any of the above resonates with your project goals, it\u2019s time to put them into action! Start up a new project over on Hackaday.io, enter it into the Prize, and you\u2019re on your way. Ten finalists will receive $500 and be eligible to win the Grand Prizes ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. But you\u2019ve only got until Tuesday, July 4th to enter, so don\u2019t sleep.\nAs always, we\u2019d like to thank our sponsors in the Hackaday Prize, Supplyframe and DigiKey, but we\u2019d also like to thank Protolabs for sponsoring the Green Hacks challenge specifically, and for donating a $5,000 manufacturing grant for one finalist. Maybe that could be you?\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Hackaday Prize 2023 Green Hacks Challenge: \u5730\u7403\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u767a\u660e\u3092\u52df\u96c6\uff01", "body": "Hackaday Prize\u304c10\u56de\u76ee\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u3001\u4eca\u5e74\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306f\u300c\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u3002\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3084\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u76e3\u8996\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306a\u3069\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6628\u5e74\u306f\u592a\u967d\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u4ee3\u8868\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u591a\u6570\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u5e74\u306f\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u3084\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3001\u8fb2\u4f5c\u7269\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u76e3\u8996\u306b\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3002\u5fdc\u52df\u7de0\u5207\u306f7\u67084\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Hackaday Prize 2023 Green Hacks Challenge: \u5730\u7403\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u767a\u660e\u3092\u52df\u96c6\uff01", "\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u512a\u79c0\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089Green Hacks Challenge\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u304b\u3089\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u76e3\u8996\u307e\u3067\uff1a\u53bb\u5e74\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u304b\u3089\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u307e\u3067\uff1aGreen Hacks Challenge\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30b3\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304c\u3064\u304f\u308b\u3001\u5730\u7403\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u305f\u3061"]}

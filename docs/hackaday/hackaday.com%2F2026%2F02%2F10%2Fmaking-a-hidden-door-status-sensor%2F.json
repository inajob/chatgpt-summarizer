(Credit: Dillan Stock)\nA common sight in smart homes, door sensors allow you to detect whether a door is closed or open, enabling the triggering of specific events. Unfortunately, most solutions for these sensors are relatively bulky and hard to miss, making them a bit of a eyesore. This was the case for [Dillan Stock] as well, who decided that he could definitely have a smart home, yet not have warts sticking out on every single doorframe and door. Theres also a video version of the linked blog post.\nThese door sensors tend to be very simple devices, usually just a magnet and a reed relay, the latter signaling a status change to the wireless transmitter or transceiver. Although [Dillan] had come across recessed door sensors before, like a Z-wave-based unit from Aeotec, this was a very poorly designed product with serious reliability issues.\nThats when [Dillan] realized that he could simply take the PCB from one of the Aqara T1 door sensors that he already had and stuff them into a similar 20 mm diameter form factor as that dodgy sensor unit. Basically this just stuffs the magnet and PCB from an existing wart-style sensor into a recessed form factor, making it a very straightforward hack, that only requires printing the housings for the Aqara T1 sensor and some intimate time between the door and a drill.\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u306a\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u306e\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u76ee\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\u5f62\u72b6\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u306a\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f", "\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "Aqara T1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30bb\u30b9\u578b\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u76ee\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\uff01"]}

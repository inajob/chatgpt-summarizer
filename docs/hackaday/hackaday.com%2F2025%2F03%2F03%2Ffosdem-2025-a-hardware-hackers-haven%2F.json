Its a yearly two-day megaconference in Brussels, every first weekend of February. Thousands of software and hardware hackers from all across Europe come here each year, make friends, talk software and hardware alike, hold project-specific meetups to drink beer and talk shop, and just have a fun weekend surrounded by like-minded people.\nIn particular, FOSDEM has free admission  drop by for the weekend, no need to buy entry tickets, just sort out your accomodation, food, travel, and visit for a day or two. Ive covered FOSDEM quite extensively in 2023, so if you want to know more about how it works, I invite you to check out that article  plenty of stories, cool facts about FOSDEM, showcases, and so on. This year, Ive also been to FOSDEM, its been pretty great, and Id like to tell you about cool things Ive seen happen during FOSDEM 2025.\nFOSDEM is often described as an open software conference, and you mightve had been fooled by this if you simply have checked the Wikipedia page. However, let me assure you  theres always plenty of hardware, large amounts of it! This year, I feel like hardware has taken the spotlight in particular  let me show you at least some of it, so that you know what kinds of cool stuff you can expect and plan for in 2026.\n\nEven Software Was Hardware\nReally, the kinds of software FOSDEM hosts, cant exist without a healthy dose of hardware. Yes, there was no shortage of purely software-specific stands  if you wanted a Debian t-shirt, some Fedora or Jenkins stickers, or a selfie with the Postgresql elephant, they were always at an arms reach. Pure software was a surprisingly small part of FOSDEM this year, and I have some theories about it.\nThis year, it felt like half of all stands were hardware-based, hardware-related, or hardware-dependent in one way or another. First off, of course, hardware is flashy, it makes for effective demos. For instance, if you wanted to drop by, youd find a Jenkins cluster running on a gaggle of SBCs mounted to a 3D-printed frame  a new and vastly improved build from the version weve covered in 2023!\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of project stands  PostmarketOS, CalyxOS, FuriLabs,  had desks full of smartphones demoing their phone OS offerings. Youd see SteamDecks being used as software demo machines, the FreeCAD table had a laptop running the newest FreeCAD install you could poke and probe (with even a surprise MNT Reform appearance), SBCs common and obscure running demo playback and presentations  making the software world tangible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, if youre demoing an open-source smart home system, like OpenHAB did, whats better than bringing a smart-home-in-a-briefcase? And if youre bringing an open-source game engine, whats better than demoing it on a SteamDeck? Software has the disadvantage of being quite intangible, and hardware grounds it enough that anyone can interact it, conveying code as colours, shapes, and objects in the real world  which is perfect if what youre starting with is a Git repository, and what you need to create is a conference table people would be interested in.\nAnd Hardware Was Extra Hardware\nOf course, weve met the usual open-source suspects of the hardware world, too. KiCad and FreeCAD split a table this year. They had logos familiar enough to the crowd that they really didnt need extra hardware to stand out  instead, they brought merch and stickers. Nevertheless, on the FreeCAD-KiCad split of the table, youd find a guest exhibit from the Libre Space Foundation, a model of the Picobus V2 satellite launching system, which was incidentally designed with help of both FreeCAD and KiCad.\nNext to them, youd find MicroPython, Espruino, and TinyGo, all promoting high-level languages for microcontrollers, for those of us unemburdened by obligations of memory safety and static typing. In the H building, OpenFlexure had a desk all to themselves, and a Prusa printer was helping them crank out designs to be immediately demoed. Sadly, this year, Pine64 stand was missing  but Pine64 folks could still be found around!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing youd see a ton this year? LoRa, in all forms. Of course, there was the Meshtastic table, with plenty of stickers and demo devices alike, but youd also regularly find LoRa-equipped devices on tables. This wasnt the only form of wireless tech, either  the AW building had desks with SDR setups, plenty of HAM tech, and outside on the grass, a group of hackers with radio equipment and a dish antenna setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIve seen a couple tables being crashed with cool tech, too! For instance, you could meet [arturo182] and his creations (including a hacker-friendly keyboard module series) on Saturday in the AW building, taking up part of the TinyGo table  not scheduled, but definitely most welcome! On one of the desks in the K building, you could find two MNT Reform demo units, one full-sized and one Pocket, on the Genode table  unsurprisingly, there was always a crowd around that table, so if you didnt notice it, thats why!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more recommendation, which doesnt apply just to FOSDEM  you might want to get a FOSSAsia LED matrix name badge. Nowadays, I tend to go to events in friend groups, and Ive been surprised how many my friends have gotten themselves the FOSSAsia name badges  the FOSSAsia community is a mainstay at tech events in Europe, so if youre visiting one and you see these badges around, just look for the FOSSAsia desk to get one. These badges are respectably flashy  you pick the colour!  great for meeting new people in the crowds, and quite cheap! Ive also learned that FOSSAsia have been improving the badges firmware over the years  as far as I can tell, if youve ever bought a nametag from FOSSAsia, simply update its firmware with help of your smartphone, and get a number of new features.\nEagerly Awaiting FOSDEM 26\nTheres always more to FOSDEM, but this year, Id like to simply show you all the hardware there was to see. Want to learn more? Check back to the FOSDEM 23 coverage, detailing how FOSDEM operates, talking about their volunteer-rooted structure, the principles and tricks FOSDEM uses to keep the open software world ever so closer together, or perhaps the impressive video recording infrastructure making sure that talks are livestreamed dutifully and published nigh-instantly Plenty to learn about FOSDEMs MO! Apart from that, FreeCAD, PostmarketOS, Meshtastic and a good few open-source orgs have made post-FOSDEM blog posts, check them out if youd like to hear how FOSDEM and your favourite projects meshed together.\nFOSDEM is undoubtedly the time and place to celebrate open software in Europe, and at the same time, its also a super friendly spot for those of us of Hackaday upbringing. If youre looking for somewhere to go next February, as a hardware hacker, my understanding is that you wont be disappointed!", "title": "FOSDEM 2025\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5c55\u793a", "body": "FOSDEM\u306f\u6bce\u5e742\u6708\u306e\u521d\u3081\u306b\u30d6\u30ea\u30e5\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["FOSDEM 2025\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5c55\u793a", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u304c\u969b\u7acb\u3064\uff01FOSDEM\u3067\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "FOSDEM\u3067\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30e2\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "FOSDEM 2026\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

So he went completely DIY.\nThis simple and sweet build is now in its third revision, and the refinements show. A first prototype was nothing more than an ESP32 with a screen and some current transformer (CT) sensors to read the current flowing in the wires in his breaker box. The next version added a PCB and a color screen, and the most recent version swapped up to eInk and a nice local power supply, all sized to fit a nice clear power box.\nWhat\u2019s really cute about this design is the use of standard phono jacks to plug the CT sensors into, and the overall sweet combination of a local display and interactivity with [Jon]\u2019s ESPHome-based home automation setup. This design isn\u2019t super complicated, but it doesn\u2019t need to be. It has one job, and it does it nicely. What more do you want?\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting into ESPHome and/or home automation, check out this great ESPHome resource. It\u2019s probably a lot easier than you think, and you can build your system out one module at a time. If you\u2019re like us, once you get started, you\u2019ll find it hard to stop until everything falls under your watchful eyes, if not your control."}

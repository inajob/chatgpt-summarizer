If youre a fan of the machine and want to revisit its glory days, you could hunt one down on an auction site and hope that its in working order. Or you could just emulate the VIC-20 in your browser thanks to the work of [Lance Ewing].\nThe project is called JVic\u2014because its a VIC-20 emulator written in Java. Its primarily intended for playing old VIC-20 games, and is designed with mobile devices front of mind\u2014so it works well on a phone screen. You can enjoy the built-in library of games, or you can even direct JVic to boot up a ROM from a ZIP file hosted on a given URL or attached to a forum post. You can also install it on your own device rather than running it online, if so desired. [Lance] provides a range of setup options for running it locally or putting it on your own web server if thats how you like to do things. Files are on Github for those eager to dive in.\nWe get lots of VIC-20 hacks around these parts. Even if its not the most popular machine that Commodore ever built, its certainly up there in the rankings. If you want to learn Forth, or even build a VIC-20 from scratch, weve explored that before. If youve got your own retrocomputer hacks kicking around, dont hesitate to let us know!\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]", "title": "- VIC-20\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cJVic\u300d\u3067\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "body": "VIC-20\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fcJVic\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- VIC-20\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cJVic\u300d\u3067\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "- Java\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305fVIC-20\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u3082\u904a\u3079\u308b\uff01JVic\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fVIC-20\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308bVIC-20\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- Retro Computing\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01VIC-20\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u52df\u96c6"]}

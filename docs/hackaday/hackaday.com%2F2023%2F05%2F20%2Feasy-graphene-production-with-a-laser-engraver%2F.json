But making small batches of graphene is doable in a few ways. [Robert Murray-Smith] decided to try producing flash graphene. This requires a big capacitor bank that is moderately expensive, so he decided to explain a different technique he read about using an ordinary laser cutter. Check it out in the video below.\nWe were a little disappointed that he didnt actually make any graphene this time. He has, however, used other methods in other videos to create some type of graphene. In fact, he has many similar videos going back quite a ways as well as applications with concrete, capacitors, and more. We understand that this method doesnt produce monolayer graphene, but actually creates a graphene foam with interesting properties. [Robert] talks about recent papers that show you can grow graphene on things other than Kapton tape using this method.\n\nIf you decide youd like to try this out, wed love to see your results. [James Tour] from Rice University has a video about laser-induced graphene that might help you, too. Weve seen [Zachary Tong] using this method, as well. The flash process is interesting, too, because when compared to most other methods it seems more scalable.\n"}

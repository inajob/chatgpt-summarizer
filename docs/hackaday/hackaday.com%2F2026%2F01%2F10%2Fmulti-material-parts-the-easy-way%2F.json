You can also laboriously switch filaments on a single-color printer. But [anonymous kiwi] points out a different way, which is surprisingly obvious once you think about it. You simply add a previously made part to another one.\nIf youve ever experimented with adding a nut or a magnet into a print in the middle, the idea is exactly the same: you print one piece and then print a second piece, pausing in the middle to insert the completed first piece. The video example shows TPU robot wheels with PLA hubs. Of course, the same idea could apply to using different colors or even multiple materials or parts. You could imagine a hub with a steel nut embedded in it, then further being embedded in a TPU wheel, for example.\nWith multi-material printers becoming more commonplace, this technique might seem antiquated. But even if you have one of such a printer, this technique could save time and reduce waste. Not every part would work out this cleanly, but it is something to remember for the times when it does.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u8907\u6570\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u7570\u306a\u308b\u8272\u3084\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u65e2\u88fd\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u9014\u4e2d\u3067\u633f\u5165\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u8907\u6570\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "- \u300c\u7570\u306a\u308b\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u300d", "- \u300c\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4ed6\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u633f\u5165\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "- \u300c\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u7d71\u5408\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300c\u6642\u9593\u3068\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u524a\u6e1b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u300d"]}

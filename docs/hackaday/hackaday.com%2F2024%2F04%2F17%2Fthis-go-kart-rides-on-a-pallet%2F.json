Generally theyre easily found and can be low or no cost, but typically require a bit of work before theyre usable in a project. [Garage Avenger] is looking to do something a little outside of the box with his pallet project, though. Hes using raw pallets as a chassis for a four-speed go-kart, partially for the challenge and excitement and also to one-up a Pinterest post.\nAlmost immediately, though, the other major downside of working with pallets arose which is that theyre generally built out of low-grade pine which is soft and flexible. Flexibility is generally not a good thing to have in a vehicle frame so plenty of the important parts of this build were strengthened with steel tubing including the rear axle, steering mounts, and a few longitudinal supports to strengthen the overall frame. After working out some kinks with ordering a few of the wrong parts, and mounting the steering box backwards, it was time to test out the four-speed engine (and brakes) on the the go-kart, making it nearly ready for the road.\nTo complete the build, some tidying of wiring and fuel lines was done, along with improving some of the non-critical parts of the build like the bucket seat. Of course, adding pallet spoilers and body kit puts the finishing touches on the build and the go-kart is finally ready to tear up the local go-kart track and the less-inspiring Pinterest projects. [Garage Avenger] is no stranger to strange vehicle builds, either. Although its a bit out of season for most of our northern hemisphere readers now, his jet-powered street sled is still worth a view.\n\n", "title": "\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f4\u901f\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306e\u6728\u5de5\u8077\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u8da3\u5473\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u969b\u306e\u521d\u671f\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u6728\u6750\u3092\u8abf\u9054\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3002\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30014\u901f\u306e\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6539\u9020\u3002\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u88dc\u5f37\u3057\u3001\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f4\u901f\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u59cb\u3081\u308bDIY\uff1a\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6728\u6750\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8DIY\uff1a\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u92fc\u7ba1\u3067\u88dc\u5f37\uff1a\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "DIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u30d1\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

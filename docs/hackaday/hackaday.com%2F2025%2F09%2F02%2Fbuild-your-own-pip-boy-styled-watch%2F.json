Prefer to put your own spin on it, or feel inspired by the wrist-mounted enclosure? Hes thoughtfully provided the CAD files as well.\nInside the PIP-WATCH is a neat piece of hardware, the Lilygo T-Display-S3 Long. Its an ESP32-based board with a wide, touch-enabled, color 180 x 640 display attached. That makes it a perfect fit for a project like this, at least in theory. In practice, [Arnov] found the documentation extremely lacking which made the hardware difficult to use, but he provides code and instructions so theres no need to go through the same hassles he did.\nIn addition to the Hackaday.io project page, theres an Instructables walkthrough.\nIf you put your own spin on a Pip-boy (whether just a project inspired by one, or a no-detail-spared build of dizzying detail) we want to hear about it, so be sure to drop us a tip!\n\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305fPIP-WATCH\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u6700\u65b0\u306ePIP-WATCH\u306f\u3001Fallout\u306ePip-Boy\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806\u3084CAD\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305fPIP-WATCH\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u78c1\u77f3\u5f0f\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30d7\u4ed8\u304dPIP-WATCH\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- Lilygo T-Display-S3 Long\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u304c\u3061\u306a\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u88dc\u3046PIP-WATCH\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u6307\u793a", "- \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306ePip-boy\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01"]}

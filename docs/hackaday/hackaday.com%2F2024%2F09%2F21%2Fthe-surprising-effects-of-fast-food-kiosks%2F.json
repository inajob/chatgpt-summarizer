One of the latest incarnations of this phenomenon is the fast-food ordering kiosk. No longer will you have some teenager asking you if you want fries with that. These days, you are more likely going to find the question on a touch screen. So, are those poor kids out of an entry-level job? Apparently not, according to a recent CNN story.\nAccording to McDonalds, a business that embraces the kiosks, the new technology increases sales and creates more jobs, albeit more jobs further behind the counter. Part of the reason is that while Do you want fries with that is a cliche, it is also a sound business practice. Cashiers should try to upsell but dont always do so. The kiosk always remembers to offer you an apple pie or whatever else they want to move today.\n\nOf course, there are other new jobs. A decade ago, very few restaurants would deliver food to your car while you were parked. Now, thats practically a norm, and it requires humans for now. Of course, there are other studies that show people at kiosks with a line behind them tend to order less or have more trouble entering their order. But the consensus seems to be that it is generally a good thing and is leading to more jobs in the sector instead of less.\nWe like tech, of course. We cant help but wonder if this isnt a case where the computer isnt great, but it is better than what you are likely to get in real life. If you are feeling smug with your job at the grill, dont worry. The robots are coming for you next. What do you think? Are robots, AI, and tech taking jobs or making them?", "title": "\u9ad8\u901f\u98df\u54c1\u6ce8\u6587\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306e\u5265\u596a\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6a5f\u4f1a\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u98f2\u98df\u5e97\u306e\u6ce8\u6587\u7528\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u6025\u5897\u4e2d\u3002\u81ea\u52d5\u58f2\u4e0a\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u5275\u51fa\u306b\u5bc4\u4e0e\u3002\u30ec\u30b8\u4fc2\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u58f2\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u5897\u52a0\u306f\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u3082\u78ba\u8a8d\u3002\u5e97\u5185\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u4e8b\u5275\u51fa\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5c0e\u5165\u3067\u4ed5\u4e8b\u5909\u5316\u3001AI\u3084\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96c7\u7528\u5275\u51fa\u597d\u610f\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u901f\u98df\u54c1\u6ce8\u6587\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306e\u5265\u596a\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6a5f\u4f1a\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u4ed5\u4e8b\uff1a\u96c7\u7528\u3092\u5275\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\uff1a\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u3066\u58f2\u4e0a\u62e1\u5927", "\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u96c7\u7528\u6a5f\u4f1a", "\u4eba\u9593vs\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308b\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

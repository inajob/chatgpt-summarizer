The NSA wanted a computer to break codes, but in 1956, there wasnt much to pick from, especially since they wanted a very fast computer.\nAs you might expect from the name, a cryotron depends on superconductivity. The original device was a tantalum wire wrapped with a niobium wire coil. When the device is soaked in liquid helium, both wires become superconducting. The tantalum wire can carry way more current in that state unless the niobium coil generates a magnetic field, which kills the wires superconductivity. On the plus side, you have a relay-like switch that works with no moving parts. On the negative side, you need liquid helium.\n\nGeneral Electric produced one of the first integrated circuits containing a thin film cryotron, which was flat. While the switching was fast, it wasnt as fast as it could be, so marrying the cryotron with a Josephson junction improved the device to where it could switch at less than 800 picoseconds. That isnt all that remarkable today, but that was a technical feat in the 1950s and 1960s.\nIf you enjoy [Seans] talk, you might want to read the original paper from 1955 from [Dudley Buck]. Weve looked back at the device before (and you can still find the broken link). Turns out you can do a lot with a Josephson junction.\n"}

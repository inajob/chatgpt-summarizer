And were not saying its aliens either, mainly because wed never be lucky enough to be alive during an actual alien invasion  life just hasnt historically been that kind to us. So chances are overwhelming that 3I/Atlas is just a comet, but man, its doing its level best to look like its not, which means its time to brave the slings and arrows and wade into this subject.\nThe number of oddities surrounding 3I/Atlas just keeps growing, from its weird Sun-directed particle stream to its extreme speed, not to mention a trajectory through the solar system that puts it just a fraction of an astronomical unit from two of the three planets within the Goldilocks Zone of our star  ignore the fact that at an estimated seven billion years old, 3I/Atlas likely would have started its interstellar journey well before our solar system had even started forming. Still, its the trajectory that intrigues us, especially the fact that its coming in at a very shallow along to the ecliptic, and seems like it will cross that imaginary plane almost exactly when it makes its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, which just coincidentally happens to be at the very moment Earth is exactly on the opposite side of our star. Well be as far as possible from the action on that date, with the comet conveniently lost in the glare of the Sun. Yes, theres talk of re-tasking some of our spacecraft around Mars or in the Jovian system to take a peek when 3I/Atlas passes through their neighborhoods, but those are complicated affairs that show no sign of bearing fruit in the short time left before the comet heads back out into the Deep Dark. Too bad; wed really love an up-close and personal look at this thing.\n\nStarbucks campers, beware  the company would really prefer you dont set up a full office in their stores. At least in South Korea, that is, where patrons have taken things to extremes by bringing full-sized desktop computers and even printers to the cozy confines of their local Starbucks. The company is fighting back against the practice in the most generic way possible, implementing a policy that bans patrons from bringing bulky items with them when the caffeine urge strikes. Mind you, weve done plenty of work out in the wild. Nearly the whole first year of Hackaday articles from this particular author were written on a humble Chromebook inside either a Starbucks or a Dunkin  with heavy emphasis on the latter because of their vastly superior hot cocoa. So we get the new rule, but it almost seems like Starbucks is missing an opportunity here. Why dont they just lean into it and install a metered printer in each store?\nThis story gave us a bit of pause when we first read it, and were not sure if this is a case of technical ignorance on the part of the UK government, or us. Guidance published this week by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs asks UK citizens to delete old emails and images from cloud-based services due to the current nationally significant drought conditions. Apparently, this will save water somehow, presumably by reducing the cooling load on the data centers that house these files. If youre confused by this, we are too; do the policy wonks think that the hard drives that store these files are water-cooled? Or perhaps that keeping those pictures from 2013 requires some CPU cycles, therefore generating heat that has to be removed? We suppose thats possible, and that removing the temptation to gaze at photos from Aunt Winifreds 99th birthday party would spare a few drops of water, but then again, it was our impression that data centers arent just running cold water from the taps through their cooling units, but rather running closed-loop systems that consume as little fresh water as possible. Were willing to be proven wrong, of course  data center cooling actually sounds like great fodder for an article  but on the face of it, this sounds like a government agency throwing something against the wall and seeing if it sticks.\nWe cant say why for sure, but the idea of continental divides is unreasonably cool to us. Here in the US, weve got a couple of these imaginary geographic lines, the main one being the Atlantic-Pacific divide that roughly transects the continent north to south along the ridges and peaks of the Rocky Mountains. East of the line, water eventually flows into the Atlantic basin, while west of the line, rivers all flow into the Pacific. Its a fascinating concept, one thats captured beautifully by River Runner Global, an interactive GIS application that lets you trace the path of a virtual drop of water on its journey to the sea. It charts the rivers and streams of your drops journey, and the best part is the flyover of the terrain as it courses to the sea. Fair warning, its pretty resource hungry; it locked up our machine once while playing. But its worth the risk, in our opinion.\nAnd finally, its factory tour time again here at Hackaday Links, and this time weve got a real treat: a full tour of Toyota Motors Manufacturing Texas, the San Antonio mega-plant that makes Tundra pickups and Sequoia SUVs. The factory produces one new vehicle every 67 seconds, starting from raw steel coil stock. The enormity of the presses used to stamp out body panels alone is worth the price of admission, as is the part where the entire body goes for a deep soak in a galvanizing tank to protect the metal. The level of automation is astounding, but it was surprising to see just how many people are still critical to the process. And extra points for the sneak-peek at the new Tundra color near the end. Were not a fan, but it certainly does make a statement.

Thus, he built a toy to help educate a child about colors by pairing them with sounds, and Color Player was born.\nThe build is based around the TCS34725, an off-the-shelf color sensor. Its paired with an ESP32, which senses colors and then plays sounds in turn. [Deep Tronix] made this part harder by insisting on creating their own WAV playback system, using the microcontroller, an SD card, and its on-board digital-to-analog hardware.\nThe map of colors and sounds.\nThe toy operates in three primary modes. Color-to-tone, color-to-sound, color-to-voice. Basically, a color is scanned, and then the Color Player creates a tone, plays back a pre-recorded audio sample, or spells out the name of the color that was just scanned.\n[Deep Tronix] also included jolly mode, which just color cycles a few RGB LEDs. However, theres a game inside jolly mode as well, created for an older nephew to play with. Enter the right button combination, and you unlock it. Then, the device suggests a color and you have to run around, find it, and scan it to score.\nWe love a good color game; somehow this build seems even more compelling than Milton Bradleys classic Simon toy.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u300cColor Player\u300d", "body": "[Deep Tronix]\u306f\u3001\u8272\u3092\u97f3\u3067\u6559\u3048\u308b\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u300cColor Player\u300d\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u518d\u751f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u300cColor Player\u300d", "- ESP32\u3068TCS34725\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u97f3\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u8272\u3092\u97f3\u306b\u5909\u63db\uff013\u3064\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u300cColor Player\u300d", "- RGB LED\u3068\u9023\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u5b50\u4f9b\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u8272\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30c8\u30a4\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u8a18\u9332"]}

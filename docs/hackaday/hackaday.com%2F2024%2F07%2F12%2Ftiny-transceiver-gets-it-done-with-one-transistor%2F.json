Weve seen a lot of simple low-power receivers using a single transistor, and a fair number of one-transistor transmitters. But both in one package with only a single active component? Curiosity piqued.\nIt turns out that [Ciprian Popica (YO6DXE)]s design is exactly what it says on the label, and its pretty cool to boot. The design is an improvement on a one-transistor transceiver called El Pititico and is very petite indeed. The BOM has only about fifteen parts including a 2N2222 used as a crystal-controlled oscillator for both the transmitter and the direct-conversion receiver, along with a handful of passives and a coupe of hand-wound toroidal inductors. Theres no on-board audio section, so youll have to provide an external amplifier to hear the signals; some might say this is cheating a bit from the one transistor thing, but well allow it. Oh, and theres a catch  you have to learn Morse code, since this is a CW-only transmitter.\nAs for construction, [Ciprian] provides a nice PCB\u00a0 layout, but the video below seems to show a more traditional ugly style build, which we always appreciate. The board lives in a wooden box small enough to get lost in a pocket. The transceiver draws about 1.5 mA while receiving and puts out a fairly powerful 500 mW signal, which is fairly high in the QRP world. [Ciprian] reports having milked a full watt out of it with some modifications, but that kind of pushes the transistor into Magic Smoke territory. The signal is a bit chirpy, too, but not too bad.\nWe love minimalist builds like these; they always have us sizing up our junk bin and wishing we were better stocked on crystals and toroids. It might be good to actually buckle down and learn Morse too.\n\n\n\n", "title": "1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001YO6DXE\u6c0f\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u57fa\u677f\u306fPCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6642\u306b1.5mA\u3001\u9001\u4fe1\u6642\u306b500mW\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u51fa\u529b\u3002\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u307f\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3001\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u306f\u7c21\u7d20\u3002", "titles": ["1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3060\u3051\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30ed\u30fc\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3068\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u3068\u8a55\u4fa1"]}

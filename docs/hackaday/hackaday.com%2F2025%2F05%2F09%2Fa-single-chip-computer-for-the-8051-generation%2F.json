Its easy to understand and program, so it remains a fixture despite much faster replacements appearing.\nIf you cant find an original 40-pin DIP dont worry, because [mit41301] has produced a board in a compatible 40-pin format. Its called the single chip computer not because such a thing is a novelty in 2025, but because it has no need for the support chips which would have come with the original.\nThe modern 8051 clone in use is a CH558 or CH559, both chips with far more onboard than the original. The pins are brought out to one side only of the board, because on the original the other side would interface with an external RAM chip. It speaks serial, and can be used through either a USB-to-serial or Bluetooth-to-serial chip. Theres MCS-BASIC for it, so programming should be straightforward.\nWe can see the attraction of this board even though we reach for much more accomplished modern CPUs by choice. Several decades ago the original 8051 on Intel dev boards was our university teaching microcontoller, so there remains here a soft spot for it. We certainly see other 8051 designs, as for example this Arduino clone.", "title": "- 8051\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Intel 8051\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306f\u5ec3\u6b62\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u65b0\u898f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3082\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "titles": ["- 8051\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- CH558/CH559\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u6271\u3044\u3084\u3059\u30448051\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3", "- \u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u901a\u4fe1\u7528USB/Bluetooth\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f8051\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- MCS-BASIC\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a8051\u4e92\u63db\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u6614\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306e8051\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

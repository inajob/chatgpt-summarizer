[Void Computing] is writing an open source SDK for making use of AR glasses, and, along the way, theyve brought us two wonderful blog posts filled with technical information laid out in a fun to read way. The first article is titled AR glasses USB protocols: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and the second one follows as the Worse, the Better and the Prettier.\nHave you ever wanted to learn how AR glasses and similar devices work, whats their internal structure, which ones are designed well and which ones maybe not so much? These two posts have concise explanations, more than plenty of diagrams, six case studies of different pairs of AR glasses on the market, each pair demonstrated by our hackers canine assistant.\n[Void Computing] goes in-depth on this tech  you will witness MCU firmware reverse-engineering, HID packet captures, a quick refresher on the USB-C DisplayPort altmode, hexdumps aplenty, and a reminder on often forgotten tools of the trade like Cunninghams law.\nIf reverse-engineering lights your fire, these high-level retrospectives will teach you viable ways to reverse-engineer devices in your own life, and they certainly set a high bar for posts as far as write-ups go. Having read through these posts, one cant help but think that some sort of AR glasses protocol standard is called for here, but fortunately, it appears like [Void Computing]s SDK is the next best thing, and their mission to seize the good aspects of a tentative cyberpunk future is looking to be a success. Weve started talking about AR glasses over a decade ago, and its reassuring to see hackers catching up on this technologys advancements.\nWe thank [adistuder] for sharing this with us on the Hackaday Discord server!", "title": "AR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068USB\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u89e3\u6790\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "body": "AR\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068AR\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002[Void Computing]\u304cAR\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9SDK\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001\u6280\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u697d\u3057\u304f\u8aac\u660e\u3002\u9006\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3084AR\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306b\u8ffd\u3044\u3064\u304f\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002", "titles": ["AR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068USB\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u89e3\u6790\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "AR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3068SDK\u958b\u767a", "AR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u8a55\u4fa1\u3068\u5e02\u5834\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5206\u6790", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308bAR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u6280\u8853\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\u3068\u672a\u6765\u5c55\u671b", "[Void Computing]\u306b\u3088\u308bAR\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u95a2\u9023\u6280\u8853\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316"]}

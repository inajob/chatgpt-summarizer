In the worst cases they can get fussy about things like the shade of brown a homeowner can paint their mailbox post, so you can imagine the problems theyd have with things like ham radio antennas. [Bob] aka [KD4BMG] has been working on tuning up his rain gutters to use as stealth antennas to avoid any conflicts with his HOA.\nWith the right antenna tuner, essentially any piece of metal can be connected to a radio and used as an antenna. There are a few things that improve that antennas performance, though. [Bob] already has an inconspicuous coax connector mounted on the outside of his house with an antenna tuner that normally runs his end-fed sloper antenna, which also looks like it includes a fairly robust ground wire running around his home. All of this is coincidentally located right beside a metal downspout, so all this took to start making contacts was to run a short wire from the tuner to the gutter system.\nWith the tuner doing a bit of work, [Bob] was able to make plenty of contacts from 10 to 80 meters, with most of the contacts in the 20  30 meter bands. Although the FCC in the US technically forbids HOAs from restricting reasonable antennas, if youd rather not get on the bad side of your least favorite neighbors there are a few other projects from [Bob] to hide your gear.\n\n", "title": "HOA\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96e8\u6a0b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "body": "\u7c73\u56fd\u3092\u542b\u3080\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u56fd\u3067\u306f\u3001\u4f4f\u5b85\u6240\u6709\u8005\u5354\u4f1a\uff08HOA\uff09\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u4e0d\u52d5\u7523\u5229\u7528\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u9055\u53cd\u884c\u70ba\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7de0\u307e\u308a\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002[Bob]\u306f\u96e8\u6a0b\u3092\u30b9\u30c6\u30eb\u30b9\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7814\u7a76\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u6210\u529f\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["HOA\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96e8\u6a0b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u30ba\u5354\u4f1a\u306b\u982d\u3092\u60a9\u307e\u305b\u305a\u306b\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5730\u5473\u306a\u96e8\u6a0b\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96a0\u5bc6\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u96a0\u3057\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "HOA\u3068\u306e\u845b\u85e4\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u96e8\u6a0b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca"]}

[Dakkaron] has attached a BlackBerry keyboard to a slightly more recent device.\nDesigned for the FairPhone 4, [Dakkaron]s hack should be transferable to other smartphones as it connects to the phone over USB without any of that tedious mucking about with Bluetooth. Theres even a handy OpenSCAD-based generator to help you along in the customization process.\n[Dakkaron] started with an Arduino Pro Micro-based implementation, but the most recent iteration uses a custom board that can be obtained partially-populated. Unfortunately, the Hirose connector for the keyboard isnt available off-the-shelf, so youll have to solder that yourself if youre planning to do this mod. Sounds like a perfect opportunity to practice your surface mount soldering skills!\nIf the Q10 keyboard looks familiar, its probably because its one of the most popular keyboards for small projects around here.

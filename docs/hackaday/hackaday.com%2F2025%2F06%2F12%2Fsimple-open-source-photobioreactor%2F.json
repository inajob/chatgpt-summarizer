Is it? Since it is the only photobioreactor we are aware of, well assume that it is. According to the post, other designs are either difficult to recreate since they require PC boards, sensors, and significant coding.\nThis project uses no microcontroller, so it has no coding. It also has no sensors. The device is essentially an acrylic tube with an air pump and some LEDs.\n\nThe base is 3D printed and contains very limited electronics. In addition to the normal construction, apparently, the cylinder has to be very clean before you introduce the bioreactant.\nOf course, you also need something to bioreact, if thats even a real word. The biomass of choice in this case was Scenedesmus algae. While photobioreactors are used in commercial settings where you need to grow something that requires light, like algae, this one appears to mostly be for decorative purposes. Sort of an aquarium for algae. Then again, maybe someone has some use for this. If thats you, let us know what your plans are in the comments.\nWeve seen a lantern repurposed into a bioreactor. It doesnt really have the photo part, but weve seen a homebrew bioreactor for making penicillin.\n", "title": "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5149\u5408\u6210\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u306f\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u7ba1\u3068LED\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3068LED\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u6c34\u69fd\uff1a\u88c5\u98fe\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b"]}

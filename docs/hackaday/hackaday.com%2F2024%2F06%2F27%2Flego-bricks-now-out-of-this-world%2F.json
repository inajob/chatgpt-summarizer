One such challenge relates to how any proposed Moon base might be built, and as European Space Agency (ESA) researchers turn their mind to the problem theyve taken a uniquely European approach. Theyve made some LEGO bricks.\nSadly lunar regolith is in short supply in Europe at the moment, so as a stand-in theyve ground up a meteorite, mixed the powder with a polymer, and 3D printed their bricks. The LEGO write-up is a little long on frothy writing style and a little short on the science, but it seems that they clutch in exactly the same way as the official bricks from Billund, and can be assembled just as you would a normal set of bricks.\nIts with some regret that we have to concede that Europes off-planet outpost wont be crewed by LEGO people in a base made from LEGO bricks, but we applaud them for doing this as a practical test given the limited supply of starter material. LEGO themselves have snagged some of them to display in a range of their flagship stores, so we hot-footed it down to London to catch some pictures. What we found is a single brick in a glass case, sadly looking very like any other 3D printed brick in a shiny grey medium. Its probably the most expensive brick in the world though, so we doubt theyll be available to buy any time soon.\nIf youre hungry for more of all things LEGO, we can do no better than suggest a trip to the mother lode, in Billund, Denmark.", "title": "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u6b27\u5dde\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2\uff08ESA\uff09\u306eLEGO\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u8a08\u753b", "body": "\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2\uff08ESA\uff09\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u3001\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u5efa\u8a2d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5c0f\u60d1\u661f\u306e\u7c89\u672b\u3068\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u3067LEGO\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u8cc7\u6e90\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u3001\u672c\u7269\u306eLEGO\u4eba\u5f62\u3067\u57fa\u5730\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u8996\u91ce\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u6b27\u5dde\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2\uff08ESA\uff09\u306eLEGO\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u8a08\u753b", "\u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c 3D \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u306e\u30ec\u30b4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u6b27\u5dde\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2 (ESA)\u3001\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u306e\u30ec\u30b4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u6b27\u5dde\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3001\u30e1\u30c6\u30aa\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u88fd\u9020", "\u30ec\u30b4\u672c\u793e\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u306b\u5c55\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3001\u6b27\u5dde\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u95a2\u306e\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u30ec\u30b4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af"]}

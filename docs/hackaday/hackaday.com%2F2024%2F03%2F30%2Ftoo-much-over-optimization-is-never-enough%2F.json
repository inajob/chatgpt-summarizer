These handy devices often take the shape of an IC, SMD or otherwise, but between the pins are a bunch of resistors instead of active silicon. They come in all sorts of configurations and tolerances, but the point is usually the same: When you need a bunch of similar resistors, it\u2019s cheaper to go with a network package.\nBut how much cheaper? I did a quick search for 1 k\u03a9 resistors and the corresponding network, and came up with similar prices for the resistors and networks \u2013 but the network has eight resistors in it! That\u2019s an eightfold savings! Which, at a price of roughly one cent per piece, is less than a dime. While it\u2019s certainly true that if you\u2019re making a million widgets, saving a penny per widget matters. But do you spend the time to optimize your projects down to such margins? I want to say \u201cof course not!\u201d but maybe you do?\nFor me, worrying about seven cents in a PCB design that I may make ten of is foolishness. But still, I\u2019ve used resistor networks for their other side effects: the resistors in a common package tend to be very tightly matched, even if their overall tolerance isn\u2019t. If you\u2019re making something like an R-2R DAC, that\u2019s a definite advantage. Or if you\u2019re space constrained, or just hate placing lots of tiny resistors, the networks shine.\nI often forget about resistor networks, and when I do think of them, I think of them in terms of cost savings in industrial applications. But maybe that\u2019s not fair \u2013 maybe they do have their hacker uses as well. Are there other parts like this that we should all know about?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

It offered motion-controlled bowling, some basic internet features, and a pretty decent\u00a0Zelda game. On top of all that, though, you could also use it to order a pizza, as [Retro Game Attic] demonstrates.\nThe Wii used to organize different features of the console into channels. Way back in the day, you could install the Demae Channel on your Wii in Japan, which would let you order fast food from various outlets using the Demaecan service.\nThe Demae Channel service was discontinued in 2017. However, it has since been resurrected by WiiLink, which is a homebrew project which replicates the functionality of the original Nintendo WiiConnect 24 and Wi-Fi Connection servers. As it stands, you can load the WiiLink version of the Demae Channel (or Food Channel) on to your Wii, and use it to order pizza from your local Dominos Pizza. It only works in the United States and Canada right now, and there are no other restaurants available, at least until further development is completed to add JustEat compatibility. Its not entirely clear how much of the functionality was recreated from the original Demae Channel; what is clear is that plenty of custom development has been done on the WiiLink version to integrate it with modern delivery services.\nWhats so exciting about this is how well it actually works. The app perfectly nails the classic Wii Channel visual style. It also seems to integrate well with the Dominos API for digital orders, even displaying simple updates on holiday opening hours and order times. Pricing data and images of the pizzas are all available right in the app, and you can even make modifications. It might be a gimmick but it actually works. Notably, though, the app avoids any stickiness with handling payment\u2014thankfully, pay-on-delivery is still legitimate in the pizza world in 2026.\nWill this revolutionize how you order pizza on a daily basis? Probably not. Is it one of the coolest Wii hacks weve seen in a while? Undeniably. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u3067\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6ce8\u6587\uff01Demae Channel\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "\u4efb\u5929\u5802Wii\u3067\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6ce8\u6587\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u5b85\u914d\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u3067\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6ce8\u6587\uff01Demae Channel\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "WiiLink\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30d4\u30b6\u6ce8\u6587\u4f53\u9a13", "2006\u5e74\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u304c\u4eca\u3082\u9032\u5316\u4e2d\uff01Wii\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wii\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u6a5f\u80fd"]}

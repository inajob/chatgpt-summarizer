But what if you want to take a couple lunch loops on your bike and only need 20 minutes of charge? Thats [Seth] from Berm Peak set out to find out with his minuscule Bermacell battery.\nThe battery is made from only 14 18650s, this tiny 52V batty is nearly as small an e-bike battery as can be made. Each cell is 3000 mAh making a total battery capacity of 156 Wh. All the cells were welded in series with an off the shelf BMS and everything was neatly packaged in an over-sized 3D printed 9V battery case. [Seth] plans to make another smaller battery with less then 100 Wh of capacity so he can take it on a plane, so stay tuned for more coverage!\n\n[Seth] hooked up the Bermacell to the Bimotal e-bike conversion system on his trail bike and hit Kanuga bike park. He got three laps out of the Bermacell, and thinks a fourth is possible with more conservative throttle usage. The three laps equates to about 1500 ft of total elevation gain, a metric commonly used by mountain bikers. For a more useful metric for commuters, [Seth] recharged the battery and rode to a nearby coffee shop and back, a distance of nearly 13 miles with pedaling and throttle assist.\nThis is not the first time we have seen [Seth] hacking on e-bikes. Make sure to check out our coverage of his jailbreak of a pay to ride e-bike.\u00a0\n\n", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01Bermacell\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Seth\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u300120\u5206\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3093\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01Bermacell\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u305f\u3063\u305f14\u500b\u306e18650\u30bb\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1aBermacell\u3067\u306e\u8a66\u904b\u8ee2\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30bb\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u79d8\u8a23"]}

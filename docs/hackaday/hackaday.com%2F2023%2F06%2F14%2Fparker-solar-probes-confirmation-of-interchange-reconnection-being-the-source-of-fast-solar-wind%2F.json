(Credit: NASA)\nAlthough experimental verification is at the heart of the scientific method, there is quite a difficulty range when it comes to setting up such an experiment. Testing what underlies the formation of the fast solar winds that are ejected from coronal holes in the Suns corona is one of these tricky experimental setups. Yet it would seem that we now have our answer, with a newly published paper in\u00a0Nature\u00a0by S. D. Bale and colleagues detailing what we learned courtesy of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), which has been on its way to the Sun since it was launched in August of 2018 from Earth.\nThe Suns solar wind is the name for a stream of charged particles which are ejected from the Suns corona, with generally two types being distinguished: slow and fast solar winds. The former type appears to originate from the Suns equatorial belt and gently saunters away from the Sun at a mere 300  500 km/s with a balmy temperature of 100 MK. The fast solar wind originates from coronal holes, which are temporary regions of cooler, less dense plasma within the corona. These coronal holes are notable for being regions where the Suns magnetic field extends into interplanetary space as an open field, along which the charged particles of the corona can escape the Suns gravitational field.\nThese properties of coronal holes allow the resulting stream to travel at speeds around 750 km/s and a blistering 800 MK. What was unclear up till this point was exactly what powers the acceleration of the plasma. It was postulated that the source could be wave heating, as well as interchange reconnection, but with the PSP now close enough to perform the relevant measurements, the evidence points to the latter.\nEssentially, interchange reconnection is the reestablishing of a coronal holes field lines after interaction with convection cells on the Suns photosphere. These convection cells draw the magnetic field into a kind of funnel after which the field lines reestablish themselves, which results in the ejection of hotter plasma than with the slow solar wind. Courtesy of the PSPs measurements, measured fast solar winds could be matched with coronal holes, along with the magnetic fields. This gives us the clearest picture yet of how this phenomenon works, and how we might be able to predict it.\n(Heading image: Diagram of the Sun.

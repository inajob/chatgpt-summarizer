That\u2019s the curious promise of a new paper from CHI 2025, which brings a serious hacker vibe to the sustainability problem of multi-material 3D printing. Titled Enabling Recycling of Multi-Material 3D Printed Objects through Computational Design and Disassembly by Dissolution, it proposes a technique that lets complex prints disassemble themselves via water-soluble seams. Just a bit of H2O is needed, no drills or pliers.\nAt its core, this method builds dissolvable interfaces between materials like PLA and TPU using water-soluble PVA. Their algorithm auto-generates jointed seams (think shrink-wrap meets mushroom pegs) that don\u2019t interfere with the parts function. Once printed, the object behaves like any ordinary 3D creation. But at end-of-life, a water bath breaks it down into clean, separable materials, ready for recycling. That gives 90% material recovery, and over 50% reduction in carbon emissions.\nThis is the research  call it a very, very well documented hack  we need more of. Its climate-conscious and machine-savvy. If you\u2019re into computational fabrication or environmental tinkering, it\u2019s worth your time. Hats off to [Wen, Bae, and Rivera] for turning what might otherwise be considered a failure into a feature.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5df1\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u6c34\u6eb6\u6027\u306e\u63a5\u5408\u90e8\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5206\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5df1\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\uff01\u6c34\u6eb6\u6027\u30b7\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u9769\u547d\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5206\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u8907\u5408\u6750\u6599\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306790%\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u56de\u53ce\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3088\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u914d\u616e"]}

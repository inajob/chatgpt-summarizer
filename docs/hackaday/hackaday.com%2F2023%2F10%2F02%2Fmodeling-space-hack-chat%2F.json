To further push out that branch, well further guess that some of those models included spacecraft, both real and imaginary. And with good reason  you dont get to space without some interesting engineering, a lot of which is reflected in the design of the vehicles intended to get there. Rockets are cool, satellites are cooler still, and if you cant actually go to space yourself, or at least be the person building the actual hardware, at least you can build a model and dare to dream.\nBut while a model on a stand or hanging from the ceiling on fishing line can certainly stimulate the imagination, wouldnt it be better if a model did something? Bryan Murphy and Sam Treadgold think so, which is why theyve been working on the ISS Mimic, which we recently featured. The 3D-printed 1:100 scale model of the International Space Station is equipped with servos that move the stations solar panels in real-time based on publically available telemetry. Its way more engaging than a static model, especially for kids just getting into STEM and related fields.\nBryan and Sam will stop by the Hack Chat to talk not just about the ISS Mimic, but about everything that has to do with modeling space. Who wouldnt love a desktop version of a Martian or lunar rover keeping pace with its full-scale counterpart? And wouldnt it be great to be able to visualize just how far away Voyager is right now? If its out there, we should be able to bring it home, at least in model form.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, October 4 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.", "title": "\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff01ISS\u30df\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30af", "body": "10\u67084\u65e5\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306bBryan Murphy\u3068Sam Treadgold\u304c\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306eISS Mimic\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5b9f\u7269\u5927\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u9858\u671b\u3082\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6642\u9593\u5e2f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u306a\u5909\u63db\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff01ISS\u30df\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30af", "\u5b87\u5b99\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3078\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d\uff01Bryan Murphy\u3068Sam Treadgold\u3068\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8", "\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u5b87\u5b99\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01ISS\u30df\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "\u5b87\u5b99\u63a2\u67fb\u3092\u5bb6\u5ead\u3067\u4f53\u611f\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u5b87\u5b99\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5f62\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u5b87\u5b99\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3078\u306e\u5165\u9580\u66f8\uff01\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u5b66\u3076"]}

Want to know what they were talking about? Listen in below and find out!\nIn an unusual twist, a listener sent in the sound for this weeks Whats This Sound competition, so it turns out Elliot and Al were both stumped for a change. See if you can do better, and you might just score a Hackaday Podcast T-shirt.\nOn the hacking front, the guys talked about what they hope to see as entries in the pet hacking contest, quantum diamonds (no kidding), spectrometers, and several science projects.\nThere was talk of a tiny robot, a space mouse\u2014the computer kind, not a flying rodent\u2014and even an old-fashioned photophone that let Alexander Graham Bell use the sun like a string on a paper cup telephone.\nThings really heat up at the end, when there is talk about computer programming ranging from COBOL to Vibe programming. In case youve missed it, vibe coding is basically delegating your work to the AI, but do you really want to? Maybe, if your job is to convert all that old COBOL code.\nWant to read along? The links are below. Be sure to leave your robot plans, COBOL war stories, and AI-generated Vibe limerics in the comments!\n\nAs always, the human-generated Hackaday Podcast is available as a DRM-free MP3 download.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 317 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nAnnouncing The Hackaday Pet Hacks Contest\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nWant to win a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt?

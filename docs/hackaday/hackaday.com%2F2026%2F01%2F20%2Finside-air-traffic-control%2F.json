Depending on the movie, they might realize theyve picked the wrong week to stop some bad habit. But how does the system really work? [J. B. Crawford] has a meticulously detailed post about the origins of the computerized air traffic control system (building on an earlier post which is also interesting).\nLike many early computer systems, the FAA started out with the Air Force SAGE defense system. It makes sense. SAGE had to identify and track radar targets. The 1959 SATIN (SAGE Air Traffic Integration) program was the result. Meanwhile, different parts of the air traffic system were installing computers piecemeal.\nSAGE and its successors had many parents: MIT, MITRE, RAND, and IBM. When it was time to put together a single national air traffic system the FAA went straight to IBM, who glued together a handful of System 360 computers to form the IBM 9020. The computers had a common memory bus and formed redundant sets of computer elements to process the tremendous amount of data fed to the system. The shared memory devices were practically computers in their own right. Each main computing element had a private area of memory but could also allocate in the large shared pool.\nThe 9200 ran the skies for quite a while until IBM replaced it with the IBM 3083. The software was mostly the same, as were the display units. But the computer hardware, unsurprisingly, received many updates.\nIf youre thinking that theres no need to read the original post now that youve got the highlights from us, wed urge you to click the link anyway. The post has a tremendous amount of detail and research. Weve only scratched the surface.\nThere were earlier control systems, some with groovy light pens. These days, the control tower might be in the cloud.", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8d77\u6e90", "body": "\u822a\u7a7a\u7ba1\u5236\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\u9032\u5316\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u8ff0\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8d77\u6e90", "- SAGE\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u308b\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- IBM\u304c\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u521d\u306e\u5168\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u5316\u3059\u308b\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u822a\u7a7a\u7ba1\u5236\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

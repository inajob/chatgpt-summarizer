Drilling a hole into the enclosure would be an option, but decided a touch sensor on the top of the enclosure would be much more elegant  not to mention better at keeping dirt and moisture out. To bridge the 6.3 mm spacing between the PCB and the top of the enclosure [Daniel] used a small, 7 mm PCB-mounted spring.\nThe spring used to create a capacitive touch sensor. (Source: JLCPCB parts)\nAlthough capacitive sensing works with just about\u00a0 anything thats electrically conductive, its important to get the conductive element as close to the users digits as possible. Using a spring here has the advantage that when the enclosure is closed up, the lid will push down onto the spring, which will not only compress slightly, but also provide the best capacitive sensing experience when e.g. the enclosure flexes or warps over time on account of always being pressed against the inside of the lid.\nWhile hardly world-changing, this is another neat design tip when youre looking to turn more surfaces into touch controls. Just keep in mind that capacitive sensing is notoriously fussy and any trace and spring are also excellent antennae for stray EMI. Nobody likes random capacitive button inputs, after all."}

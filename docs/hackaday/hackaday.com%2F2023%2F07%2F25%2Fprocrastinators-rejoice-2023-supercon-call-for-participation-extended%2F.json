Who are we to say \u201cno\u201d to potential presenters? We want to see all the ideas!\nWe\u2019re officially extending the Call for Speakers and the Call for Workshops for another week. Get your outline in before Aug.\u00a01st at 9:00 AM PDT, and it\u2019ll be in the selection for Supercon. (And no, we\u2019re not going to extend it twice!)\nThe Hackaday Superconference is really and truly our favorite event of the year. It\u2019s small, but not too small. The ideas everyone brings with them, however, are big. It\u2019s like the absolute best of Hackaday live and in person. If you\u2019re looking for a place to give a technical talk, or just to regale us all with the trials and triumphs of hacking, you won\u2019t find a more receptive audience anywhere. Plus, presenters get in free.\nBehind the scenes, we\u2019re still working on the badge, but we\u2019ve got many of the details fully hammered down. Expect tickets to go on sale in the second week of August \u2013 early bird tickets sell out fast. Keep your eyes on Hackaday for the announcement post when it goes live.\nWe know that November seems a long way out, but we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you all already. Hooray for Supercon!"}

The prolific experimenter had spent over a decade on YouTube, creating more than 2,500 videos where he gleefully demonstrated his seemingly endless collection of homemade contraptions. At least eighteen of which ended up on the pages of Hackaday since we first crossed paths with him back in 2013.\nLike many of you, we were also shocked to find that Robert made the decision to end his own life. As clich\u00e9 as it might sound, he simply didnt seem like the type. His demeanor was always boisterous in his videos, exhibiting an almost child-like joy as he showed off his latest creation with a laugh and smile.\nBut as explained by his brother Dave in the brief announcement video posted yesterday, his outward appearance was a well-rehearsed mask that covered a deepening depression. Regular viewers of Roberts videos knew he lost his wife, as he shared a memorial video for her in April of 2024. What he was less open about with his viewers was his own health, which it turns out had been rapidly declining for the last few months.\nWe now know that simply getting up and walking around had become painful for Robert, a fact obscured by the fact that most of his videos saw him seated at his workbench or in the back garden. That he was able to continue making so many videos at all speaks not only to his passion for technology and engineering, but the great love he had for the community that hed built.\nFrom the video we also learned that Robert found it very difficult to discuss his declining mental and physical health with friends and family. For men of his generation, the strong and silent type was often the ideal. Given all that he was going through, nobody could fault him for experiencing a sense of hopelessness, and yet his brother explains that Robert would never admit to the difficulties he was facing. Whenever pushed to talk about his feelings, hed respond with that phrase which weve all heard (and maybe used once or twice)  Im fine.\nBecause of this, Roberts family has partnered with the suicide prevention charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) to try and raise awareness about mens mental health. They ask that anyone who wishes to honor Robert make a donation to CALM, in the hopes that they can help others who may find themselves in a similar situation.\nIts no great secret that many in the hacker and maker communities face their own daily struggles. Whether its from being neurodivergent, or the inability to fit in with mainstream society. Several of the staff here at Hackaday are from marginalized groups, and even among those who arent, lets just say we have it on good authority that most of them didnt get to sit with the cool kids back in high school. We also know that, just like Robert, many in the community find it difficult to communicate with others about how this impacts their mental health.\nThe lasting legacy of Robert Murray-Smith will of course be his incredible body of work, which will continue to inspire millions of viewers. But we can also honor him by making sure that were looking out for the well-being of friends, family, and even ourselves. There are resources available, and theres no shame in asking for help when you need it.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30ec\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u6c0f\u306e\u8a03\u5831\u3068\u5f7c\u306e\u529f\u7e3e", "body": "\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u6c0f\u306e\u6b7b\u304c\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7cbe\u795e\u5065\u5eb7\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u304c\u5f37\u8abf\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30ec\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u6c0f\u306e\u8a03\u5831\u3068\u5f7c\u306e\u529f\u7e3e", "- \u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30d8\u30eb\u30b9\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2", "- \u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u907a\u7523\uff1a2,500\u672c\u306eDIY\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u7537\u6027\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30d8\u30eb\u30b9\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5bc4\u4ed8\u306e\u304a\u9858\u3044", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u52c7\u6c17"]}

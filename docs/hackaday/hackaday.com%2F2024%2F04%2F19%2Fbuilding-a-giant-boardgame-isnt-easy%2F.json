He had to prototype, design, and build a board game. A software-controlled board game, that is, and one that was 400 square-feet in size. As you might imagine, this ended up being a tall order, and hes been kind enough to share his tale on his blog.\nHis clients idea was for a giant interactive game board akin to the glowing disco floors of old. It had to play a game approximating the rules of The Floor Is Lava. It had to handle up to 20 players at a time, too.\n[Stevenson] runs a company that delivers Activations\u2014basically big showpieces for customers willing to pay. This wasnt his first attempt at building an immersive attraction, but it was a big job, and a challenging one at that. He explains the difficulties that came about from a limited crew, limited timeline, and a number of difficult missteps. Hurdles included surprise unusable off-the-shelf hardware and the difficulty of hand-sanding 144 tiles of polycarbonate.\u00a0One weeps for the projects plight early on  if only the AliExpress tiles were documented.\nHe may have bitten off more than he could chew, and yet\u2014the project was finished and to a decent degree of functionality success. Thats to be applauded, and [Stevenson] learned a ton along the way. Big projects can be daunting and can put you in a bind. As this story demonstrates, though, perseverance often gets you somewhere okay in the end. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "Stevenson Streeper\u306f\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3001\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u5b8c\u4e86\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u624b\u9593\u6687\u304b\u304b\u308b\u4f5c\u696d\u3084\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5b66\u3093\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a400\u5e73\u65b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u6311\u6226\u7684\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\uff1a20\u4eba\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u5de8\u5927\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u6210\u529f\u3078\u306e\u9053\uff1a\u96e3\u984c\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

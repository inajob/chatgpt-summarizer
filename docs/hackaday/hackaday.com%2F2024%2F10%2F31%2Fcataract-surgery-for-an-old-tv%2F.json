[bandersentv] found one of these ancient sets, but found it had a cataract\u2014a large ugly discoloration on the tube. He set about repairing the tube and the set, restoring this grand old piece back to working order.\nThe video begins with the removal of the round CRT tube. Once its extracted from the set, its placed in a round garbage can which serves as a handy work stand for the unique device. Its all delicate work as its very easy to damage a picture tube, particularly an old one. Removing the discoloration is quite a job\u2014the problem is caused by adhesive holding the front layer safety glass on, which has going bad over the years. It requires lots of heat to remove. In doing this repair, [bandersentv] notes hes also giving up the safety of the original extra glass layer on the front of the tube. Worth noting if youre worried about a given tubes integrity.\nOf course, cleaning the tube is just part of the job. [bandersentv] then gave us a second video in which he returns the tube to its original home and gets the TV back up and running. The quality is surprisingly good given what poor shape the tube was in to begin with.\nIts funny, because modern TV repair is altogether a rather different affair. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b: GE M935AWL\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u5186\u5f62\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3002\u753b\u9762\u306e\u5909\u8272\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9\u3057\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b: GE M935AWL\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- CRT\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u624b\u9806", "- \u80cc\u666f\u306b\u96a0\u308c\u305f\u554f\u984c: \u30ab\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u5168\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u5916\u3057\u3066\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3068\u5931\u3046\u3082\u306e", "- \u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u9b45\u529b: \u4fee\u7406\u5f8c\u306e\u753b\u8cea\u3068\u611f\u52d5"]}

Fortunately, [tinyboatproductions] has gotten into air quality lately and is here to help you with their snappy 3D printed air-filtering design.\nAt the heart of this build is a 120 mm notoriously-quiet Noctua fan coupled with a carbon filter. It does what youd think  position the fan the right way and it sucks the air through the filter, which catches all those nasty particles.\nThe only problem is that the Noctua uses PWM, so theres no governing it with a just potentiometer. To get around this, [tinyboatproductions] introduced an Arduino Nano and a buck converter, both of which were admittedly a bit overkill. Now the speed can be controlled with a pot.\nOnce control of the fan was sorted, [tinyboatproductions] decide to add an OLED display to show the fan speed and power condition, which is a nice touch. Be sure to check out the build video after the break.\nIf this doesnt have quite enough features for you, heres one thats battery powered.\n\n"}

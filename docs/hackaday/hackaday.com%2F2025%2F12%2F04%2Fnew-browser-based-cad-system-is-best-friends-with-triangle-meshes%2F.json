How about one that has no topological naming problem, a web-native parametric CAD front end to play with, and has CAD-type operations making friends with triangle meshes? If youre intrigued, check out [mmiscool]s BREP project.\nFunctioning (let alone feature-filled, or efficient) CAD systems are not a software project we see a whole lot of. Ones that represent models as genuine BREP structures but cleverly use mesh-based operations where it makes sense? Even less so.\nIn theory, CAD programs are simple: allow a user to define features, keep track of what they are and how they relate to one another, and perform operations on them as requested. In practice, its significant work. Chains of operations and dependencies easily become complex, volatile things and there is really no room for error.\nRead [Arya Voronova]s best practices for using FreeCAD to get a few hints as to what goes on behind the scenes in a modern CAD program, and the kinds of challenges the back end has to deal with, like the topological naming problem (TNP). A problem [mmiscool]s implementation completely avoids, by the way.\nThere is a live demo at BREP.io which acts as a playground for the state of the project. You can get started by clicking the + button towards the top on the left panel to add features and operations to the history (like add a cube, then add chamfers or fillets, or extrude a face, and so on).\n[mmiscool] points out that all computation is done client-side; even complex operations like fillets, lofts, and multi-body booleans execute directly in the browser with no need to be offloaded to a back end. BREPs development is being documented on Hackaday.io and there is a video embedded below that gives an overview. Why dont you give it a spin?\n\n", "title": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5883\u754c\u8868\u73fe\uff08BREP\uff09\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044BREP\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30c8\u30dd\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u306eCAD\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5883\u754c\u8868\u73fe\uff08BREP\uff09\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u30c8\u30dd\u30ed\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a", "BREP.io\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u306eCAD\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aCAD\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "FreeCAD\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u3068\u6311\u6226"]}

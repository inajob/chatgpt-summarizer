A tabletop Dobsonian might cost a few hundred dollars, and that is just the entry point for an ever-increasing set of telescopes, mounts, trackers, lasers, and other pieces of equipment that its possible to build or buy. [Thomas] is deep into astronomy now, has a high-quality, remotely controllable telescope, and wanted to make it more accessible to his friends and others, so he built a system that lets the telescope stream on Twitch and lets his Twitch viewers control what its looking at.\nThe project began with overcoming the $4000 telescopes practical limitations, most notably an annoyingly short Wi-Fi range and closed software. [Thomas] built a wireless bridge with a Raspberry Pi to extend connectivity, and then built a headless streaming system using OBS Studio inside a Proxmox container. This was a major hurdle as OBS doesnt have particularly good support for headless operation.\n\nThe next step was reverse engineering the proprietary software the telescope uses for control. [Thomas] was able to probe network traffic on the Android app and uncovered undocumented REST and WebSocket APIs. From there, he gained full control over targeting, parking, initialization, and image capture. This allowed him to automate telescope behavior through Python scripts rather than relying on the official Android app.\nTo make the telescope interactive, he built a Twitch-integrated control system that enables viewers to vote on celestial targets, issue commands, and view live telemetry, including stacking progress, exposure data, and target coordinates. A custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript overlay displays real-time status, and theres a custom loading screen when the telescope is moving to a new target. He also added ambient music and atmospheric effects, so the stream isnt silent.\nIf [Thomas]s stream is your first entry point into astronomy and you find that you need to explore it more on your own, there are plenty of paths to build your way into the hobby, especially with Dobsonian telescopes, which can be built by hand, including the mirrors.", "title": "\u30c6\u30ec\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092Twitch\u3067\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u306f\u9ad8\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u304c\u3001Thomas\u306f\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3092Twitch\u3067\u914d\u4fe1\u3057\u3001\u8996\u8074\u8005\u304c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30ec\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092Twitch\u3067\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306eWi-Fi\u63a5\u7d9a\u62e1\u5f35", "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u3078\u306e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b69\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306eDobsonian\u671b\u9060\u93e1", "Python\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u8996\u8074\u8005\u53c2\u52a0\u578b\u306e\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c\uff1aTwitch\u3067\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u4f53\u9a13"]}

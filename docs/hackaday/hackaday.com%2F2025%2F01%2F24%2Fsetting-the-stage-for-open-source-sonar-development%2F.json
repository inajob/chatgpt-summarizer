Whether its hardware or software \u00a0 if theres some megacorp out there trying to sell you something, you should have the option to go with a comparable open source version. Even if the commercial offering is objectively superior, its important that open source alternatives always exist, or else its the users themselves that end up becoming the product before too long.\nSo we were particularly excited when [Neumi] wrote in to share his Open Echo project, as it contains some very impressive work towards democratizing the use of sonar. Over the years weve seen a handful of underwater projects utilize sonar in some form or another, but they have always simply read the data from a commercial, and generally expensive, unit. But Open Echo promises to delete the middle-man, allowing for cheaper and more flexible access to bathymetric data.\n\nThe TUSS4470 Shield lets you experiment with driving transducers.\nThe project started with the reverse engineering of a cheap commercial fish finder, which gave [Neumi] first-hand experience with driving ultrasonic transducers and interpreting the signal they return. Further research lead him to the Texas Instruments TUSS4470, a ultrasonic sensor IC that can do much of the heavy lifting. He spun up an Arduino shield using this chip, and wrote the necessary code to interface directly with a commercial transducer.\nThis is already a huge milestone for DIY sonar, but [Neumi] isnt stopping there. The newest iteration of the hardware is designed not just to work with commercial transducers, but can be used with home-built ones as well. While the project isnt complete, hes made some very rapid progress as demonstrated in the video below.\nWeve covered a number of projects over the years that involved reading the depth of body of water, and this project would have been able to make each one of them cheaper and easier accomplish. While admittedly not every hacker is keen to map the bottom of their local waterway, we know there is a niche group out there that have been waiting a long time for a project like this to come around.\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bDIY\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u300cOpen Echo\u300d", "body": "Open Echo\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001DIY\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53d6\u5f97\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bDIY\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u300cOpen Echo\u300d", "- \u7121\u6599\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u6c34\u6df1\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3", "- \u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u305d\u3046\uff01\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6c34\u4e2d\u63a2\u67fb", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u4e3b\u5c0e\u306e\u958b\u767a\u304c\u751f\u3080\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

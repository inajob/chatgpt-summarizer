When youre working on embedded projects, its quite easy to run into hardware limitations, and quite suddenly, too. You find yourself desperately trying to find a way to speed things up, only there are no clock cycles to spare. Its at this point that you might reach for the magic of direct memory access (DMA). [Larry] is here to advocate for its use.\nDMA isnt just for the embedded world; it was once a big deal on computers, too. Its just rarer these days due to security concerns and all that. Whichever platform youre on, though, its a valuable tool to have in your arsenal. As [Larry] explains, DMA is a great way to move data from memory location to memory location, or from memory to peripherals and back, without involving the CPU. Basically, a special subsystem handles trucking data from A to B while the CPU gets on with whatever other calculations it had to do.\u00a0Its often a little more complicated in practice, but thats what [Larry] takes pleasure in explaining.\nIndeed, back before I was a Hackaday writer, I was no stranger to DMA techniques myself\u2014and I got my project published here! I put it to good use in speeding up an LCD library for the Arduino Due. It was the perfect application for DMA\u2014my main code could handle updating the graphics buffer as needed, while the DMA subsystem handled trucking the buffer out to the LCD quicksmart.\nIf youre struggling with updating a screen or LED strings, or you need to do something fancy with sound, DMA might just be the ticket. Meanwhile, if youve got your own speedy DMA tricks up your sleeve, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

(Credit: Brian Dipert, EDN)\nPeople think about NiMH cell chargers probably as much as they think about batteries, unless its time to replace the cells in whatever device theyre installed in. This doesnt make a teardown of one of these marvels any less interesting, especially when you can get an 8-bay charger with eight included NiMH cells for a cool $25 brand new. The charger even has USB ports on it, so its got to be good. Cue a full teardown by [Brian Dipert] over at\u00a0EDN to see what lurks inside.\nOf note is that [Brian] got the older version of EBLs charger, which requires that two cells of the same type are installed side-by-side instead of featuring per-bay charging. This is a common feature of cheaper chargers, and perhaps unsurprisingly the charger was struggling with NiMH cells that other chargers would happily charge.\nOpening up the unit required hunting for hunting plastic clips, revealing the rather sparse internals. Unsurprisingly, there wasnt a lot to look at, with the two USB ports apparently wired directly into the AC-to-DC section. Theres a CRE6536 AC-DC power management IC, the full-bridge rectifier and an unmarked 16-pin IC that presumably contains all of the charger logic. On the positive side, the mains-powered charger didnt catch on fire (yet), but for anyone interested in leaving battery chargers unattended for extended periods of time, perhaps look at a more reputable brand.", "title": "USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u4ed8\u304d8\u30d9\u30a4NiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256", "body": "8\u30d9\u30a4\u306eNiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306f\u7c21\u7d20\u3067\u3001\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u63a8\u5968\u3002", "titles": ["USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u4ed8\u304d8\u30d9\u30a4NiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256", "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eNiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u30c6\u30a2\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aNiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "EBL\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u5206\u6790", "NiMH\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

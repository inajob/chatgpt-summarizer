You should listen to [Liz McFarland] sharing her experience building a Wonder Woman suit, and not just any  the Golden Eagle suit from Wonder Woman 1984, adorned with a giant pair of wings. If a suit like that is in your plans, youll be warmly welcomed at a cosplay convention  and [Liz] had her sights on the San Diego Comic Con. With an ambitious goal of participating in the Comic Cons cosplay contest, the suit had to be impressive  and impressive, it indeed was, not just for its looks, but for its mechanics too.\n[Liz] tells us everything  from producing the wings and painting them, to keeping them attached to the body while distributing the weight, and of course, things like on-venue nuances and safety with regards to other participants. The dark side of cosplay building reality isnt hidden either  talking, of course, about the art of staying within a reasonably tight budget. This build takes advantage of a hackerspace that [Liz] is an active member in  the [Crash Space] in LA. Everything is in  lasercutting, 3D printing, and even custom jigs for bending wing-structual PVC pipes play a role.\nIt would have been a travesty to not have the wings move at will, of course, and [Liz] had all the skills you could want for making the wings complete. She went for two linear actuators, walking us through the mechanical calculations and considerations required to have everything fit together. Its not easy to build a set of wings on its own, let alone one that moves and doesnt crumble as you use it  if you have already attempted bringing mechanical creations like this into life, you can see the value in what [Liz] shares with us, and if you havent yet delved into it, this video will help you avoid quite a few pitfalls while setting an example you can absolutely reach.\nThe suit was a resounding success at the con, and got [Liz] some well-earned awards  today, the suits story is here for the hackers world. Now, your cosplay aspirations have an inspiring real-life journey to borrow from, and we thank [Liz] for sharing it with us.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u7fbd\u6839\u3064\u304d\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30a4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u5973\u6027\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\u300d", "body": "Liz created a Wonder Woman suit with wings for a cosplay contest at San Diego Comic Con.

Back then few areas had synchronized their clocks to something like Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or other standards like London time or Paris time, with everyone instead running on local time determined by as solar time. This created a massive headache for the railways, as they somehow had to make their time schedules work across what were effectively hundreds of tiny time zones while ensuring that passengers got on their train on time.\nIn a recent video [The Tim Traveller] explains how the creation of so-called Railway time sort-of solved this in France. As railroads massively expanded across the world by the 1850s and travel times dropped rapidly, this concept of Railway time was introduced from the US to Europe to India, creating effectively a railway-specific time zone synchronized to e.g. London time in the UK and Paris time in France. In addition to this, French railways also set the clocks inside the stations to run five minutes behind, to give travelers even more of a chance to get to their train on time when stuck in a long goodbye.\nBy 1911, across Europe GMT was adopted as the central time base, and the French five minute delay was eliminated as French travelers and trains were now running perfectly on time. If one wishes to experience what rail travel in the 1880s was like, travelers are invited to travel with Deutsche Bahn, who add a random delay to each actual arrival and departure time so that time becomes very relative indeed.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c19\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u9244\u9053\u6642\u9593\u306e\u6df7\u4e71\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u300d", "body": "19\u4e16\u7d00\u672b\u3001\u9244\u9053\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u300c\u9244\u9053\u6642\u9593\u300d\u304c\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6642\u523b\u306e\u7d71\u4e00\u304c\u9032\u3093\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c19\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u9244\u9053\u6642\u9593\u306e\u6df7\u4e71\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u300d", "- \u300c\u9244\u9053\u6642\u9593\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\uff1a\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8131\u5374\u300d", "- \u300c\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9244\u9053\u6642\u9593\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u5de5\u592b\u300d", "- \u300c\u30b0\u30ea\u30cb\u30c3\u30b8\u6a19\u6e96\u6642\u306e\u63a1\u7528\u3068\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u6642\u9593\u7d71\u4e00\u300d", "- \u300c1880\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u9244\u9053\u65c5\u884c\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d"]}

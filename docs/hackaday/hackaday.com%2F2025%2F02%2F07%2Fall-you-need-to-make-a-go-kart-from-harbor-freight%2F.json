But from time to time up pops something that merits a second look. A case in point is [BUM]s go-kart made entirely from Harbor Freight parts, a complete but rudimentary vehicle for around 300 dollars. It caught our eye because it shows some potential should anyone wish to try their luck with the same idea as a Power Racer or a Hacky Racer.\nThe chassis, and much of the running gear comes courtesy of a single purchase, a four-wheeled cart. Some cutting and welding produces a surprisingly useful steering mechanism, and the rear axle comes from a post hole digger. Power comes from the Predator gasoline engine, which seems to be a favourite among these channels.\nThe result is a basic but serviceable go-kart, though one whose braking system can be described as rudimentary at best. The front wheels are a little weak and require some reinforcement, but we can see in this the basis of greater things. Replacing that engine with a converted alternator or perhaps an electric rickshaw motor from AliExpress and providing it with more trustworthy braking would result in possibly the simplest Hacky Racer, or just a stylish means of gliding round a summer hacker camp.\n\n", "title": "\u7c21\u6613\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3060\u304c\u57fa\u76e4\u3068\u306a\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u6613\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u969b", "\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u6539\u5584\u6848", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

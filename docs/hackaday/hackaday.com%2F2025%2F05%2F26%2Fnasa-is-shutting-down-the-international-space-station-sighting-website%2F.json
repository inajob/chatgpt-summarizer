This means no information on sighting opportunities provided on the website, nor will users subscribed via the website receive email or text notifications. Instead anyone interested in this kind of information will have to download the mobile app for iOS or Android.\nObviously this has people, like [Keith Cowing] over at\u00a0Nasa Watch, rather disappointed, due to how the website has been this easy to use resource that anyone could access, even without access to a smart phone. Although the assumption is often made that everyone has their own personal iOS or Android powered glass slab with them, one can think of communal settings where an internet caf\u00e9 is the sole form of internet access. There is also the consideration that for children a website like this would be much easier to access. They would now see this opportunity vanish.\nWith smart phone apps hardly a replacement for a website of this type, its easy to see how the app-ification of the WWW continues, at the cost of us users.", "title": "\u300cNASA\u306eISS\u89b3\u5bdf\u60c5\u5831\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u304c2025\u5e746\u6708\u306b\u7d42\u4e86\u300d", "body": "2025\u5e746\u670812\u65e5\u304b\u3089NASA\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u304cISS\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u63d0\u4f9b\u3092\u7d42\u4e86\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u307f\u3067\u306e\u901a\u77e5\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cNASA\u306eISS\u89b3\u5bdf\u60c5\u5831\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u304c2025\u5e746\u6708\u306b\u7d42\u4e86\u300d", "\u300c\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u307f\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3078: NASA\u306e\u65b0\u65b9\u91dd\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u5931\u308f\u308c\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u516c\u5171\u306e\u5834\u3067\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u6e1b\u5c11: ISS\u89b3\u5bdf\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u300d", "\u300c\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6e1b\u5c11: NASA\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u300d"]}

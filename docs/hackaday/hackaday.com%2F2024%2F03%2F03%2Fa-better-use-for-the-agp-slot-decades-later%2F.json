This was the Accelerated Graphics Port, or AGP, a standard created to more quickly serve the 3D graphics cards which were then taking the world by storm. It was everywhere for a few years, then in the mid-2000s it was replaced by PCI Express and faded into obscurity. [Peter] has a Socket 7-based NAS with an AGP slot, and was left wondering whether the unused port could be put to a worthwhile purpose.\nAGP is a superset of PCI clocked at 66 MHz, and usually benefiting from having its own exclusive bridge to the processor bus. Thus he reasoned that he could make an AGP to PCI adapter and it might work, as the right connections are all there. A hacked-together version was made by butchering two riser cards, and when a network card worked quite happily he knew he was on to something and made a PCB. Theres a caveat that it only works with 66-MHz capable PCI cards so not everything will work, but if youre one of the very few people who must be in the market for one, he can do you a PCB.\nWed normally end with a link to a related project here, but we must instead congratulate [Peter]. As far as we can find, this is Hackadays first AGP hack, two decades later.\n", "title": "20\u5e74\u5f8c\u306eAGP: PCI\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u3063\u305f\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u7d0425\u5e74\u524d\u3001PC\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u306fPCI\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5c11\u3057\u77ed\u304f\u3001\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3055\u3089\u306b\u305a\u308c\u305f\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u308c\u304cAGP\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u30013D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u901f\u304f\u51e6\u7406\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002AGP\u306f2000\u5e74\u4ee3\u534a\u3070\u306bPCI Express\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002AGP\u3092PCI\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["20\u5e74\u5f8c\u306eAGP: PCI\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u3063\u305f\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "AGP\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "AGP\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066PCI\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eAGP\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "AGP\u304b\u3089PCI\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db: \u53e4\u3044\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

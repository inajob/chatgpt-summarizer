[Changliang Li] is apparently one of those people, because hes using soviet-era cold-cathode tubes as the logic for his Soviet-Era Style Clock\nAside from the nixies for display, the key component you see working in this beautiful machine are the MTX-90 cold cathode thyratrons, which look rather like neon tubes in action. Thats because they essentially are, just with an extra trigger electrode (that this circuit doesnt use). The neon tubes are combined into a loop counter, which translates the 50 Hz mains circuit in to seconds, minutes, and hours. The circuit is not original to this project, and indeed was once common to electronics books. The version used in this project is credited to [PA3FWM].\nThe Nixie tubes are new-made by [Sadudu] of iNixie labs, and we get a fascinating look in how they are made. (Tubemaking starts at around 1:37 in the video below.) It looks like a fiber laser is used to cut out glow elements for the tube, which is then encapsulated on a device which appears to be based around a lathe.\nThe cold-cathode tubes used as logic rely on ambient light or background radiation to start reliably, since the trigger electrode is left floating. In order to ensure reliable switching from the thyratrons, [Changliang Li] includes a surplus smoke detector source to ensure sufficient ionization. (The video seems to imply the MTX-90 was seeded with radioisotopes that have since decayed, but we could find no evidence for this claim. Comment if you know more.)\nThe end result is attractive and rather hypnotic. (Jump to 3:37 to see the clock in action.) If you want to know more about this sort of use for neon lamps (and the Soviet MTX-90) we featured a deeper dive a while back.\nThanks to [Changliang Li] for the incandescent tip. If one of your bright ideas has had a glow up into a project, dont hesitate to share it on our tips line.\n\n", "title": "- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u51b7\u9670\u6975\u7ba1\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u51b7\u9670\u6975\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30cb\u30ad\u30b7\u30fc\u7ba1\u3084MTX-90\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u51b7\u9670\u6975\u7ba1\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30cb\u30ad\u30b7\u30fc\u7ba1\u3068\u51b7\u9670\u6975\u30c1\u30e9\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u5149\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cb\u30ad\u30b7\u30fc\u7ba1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u9b45\u60d1\u7684\u306a\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

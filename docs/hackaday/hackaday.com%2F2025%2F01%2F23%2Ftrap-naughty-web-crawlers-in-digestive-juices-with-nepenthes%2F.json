These days, however, we have especially web crawlers from large language model (LLM) companies happily ignoring such signs on the lawn before proceeding to hover up every scrap of content on websites. Naturally this makes a lot of people very angry, but what can you do about it? The answer by [Aaron B] is Nepenthes, described on the project page as a tar pit for catching web crawlers.\nMore commonly known as pitcher plants, nepenthes is a genus of carnivorous plants that use a fluid-filled cup to trap insects and small critters unfortunate enough to slip  slide down into it. In the case of this Lua-based project the idea is roughly the same. Configured as a trap behind a web server (e.g. /nepenthes), any web crawler that accesses it will be presented with an endless number of (randomly generated) pages with many URLs to follow. Page generating is deliberately quite slow to not soak up significant CPU time, while still giving the LLM scrapers plenty of random nonsense to chew on.\nConsidering that these web crawlers deemed adhering to the friendly sign on the lawn beneath them, the least we can do in response, is to hasten model collapse by feeding these LLM scrapers whatever rolls out of a simple (optionally Markov-based) text generator.", "title": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6355\u307e\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30cd\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001Nepenthes\u304c\u904b\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7121\u9650\u306e\u7121\u610f\u5473\u306a\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6355\u307e\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6355\u307e\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30cd\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "LLM\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300c\u30cd\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u300d", "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u751f\u6210\u3067\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u60d1\u308f\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\uff1a\u30cd\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7f60\u3092\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226"]}

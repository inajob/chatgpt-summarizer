But if you just want to gaze at their beauty without making any noise, why not build this vacuum tube lamp from [Noel T\u00f6rj\u00e9k] instead?\n[Noel] got into some creative reuse with this build, with the main body consisting of a bell jar and wooden bowls. The internal structure is then created from jar lids, wire, metal sheeting, steel rods, and galvanized wire mesh. Simple modelling techniques are used to assemble the internal parts of the valve, including the grid and the electrodes and so on. As for light, [Noel] employed a ZigBee LED driver that he could control over his smart home setup via a Philips Hue bridge.\nThe final result looks like an extra-large tube. Anyone who knows what it is will spot that its not a real one, but theyre also exactly the audience that will appreciate it for what it is. Everyone else will probably just think youve taken an interest in strange art-deco replica lighthouses. Its not the first time weve seen replica valves around these parts, though, and were sure it wont be the last!"}

But theres an even older language that can make the same claim: LISP. Sure, some people think thats an acronym for lots of irritating spurious parenthesis, but if you can get past the strange syntax, the language is elegant and deceptively simple, at least at its core. Now, [Daniel Holden] challenges you to build your own Lisp as a way to learn C programming.\nIt shouldnt be surprising that LISP is fairly simple. It was the second-oldest language, showing up in the late 1950s with implementations in the early 1960s. The old hardware couldnt do much by todays standards, so it is reasonable that LISP has to be somewhat economical.\nWith LISP, everything is a list, which means you can freely treat code as data and manipulate it. Lists can contain items like symbols, numbers, and other lists. This is somewhat annoying to C, which likes things to have particular types, so thats one challenge to writing the code.\nWhile we know a little LISP, we arent completely sold that building your own is a good way to learn C. But if you like LISP, it might be good motivation. We might be more inclined to suggest Jones on Forth as a good language project, but, then again, it is good to have choices. Of course, you could choose not to choose and try Forsp."}

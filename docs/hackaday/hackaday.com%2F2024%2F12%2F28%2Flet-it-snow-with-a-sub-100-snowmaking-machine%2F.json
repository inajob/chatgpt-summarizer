He built a simple DIY snow making machine with a few plumbing parts, and tools you probably already have. Snowmaking machines used on the ski slopes cost tens of thousands of dollars. Even the low-cost home versions are $400 and up.\n[Matt] cut things down to the basics.\u00a0 Snowmaking requires two ingredients: Water and compressed air.\u00a0 The water is coming from a cheap electric pressure washer he found used.\u00a0 The air pressure is from an old air compressor. [Matt] is using his shop compressor  but even a cheap compressor will do fine.\nThe cold is an unforgiving environment though  so a few changes are needed. The trick is to use garden hose instead of air hose. Traditional air hose has a rather small hole. This leads to ice clogs coming from the compressor itself.\u00a0 A check valve also ensures that water from the pressure washer doesnt back up into the compressor.\nThe nozzles are pressure washer nozzles.\u00a0 Two 40 degree nozzles for the water, and a 65 degree nozzle for the air/water mix. In true hacker style, the frame of the machine is a ladder, and the gun attached via zip-ties.\nOf course you still need cold temperatures for this to work, but thats not too hard in the winter months. Now if you have the opposite problem of too much snow, check out this self clearing concrete.\n\n"}

If were honest, we remember them as not being very good. But that hasnt stopped the idea from resurfacing from time to time.\nWere reminded of it by [Mayuresh1611]s paper piano, in which a virtual piano keyboard is watched over by a webcam to detect the players fingers such that the correct note from a range of MP3 files is delivered.\nThe README is frustratingly light on details other than setup, but a dive into the requirements reveals OpenCV as expected, and TensorFlow. It seems theres a training step before a would-be virtual virtuoso can tinkle on the non-existent ivories, but the demo shows that theres something playable in there. We like the idea, and wonder whether it could also be applied to other instruments such as percussion. A table as a drum kit would surely be just as much fun.\nThis certainly isnt the first touch piano weve featured, but we think it may be the only one using OpenCV. A previous one used more conventional capacitive sensors.", "title": "OpenCV\u3068TensorFlow\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u904e\u53bb\u306bBluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u6295\u5f71\u3055\u308c\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3084\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u51e6\u7406\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4eee\u60f3\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e3b\u306a\u5185\u5bb9\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["OpenCV\u3068TensorFlow\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4eee\u60f3\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u9375\u76e4\u3092\u6301\u305f\u306a\u3044\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u3067\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\tstep"]}

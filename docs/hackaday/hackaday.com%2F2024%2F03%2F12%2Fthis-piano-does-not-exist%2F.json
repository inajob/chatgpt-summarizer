If were honest, we remember them as not being very good. But that hasnt stopped the idea from resurfacing from time to time.\nWere reminded of it by [Mayuresh1611]s paper piano, in which a virtual piano keyboard is watched over by a webcam to detect the players fingers such that the correct note from a range of MP3 files is delivered.\nThe README is frustratingly light on details other than setup, but a dive into the requirements reveals OpenCV as expected, and TensorFlow. It seems theres a training step before a would-be virtual virtuoso can tinkle on the non-existent ivories, but the demo shows that theres something playable in there. We like the idea, and wonder whether it could also be applied to other instruments such as percussion. A table as a drum kit would surely be just as much fun.\nThis certainly isnt the first touch piano weve featured, but we think it may be the only one using OpenCV. A previous one used more conventional capacitive sensors."}

In contrast, developing these days can be as simple as barking orders at ChatGPT to spit you out some Python code. However, that technique doesnt work so well for Amiga languages, as ChatGPT hasnt read much about the now-ancient platform. However, as covered by AmigaNews, there is now a ChatGPT model trained specifically on Amiga development. Enter Amiga Guru.\nThe work of [Cameron Armstrong], Amiga Guru was built after his early experiments with ChatGPT spat out non-functional gibberish when Amiga-compatible code was requested. The model has been trained on a corpus of official Amiga programming manuals, third-party books, and even the documentation for AmigaOS 3.2 and 4.1.\nUsing the model yourself requires a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, which prevents this writer from testing it directly. However, it makes sense that having been directly trained on Amiga manuals, it would be more capable at answering Amiga programming queries than conventional ChatGPT 4.\nIts easy to see the value of such a system. Learning to program for older platforms can be hard, with less resources available for new learners. Having an AI to help could be useful for some eager to develop for the 68K-based machine.\nIf youd like to try Amiga Guru, you can access it via this link. Be sure to let us know how you go, and whether you think it has any value for speeding up your own Amiga development. Otherwise, if youve been doing anything else nifty with the platform that Commodore bought and paid for, dont hesitate to let us know!\n[Thanks to Stephen Waters for the tip!]", "title": "Amiga\u958b\u767a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5c02\u7528ChatGPT\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u300cAmiga Guru\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "Amiga Guru\u306fAmiga\u958b\u767a\u7528\u306b\u8a13\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305fChatGPT\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3002Amiga\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8cea\u554f\u306b\u3088\u308a\u9069\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3002ChatGPT Plus\u306e\u8cfc\u8aad\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002Amiga Guru\u306f\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Amiga\u958b\u767a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5c02\u7528ChatGPT\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u300cAmiga Guru\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834", "Amiga Guru: \u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308bAI", "ChatGPT\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Amiga\u958b\u767a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Amiga Guru: AmigaOS\u3084\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305fChatGPT\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "ChatGPT Plus\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066Amiga Guru\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8"]}

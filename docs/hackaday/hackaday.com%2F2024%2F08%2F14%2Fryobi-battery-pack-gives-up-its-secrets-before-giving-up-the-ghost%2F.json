Those days are long gone, thankfully, and rechargeable battery packs have put powerful cordless tools in the palms of our hands. But when those battery packs go bad, replacing them becomes an expensive proposition. And thats a great excuse to pop a pack open and see whats happening inside.\nThe battery pack in question found its way to [Don]s bench by blinking some error codes and refusing to charge. Popping it open, he found a surprisingly packed PCB on top of the lithium cells, presumably the battery management system judging by the part numbers on some of the chips. There are a lot of test points along with some tempting headers, including one that gave up some serial data when the batterys test button was pressed. The data isnt encrypted, but it is somewhat cryptic, and didnt give [Don] much help. Moving on to the test points, [Don] was able to measure the voltage of each battery in the series string. He also identified test pads that disable individual cells, at least judging by the serial output, which could be diagnostically interesting.\u00a0 [Don]s reverse engineering work is now focused on the charge controller chip, which hes looking at through its I2C port. He seems to have done quite a bit of work capturing output and trying to square it with the chips datasheet, but hes having trouble decoding it.\nThis would be a great place for the Hackaday community to pitch in so he can perhaps get this battery unbricked. We have to admit feeling a wee bit responsible for this, since [Don] reports that it was our article on reverse engineering a cheap security camera that inspired him to dig into this, so wed love to get him some help.", "title": "\u518d\u5145\u96fb\u53ef\u80fd\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u518d\u5145\u96fb\u53ef\u80fd\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u6545\u969c\u3059\u308b\u3068\u4ea4\u63db\u304c\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u958b\u3051\u3066\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8abf\u3079\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u96fb\u6c60\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u518d\u5145\u96fb\u53ef\u80fd\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u89e3\u8aad", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u7ba1\u7406\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u6790", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u89e3\u8aad\u3068\u5fa9\u5143\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

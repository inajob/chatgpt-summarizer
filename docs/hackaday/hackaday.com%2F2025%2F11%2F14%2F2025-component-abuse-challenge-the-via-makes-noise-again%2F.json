[Normal User] appears to be chasing the later route, making PCM sound by abusing the serial port on a 6522 VIA chip.\nA serial port is when you think about it, a special case of a one-bit output port. Its designed for byte data communication but it can also carry a PCM data stream. Weve seen this used with microcontrollers and peripherals such as the I2S port plenty of times here at Hackaday, to produce such things as NTSC video. The 1970s-spec equivalent might not be as fast as its modern equivalent, but its capable of delivering audio at some level. The machine in question is a Ben Eater breadboard 6502 with a Worlds Worst Video Card, and as you can hear in the video below the break, its not doing a bad job for the era,\nIf you think this hack sounds a little familiar then in a sense youre right, because Ben Eater himself made noises with a 6522. However it differs from that in that he used the on-board timers instead. After all, the V in VIA stands for versatile.\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

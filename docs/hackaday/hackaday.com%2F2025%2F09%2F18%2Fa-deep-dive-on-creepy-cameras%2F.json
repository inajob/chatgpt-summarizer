[Benn Jordan] decided to take a closer look at the creepy cameras invading our public spaces and how to circumvent them.\n[Jordan] starts us off with an overview of how machine learning AI is used Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) cameras and some of the history behind their usage in the United States. Basically, when you drive by one of these cameras, an  image segmentation model or something similar detects the license plate and then runs optical character recognition (OCR) on the plate contents. It will also catalog any bumper stickers with the make and model of the car for a pretty good guess of it being your vehicle, even if the OCR isnt 100% on the exact plate sequence.\nWhere the video gets really interesting is when [Jordan] starts disassembling, building, and designing countermeasures to these systems. We get a teardown of a Motorola ALPR for in-vehicle use that is better at being closed hardware than it is at reading license plates, and [Jordan] uses a Raspberry Pi 5, a Halo AI board, and You Only Look Once (YOLO) recognition software to build a computer vision system thats much more accurate than anything on the market for law enforcement for $250.\n[Jordan] was able to develop a transparent sticker that renders a license plate unreadable to the ALPR but still plainly visible to a human observer. Whats interesting is that depending on the pattern, the system could read it as either an incorrect alphanumeric sequence or miss detecting the license plate entirely. It turns out, filtering all the rectangles in the world to find just license plates is a tricky problem if youre a computer. You can find the code on his Github, if you want to take a gander.\nYouve probably heard about using IR LEDs to confuse security cameras, but what about yarn? If youre looking for more artistic uses for AI image processing, how about this camera that only takes nudes or this one that generates a picture based on geographic data?\n\n"}

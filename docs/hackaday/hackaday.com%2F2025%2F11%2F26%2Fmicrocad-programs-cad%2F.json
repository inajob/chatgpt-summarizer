As programmers, we like describing objects we want to 3D print or otherwise model. As programmers, we hate all the strange things about OpenSCAD that make it not like a normal programming language. Maybe \u00b5CAD (or Microcad) is the answer. This new entry in the field lets you build things programmatically and is written in Rust.\nIn fact, the only way to get it right now is to build it from source using cargo. Assuming you already have Rust, thats not hard. Simply enter: cargo install microcad. If you dont already have Rust, well, then thats a problem. However, we did try to build it, and despite having the native library libmanifold available, Rust couldnt find it. You might have better luck.\n\nYou can get a feel for the language by going through one of the tutorials, like the one for building a LEGO-like shape. Heres a bit of code from that tutorial:\n\n\nuse std::geo2d::*;\nuse std::ops::*;\n\nconst SPACING = 8mm;\n\nop grid(columns: Integer, rows: Integer) {\n@input\n.translate(x = 1..columns] * SPACING, y = 1..rows] * SPACING)\n.align()\n}\n\nsketch Base(\ncolumns: Integer,\nrows: Integer,\nwidth: Length,\nheight: Length\n) {\nthickness = 1.2mm;\nframe = Frame(width, height, thickness);\nstruts = Ring(outer_d = 6.51mm, inner_d = 4.8mm)\n.grid(columns = columns-1, rows = rows-1);\nframe | struts;\n}\n\n\nThere are proper functions, support for 2D sketches and 3D objects, and even a VSCode extension.\nWill you try it? If we can get it to build, we will. Meanwhile, theres always OpenSCAD. Even TinkerCAD can do some parametric modeling."}

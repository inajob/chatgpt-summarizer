Whatever that means.\nId just like to interject for a moment. What youre referring to as Christmas is, in fact, Happy/Holidays.\nBefore settling their brains in for a long winters nap, theyll talk about the open source software podcast that now calls Hackaday home, the latest firmware developments for Googles Stadia controller, high-definition cat videos from space, and upgrades for the surprisingly old-school battery tech that powers the Toyota Prius.\nOut on the lawn, expect a clatter about the the state-of-the-art in DIY camera technology, the acoustic properties of hot chocolate, and a storage media from the 1990s that even Al Williams had never heard of.\nFinally, after tearing open the shutters and throwing up the sash, the episode wraps up with a discussion about wiring techniques that let you leave the soldering iron at home, and the newest chapter in the long history of transferring data via parachute. Miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer sold separately.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\nDownload the gift you really want this year: this weeks podcast in DRM-free MP3.\n\nEpisode 249 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nTWiT  Show Changes and Cancellations\nFLOSS Weekly Episode 762: Spilling The Tea\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThis weeks sound was a Rubiks Cube!

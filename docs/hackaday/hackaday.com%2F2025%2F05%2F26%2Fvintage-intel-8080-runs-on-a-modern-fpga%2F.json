[Mark] has built a full system board for the venerable 8080A-1, pushing it to run at a slick 3.125\u202fMHz. Remarkable is that he\u2019s done so using a modern Microchip FPGA, without vendor lock-in or proprietary flashing tools. Every step is open source.\nGetting this vintage setup to work required more than logical tinkering. Mark\u2019s board supplies the \u00b15\u202fV and +12\u202fV rails the 8080 demands, plus clock and memory interfacing via the FPGA. The design is lean: two-layer PCB, basic level-shifters, and a CM32 micro as USB-to-UART fallback. Not everything went smoothly: incorrect footprints, misrouted gate drivers, thermal runaway in the clock section; but he managed to tackle it.\nWhat sets this project apart is the resurrection of a nearly 50-year-old CPU. It\u2019s also, how thoroughly thought-out the modern bridge is\u2014from bitstream loading via OpenOCD to clever debugging of crystal oscillator drift using a scope. [Mark]\u2019s love of the architecture and attention to low-level detail makes this more than a show-off build.\nWatch [Mark]s video here or pull his files from his repo on GitHub. Let us know what purpose it could have for you!\n\n"}

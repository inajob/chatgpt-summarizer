Maybe you want to keep yourself out of the cookie jar. We say good for you.\nBut you could always put one of these alarms on a window, a drawer, or anything else you dont want opened or moved. The MPU6050 3-axis IMU makes sure that any way the chosen item gets jostled, that alarm is going off.\nAs you may have guessed, there isnt much more to this build  the brain is a Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3, and theres a buzzer, a battery, a switch, and a push button to program it.\nThe cool thing about using an ESP32-C3 is that [gokux] can use these for other things, like performing a task when motion is detected. If you do want to build yourself a couple of these, here are step-by-step instructions.\nIf youd rather detect motion in the vicinity, heres a PIR-based solution."}

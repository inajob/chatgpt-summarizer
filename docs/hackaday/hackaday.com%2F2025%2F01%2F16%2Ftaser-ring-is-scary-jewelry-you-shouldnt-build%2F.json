However, the word is also colloquially used to refer to just about any device intended for delivering electric shocks to an adversary. The taser ring from [Penguin DIY] definitely fits that description, though wed strictly advise you not to consider building this at home.\nThe build is a hacky one. An arc generator circuit was pulled out from a jet cigarette lighter, and reconfigured to fit in a small ring-based form factor. It was hooked up with a power switch and a small bank of 30 mAh lithium polymer cell for power, and a compact USB-C charger board was installed to keep the batteries juiced. The electronics were then delicately assembled into a ring-shaped mold, which was injected with resin to produce the final ring. Once cast, a pair of small metal electrodes were installed on the outside. Activating the taser function is as simple as squeezing the ring\u2014easy to do just by making a fist.\nWeve seen projects like these before; our advice is usually to avoid them unless you really know what youre doing. Whether you end up shocking someone else or accidentally shocking yourself, the results tend to be bad. The latter seems particularly easy to do if youre wearing this thing on your finger. Given its a ring, dont expect to be able to pull it off in a hurry, either. Its hard to see how that ends well.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "body": "\u30bf\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3001DIY\u30bf\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u5371\u967a\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u306f\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u8003\u5bdf", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u5236\u4f5c\u306f\u5371\u967a\uff01\u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- \u7d20\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u30c6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u6307\u5357"]}

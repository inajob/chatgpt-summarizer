Now, some of us can wait for a 1.8V level shifter adapter from an online store of your choosing, but [treble] got a BIOS flash failed motherboard from Facebook Marketplace, and decided to make it work immediately.\nShe tells us a story about reviving the motherboard, and theres one thing she shows that is interesting in particular  a very simple way to level shift 3.3V signals from a serprog-flashed Pi Pico down to the 1.8V that the flash chip required, something you are guaranteed to be able to build out of the parts in your parts bin, only requiring nine resistors and an NPN transistor. If you ever need to reflash BIOS on a modern motherboard, take note. As for 1.8V rail, she ended up tapping the 1.8V power pin of the SPI chip the motherboard itself to power the chip while programming it.\nIn the end, after swapping the two BIOS chips places and fixing a broken trace mishap, the motherboard booted, and works wonderfully to this day, a much-needed upgrade to [treble]s toolkit that allows her to do RISC-V cross-compiling with ease nowadays. This is not the first time we see people reflash modern boards with 1.8V chips  if you want to learn more, check out this incredibly detailed writeup! Need to do some further debugging? Use your Pico as a POST card!"}

One of the more fascinating ones is the magnetohydrodynamic drive (MHDD), which uses the Lorentz force to propel a watercraft through the water. The somewhat conductive seawater is thus the working medium, with no moving parts required.\nThe end of the MHD thruster from the Yamato-1.\nAlthough simple in nature, only the Japanese Yamato-1 full-scale prototype ever carried humans in 1992. As covered in a recent video by [Sails and Salvos], the prototype spent most of its time languishing at the Kobe Maritime Museum, until it was scrapped in 2016.\nThere are two types of MHDD, based around either conduction  involving electrodes  or induction, which uses a magnetic field. The thrusters used by the\u00a0Yamato-1 used the latter type of MHDD, involving liquid helium-cooled, super-conducting coils. The seawater with its ions from the dissolved salts responds to this field by accelerating according to the well-known right-hand rule, thus providing thrust.\nThe main flaw with an MHDD as used by the\u00a0Yamato-1 is that its not very efficient, with a working efficiency of about 15%, and a top speed of about 15 km/h (8 knots). Although research in MHDDs hasnt ceased yet, the elemental problem of seawater not really being that great as the fluid without e.g. adding more ions to it has meant that ships like the\u00a0Yamato-1 are likely to remain an oddity like the\u00a0Lun-class ekranoplan ground effect vehicle.\nFor as futuristic as this technology sounds, its suprisingly straightforward to build a magnetohydrodynamic drive of your own in the kitchen sink.\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "- \u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u529b\u3067\u8239\u3092\u63a8\u9032\uff01\u78c1\u6c17\u6d41\u4f53\u99c6\u52d5\uff08MHDD\uff09\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "MHD\u63a8\u9032\u306f Lorentz \u529b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3067\u30011992\u5e74\u306b\u6212\u540d-1\u304c\u8a66\u9a13\u7684\u306b\u904b\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u529b\u3067\u8239\u3092\u63a8\u9032\uff01\u78c1\u6c17\u6d41\u4f53\u99c6\u52d5\uff08MHDD\uff09\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30e4\u30de\u30c8-1\uff1a\u4eba\u985e\u3092\u4e57\u305b\u305f\u521d\u306eMHDD\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- \u78c1\u6c17\u6d41\u4f53\u63a8\u9032\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f\uff1a\u30e4\u30de\u30c8-1\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u78c1\u6c17\u6d41\u4f53\u99c6\u52d5\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u6d77\u6c34\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u672a\u6765\u306e\u8239\u306e\u63a8\u9032\u6280\u8853\u3001MHDD\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u9650\u754c"]}

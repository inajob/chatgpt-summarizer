The short answer is it depends. The medium-sized answer is, it depends on some back-of-the-envelope calculations specific to your project. That is what [Slant 3D} proposes in a recent video that you can view below.\u00a0 The executive summary is that injection molding is great for when you want to churn out lots of the same parts, but you have to amortize the mold(s), cover shipping and storage, and find a way to deal with unsold inventory. In a hypothetical scenario in the video, a simple plastic widget may appear to cost just 10 cents vs 70 cents for the 3D printed part, but with all intermediate steps added in, the injection molded widget is suddenly over twice as expensive.\nIn the even longer answer to the question, you would have to account for the flexibility of the 3D printing pipeline, as it can be used on-demand and in print farms across the globe, which opens up the possibility of reducing shipping and storage costs to almost nothing. On the other hand, once you have enough demand for an item (e.g., millions of copies), it becomes potentially significantly cheaper than 3D printing again. Ultimately, it really depends on what the customers needs are, what kind of volumes they are looking at, the type of product, and a thousand other questions.\nFor low-volume prototyping and production, 3D printing is generally the winner, but at what point in ramping up production does switching to an injection molded plastic part start making sense? This does obviously not even account for the physical differences between IM and FDM (or SLA) printed parts, which may also have repercussions when switching. Clearly, this is not a question you want to flunk when it concerns a business that you are running. And of course, you should bear in mind that these numbers are put forth by a 3D printing company, so at the scale where molding becomes a reasonabe option, youll also want to do your own research.\nWhile people make entire careers out of injection molding, you can do it yourself in small batches. You can even use your 3D printer in the process. If you try injection molding on your own, or with a professional service, be sure to do your homework and learn what you can to avoid making costly mistakes.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u751f\u7523\u91cf\u306e\u89b3\u70b9\u304b\u3089", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u578b\u306e\u9069\u5207\u306a\u9078\u629e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8ff0\u3079\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u91cf\u3084\u8cbb\u7528\u9762\u3001\u9867\u5ba2\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u9078\u629e\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u3002\u4f4e\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u3067\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u52dd\u3061\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u5897\u7523\u6bb5\u968e\u3067\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u578b\u304c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u306a\u9078\u629e\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u751f\u7523\u91cf\u306e\u89b3\u70b9\u304b\u3089", "\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21\u751f\u7523\u306b\u6700\u9069\uff1f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u6ce8\u76ee\u3059\u3079\u304d\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u6210\u578b\u54c1\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\uff1a\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304c\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u304b\uff1f", "\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\uff1a\u751f\u7523\u91cf\u304c\u5897\u3048\u308b\u3068\u304d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u8003\u616e\u4e8b\u9805"]}

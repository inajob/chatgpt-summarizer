They not only produced PCs but also a huge number of video game consoles. Although they were a major contributor to the video game crash of the 1980s, they managed to limp along a few more years afterward and produce some interesting machines in the following years, even though they werent ultimately able to compete with Nintendo or Sega. One of those computers from that era was a PC-console hybrid of sorts called the Atari XE, and [Sideburn] was able to turn one into a laptop.\nThe retro laptop began life as an Arabic PAL version of the 65XE, the PC version of the ubiquitous 65-series computer. A large portion of the computer was reworked, including the removal of the power supply in favor of a rechargeable battery with a 6-hour life. Also among the list of scrapped components was the video and sound connectors as well as the RF modulator, which would have been common for displays at the time, but this laptop is getting a 19201080 LCD panel to replace all of that old hardware. A 1MB memory upgrade, new speakers and amp, a WiFi card, and an SD floppy card emulator round out the build.\nThe final part of the build is assembling it all into a custom 3D printed case, and the resulting laptop that [Sideburn] calls the XE Book is a faithful adaptation of this niche computer into what could have been a laptop we would have seen in the late 80s or early 90s similar to the Toshiba T3200SXC. It matches the originals footprint and still uses all of the core components, so its not too difficult to imagine something like this having existed in the past.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30bf\u30eaXE\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u300cXE Book\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "body": "\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306ePC-console\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC\u300cXE Book\u300d\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30bf\u30eaXE\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u300cXE Book\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "\u6614\u306e\u540d\u6a5f\u304c\u8607\u308b\uff01\u30a2\u30bf\u30eaPC\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7", "\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306e\u907a\u7523\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af", "\u30a2\u30bf\u30eaXE\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8\u306b\u518d\u751f\uff01\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u6539\u826f\u7248\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7"]}

Laser light is playing on the walls, and even though its quite a journey from England to get here, Im home. This is Hackfest Enschede, a two-day event in the Eastern Dutch city which by my estimation has managed the near-impossible feat of combining the flavour of both a hacker event and a maker faire all in one, causing the two distinct crowds to come together.\nThe Best Of Both Worlds, In One Place\nTo give an idea of whats here its time for a virtual trip round the hall. Ill start with the music, aside from the demosceners theres Printstruments with a range of 3D-printedmusical instruments, and Nerdy Gurdy, as you may have guessed, that hacker hurdy-gurdy I mentioned. This is perhaps one of few places I could have seen a spontaneous jam session featuring a 3D-printed bass and a laser-cut hurdy-gurdy. Alongside them were the Eurorack synthesisers of Sound Force, providing analogue electronic sounds aplenty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompeting with the musicians are the sounds of 8-bit gaming, as the Home Computer Museum are here with an array of Dutch computers including the Philips range, a Tulip PC, and the super-futuristic Holborn business computer. Theyre joined by Atari Invasion, and Im as always pleased to see youngsters discovering the machines my generation had at their age, for themselves. The more hacker side of the hardware community is here in force, with the local Fablab Saxion and Tkkrlab hackerspace. The Fablab had brought along a really neat Lego assembling robot derived from a 3D printer. Then theres badge.team showing off their electronic event badges, and the ever-enthusiastic Mitch Altman bringing his soldering workshop. This representts only a snapshot of whats here, Ive also seen printing (the old-fashioned kind), combat robots, dancing corn starch, Yvo de Haas robot tentacles, and Ubuntu Mobile, to name but a few others.\nCan We Capture This, And Bottle It?\nSuch an array of cool stuff is always good to see, but my take-away from this event lies not on the tables at the hall. Instead its in the way that here theyve managed to capture what was great about the early maker events, the raw edge of creativity before all the STEM and webshops selling blinky LEDs moved in, and maintain an attraction for people from the hacker community. I think the key to the success lies in combining the stuff described above with a more hacker-friendly set of talks, and oddly in the venue itself. Enschede is easy to get to but not somewhere that demands premium prices on everything, so going along wasnt the deal-breaker that a more shiny event might have been.\nIts great to see an events first try draw to a close with a feeling of success, and we hope there will be another Hackfest to go to in Enschede next year. But Im more interested to see whether this event may seed others, fresh new events trying a similar formula. I hope Ill see you there."}

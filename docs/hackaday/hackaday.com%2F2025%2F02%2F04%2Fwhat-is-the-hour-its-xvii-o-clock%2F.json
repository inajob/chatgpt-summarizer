That means no digital watches, and certainly no pulling out your fantastic rectangle from the future to find out if youre late picking up the kid.\nSo what do you do when youre LARPing at 2 PM, but you gotta be back at the soccer practice field by 5 PM? Well, you fashion a period-appropriate timepiece like [mclien]s 17 o Clock. Visually, its about as close to a pocket sundial as you can get. Its deliberately non-connected, and its only function is to tell the time.\nBut how? If you visually divide the watch across the top and bottom, you get two sets of Roman numerals. The top half handles the hour, and the bottom half the minute. [mclien] started designing this in 2018 and picked it back up in the second half of 2024.\nBack to the non-connected part. The only permanently-powered part of the project is a high-precision real-time clock (RTC). The rest uses a power latching circuit, which turns on the Adafruit Trinket M0 to show the time using a NeoPixel ring. Be sure to check out the awesome project logs with fantastic pictures throughout.\nLooking for a smarter pocket watch? Its time you built one yourself.

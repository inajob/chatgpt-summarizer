The operations of these algorithms are opaque to us; commentators forever speculate as to whether they just show us what they think we want to see, or whether they try to guide our thinking and habits in a given direction. The Digital Poison device\u00a0 from [Lucretia], [Auxence] and [Ramon] aims to twist and bend the algorithm to other ends.\nThe concept is simple enough. The device consists of a Raspberry Pi 5 operating on a Wi-Fi network. The Pi is set up with scripts to endlessly play one or more select YouTube videos on a loop. The videos arent to be watched by anyone; the device merely streams them to rack up play counts and send data to YouTubes recommendation algorithm. The idea is that as the device plays certain videos, it will skew what YouTube recommends to users sharing the same WiFi network based on perceived viewer behavior.\nTo achieve subtle influence, the device is built inside an unobtrusive container. The idea being that it could be quietly connected to a given WiFi network to stream endlessly, in turn subtly influencing the view habits of other users on the same network.\nIts difficult to say how well this concept would work in practice. In many cases, sites like YouTube have robust user tracking that feeds into recommendation algorithms. Activity from a random user signed into the same network might not have much of an influence. However, conceptually, its quite interesting, and the developers have investigated ways to log the devices operation and compare it to recommendations fed to users on the network. Privacy provisions make this difficult, but it may be possible to pursue further research in this area. Files are on Github for the curious.\nUltimately, algorithms will always be a controversial thing as long as the public cant see how they work or what they do. If youre working on any projects of your own in this space, dont hesitate to let us know!\n[Thanks to Asher for the tip!]", "title": "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dd\u30a4\u30ba\u30f3\u300d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u300cDigital Poison\u300d\u306f\u3001YouTube\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u8996\u8074\u7fd2\u6163\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dd\u30a4\u30ba\u30f3\u300d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fYouTube\u518d\u751f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- Wi-Fi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b"]}

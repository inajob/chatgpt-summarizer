But of course even the most laid back of creatures needs to eat, so youll have to make sure to feed them regularly. If youre a fish owner who would like to simplify tending to your creatures, you might find value in this project from [CrazyScience].\nThis fish feeder is based on an Arduino Uno, the 8-bit microcontroller development board which has done so much for so many. The Arduino drives a stepper motor, which rotates a 3D printed disc mechanism for dispensing food. Each slot of the disc is loaded with a small amount of fish food, so that when it rotates, a slot dumps its contents through a slot into the water.\nActivating the system is as easy as a wave of the hand. Thats thanks to an ultrasonic sensor, which detects movement close by, and triggers the food delivery mechanism in turn. Wed love to see this upgraded with a timer mode too, though it would require the addition of a real-time clock module to the humble Arduino Uno.\nIts a simple project, but one that teaches all kinds of useful skills, from programming to design and 3D printing. We just worry that the fish bowl in the demo is a far too small for fish to remain healthy. Weve seen some other similar projects before, too.\n\n", "title": "Arduino Uno\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u9b5a\u306e\u3048\u3055\u7bb1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u9b5a\u306f\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u624b\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u306b\u990c\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002Arduino Uno\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u7d66\u990c\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u9b5a\u306e\u990c\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u6d3b\u6027\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3001\u624b\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u990c\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Arduino Uno\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u9b5a\u306e\u3048\u3055\u7bb1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u81ea\u52d5\u7d66\u990c\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9b5a\u306e\u990c\u3092\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b Arduino\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u7d66\u990c\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u9b5a\u306e\u990c\u3084\u308a\u6a5f\uff1aArduino\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc", "\u9b5a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306aArduino\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u7d66\u990c\u88c5\u7f6e"]}

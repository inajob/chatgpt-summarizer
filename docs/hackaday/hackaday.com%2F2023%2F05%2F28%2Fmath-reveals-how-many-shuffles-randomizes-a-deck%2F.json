There are different shuffling methods, and dealing methods can matter, too. [Jason Fulman] and [Persi Diaconis] are behind the research that will be detailed in an upcoming book, The Mathematics of Shuffling Cards, but the main points are easy to cover.\nA riffle shuffle (pictured above) requires seven shuffles to randomize a 52-card deck. Laying cards face-down on a table and mixing them by pushing them around (a technique researchers dubbed smooshing) requires 30 to 60 seconds to randomize the cards. An overhand shuffle  taking sections from a deck and moving them to new positions  is a staggeringly poor method of randomizing, requiring some 10,000-11,000 iterations.\nThe method of dealing cards can matter as well. Back-and-forth dealing (alternating directions while dealing, such as pattern A, B, C, C, B, A) yields improved randomness compared to the more common cyclic dealing (dealing to positions in a circular repeating pattern A, B, C, A, B, C). Its interesting to see different dealing methods shown to have an effect on randomness.\nThis brings up a good point: there is not really any such a thing as more random. A deck of cards is either randomized, or it isnt. If even two cards have remained in the same relative positions (next to one another, for example) after shuffling, then a deck has not yet been randomized. Similarly, if seven proper riffle shuffles are sufficient to randomize a 52-card deck, there is not really any point in doing eight or nine (or more) because there isnt any such thing as more random.\nYou can watch these different methods demonstrated in the video embedded just under the page break. Now we know theres no need for a complicated Rube Goldberg-style shuffling solution just to randomize a deck of cards (well, no mathematical reason for one, anyway.)\n\n"}

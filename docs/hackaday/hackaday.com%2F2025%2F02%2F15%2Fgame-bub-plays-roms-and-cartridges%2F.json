A Raspberry Pi and a controller of some sort is perhaps the easiest and simplest way to go to get this job done, but to really impress the masses some extra effort is required. This handheld from [Eli] called the Game Bub not only nails the appearance and feel of the first three generations of Nintendo handhelds but, thanks to its FPGA, can play not only ROMs but the original game cartridges as well.\nAs [Eli] notes, the FPGA is not strictly necessary for emulation, but does seem to be better at interfacing with physical hardware like controllers and game cartridges. For this task an Xilinx XC7A100T with integrated memory was chosen, with a custom PCB supporting the built-in controller, speaker, a rechargeable lithium battery, and a 480320 display (that had to be rotated out of portrait mode). An SD Card reader is included for any ROM files, and theres also a ESP32-S3 included to give the handheld WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, with future plans to support the communications protocol used by the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter.\nThere are a few other features with the Game Bub as well, including the ability to use an authentic link cable to communicate with the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, and a Switch-like dock that allows the Game Bub to be connected to an external monitor. Its also open source, which makes it an even more impressive build. Presumably it doesnt include the native ability to dump cartridges to ROM files but you dont need much more than a link cable to do that if you need to build your ROM library.\n\n\nThanks to [Charles] for the tip!", "title": "- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300cGame Bub\u300d", "body": "Game Bub\u306f\u3001FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u300190\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3001WiFi\u3084Bluetooth\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u88c5\u5099\u3002", "titles": ["- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300cGame Bub\u300d", "- FPGA\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Game Bub\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "- WiFi\uff06Bluetooth\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u672a\u6765\u5fd7\u5411\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "- \u65e7\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\uff01\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3067\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

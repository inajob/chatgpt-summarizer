This will give you the power to emulate thousands of games and you can run one off batteries inside a handheld of your own devising. [Redherring32] took an altogether more creative and old-school approach with the TinyTendo, however. This is one pocket-sized NES that actually runs on genuine hardware. (Nitter)\nThe feat was achieved by drastically reducing the size of the original NES hardware to make it fit into a Game Boy style form factor. Key to this work was creating a custom cut-sized motherboard which uses original Nintendo DIP chips that have been machined down to become more like QFN-style surface mount packages. With that done, the chips can be assembled onto the TinyTendo PCB which is even smaller than a contemporary Raspberry Pi 3. Its all assembled in a custom case, with USB C for charging and a bright and colorful LCD screen.\nThe TinyTendo is designed to use mini-cartridges created by [Bucket Mouse], a hacker whos no stranger to impressive custom Game Boy hardware. By virtue of running genuine NES hardware, theres also the possibility that the TinyTendo could play full-sized NES carts with a simple adapter.\nThis project has been a long time in the making; we first looked at [Redherring32]s efforts back in 2021. It begs the question why the original NES was so big when Nintendo clearly had plenty of space to spare in those hefty DIP packages! Its amazing what can be done with some creativity and perseverance.\n\nThis is TinyTendo, a real hardware NES handheld that is the size of the original GameBoy. This is not emulation, it is not a Pi, it is not a NOAC, and it is not an FPGA. This is real NES hardware from a real NES. \nThis project will also be open sourced in a few weeks. pic.twitter.com/Csf10EYPcc\n Redherring32 (@redherring32) May 24, 2022\n"}

However, this project submitted by [Mads Chr. Olesen] is anything but a simple.\nIn this project, he sets out to double the RAM on a Olimex A20-OLinuXino-LIME2 single-board computer. The Lime2 came with 1 GB of RAM soldered to the board, but he knew the A20 processor could support more and wondered if simply swapping RAM chips could double the capacity. He documents the process of selecting the candidate RAM chip for the swap and walks us through how U-Boot determines the amount of memory present in the system.\nWhile your desktop likely has RAM on removable sticks, the RAM here is soldered to the board. Swapping the chip required learning a new skill: BGA soldering, a non-trivial technique to master. Initially, the soldering didn\u2019t go as planned, requiring extra steps to resolve issues. After reworking the soldering, he successfully installed both new chips. The moment of truth arrived\u2014he booted up the LIME2, and it worked! He now owns the only LIME2 with 2 GB of RAM.\nBe sure to check out some other BGA soldering projects weve featured over the years.", "title": "- Olimex A20-OLinuXino-LIME2\u3067\u306eRAM\u500d\u5897\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Mads Chr.

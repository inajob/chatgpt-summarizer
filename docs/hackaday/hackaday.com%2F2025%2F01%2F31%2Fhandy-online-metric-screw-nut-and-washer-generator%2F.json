Fastener hardware is pretty accessible, but one never knows when a 3D printed piece will hit the spot. One might even be surprised what can be usefully printed on a decent 3D printer at something like 0.08 mm layer height.\nBehind the scenes, [Jason]s tool is an OpenSCAD script with a very slick web-based interface that allows easy customization of just about any element one might need to adjust, including fine-tuning the thread sizing. Were fans of OpenSCAD here and appreciate whats going on behind the scenes, but one doesnt need to know anything about it to use the online tool.\nGenerated models can be downloaded as .3mf or .stl, but if you really need a CAD model youre probably best off looking up a part and downloading the matching 3D model from a supplier like McMaster-Carr.\nPrefer to just use the OpenSCAD script yourself, instead of the web interface? Select Download STL/CAD Files from the dropdown of the project page to download ScrewGenerator.scad for local use, and youre off to the races."}

What is this miracle speed reduction technology, you ask? Well, it\u2019s shoelaces and a bunch of 3D printed plastic, at least in [Aaed Musa]\u2019s latest installment in his series on developing his own robot dog.\nOK, the shoelaces were only used in the first proof of concept. [Aaed] shortly upgrades to steel cable, and finds out that steel fatigues and snaps after a few hours. He settles on Dyneema DM-20, a flexible yet non-stretching synthetic rope.\nBefore its all over, he got a five-bar linkage plotting with a pencil on the table and a quadriped leg jumping up and down on the table  to failure. All in all, it points to a great future, and we cant wait to see the dog-bot thats going to come out of this.\nThere\u2019s nothing secret about using capstan drives, but we often wonder why we don\u2019t see cable-powered robotics used more in the hacker world. [Aaed] makes the case that it pairs better with 3D printing than gears, where the surface irregularities really bind. If you want to get a jumpstart, the test fixture that hes using is available on GitHub.\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about capstan drives, you absolutely need to check out our own [Sonya Vasquez]\u2019s Cable Mechanism Maths. She brought some demos of her gear reduction mechanisms to Supercon, and they just feel like butter.

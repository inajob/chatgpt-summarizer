Youre looking at the bottom of the print. [Make Wonderful Things] wondered whether unsightly unsupported bridges could be improved, and has been busy nailing down remarkably high-quality results by exhaustive testing of different settings.\nIt all started when they thought that unsupported bridges looked a lot as though they were made from ropes stretched between two points. Unlike normal layers, these stretched extrusions didnt adhere to their neighbors. They are too far apart from one another, and theres no squish to them. But could this be overcome?\nHis experiments centered mainly around bridge printing speed, temperature, and bridge flow. That last setting affects how much the extrusion from the hot end is adjusted when printing a bridge. He accidentally increased it past 1.0 and thought the results were interesting enough to follow up on; it seemed that a higher flow rate when printing a bridge gave the nudge that was needed to get better inter-line adhesion. What followed was a lot of testing, finally settling on something that provided markedly better results than the stock slicer settings. Markedly better on his test pieces, anyway.\nBF = Bridge flow, BS = Bridge printing speed (in mm/sec)\nThe best results seem to come from tweaking the Bridge Flow rate high enough that extrusions attach to their neighbors, printing slowly (he used 10 mm/sec), and ensuring the bridged area is as consistent as possible. There are still open questions, like some residual sagging at corners he hasnt been able to eliminate, but the results otherwise look great. And it doesnt even require laying ones printer on its side!\nAll the latest is on the project page where you can download his test models, so if youre of a mind to give it a try be sure to check it out and share your results. Watch a short video demonstrating everything, embedded just under the page break.\nThanks to [Hari] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6539\u5584", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6a4b\u306e\u6539\u5584\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u3001\u6d41\u91cf\u3084\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3057\u3001\u63a5\u7740\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6539\u5584", "- \u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3057\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5370\u5237\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u8abf\u6574", "- \u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5370\u5237\u306e\u6d41\u91cf\u3068\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u898b\u76f4\u3057\u3066\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u305f\u7d50\u679c", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u96a3\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u306e\u63a5\u7740\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u6cd5", "- \u5b9f\u7e3e\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u305f\u6539\u5584\u7b56\u3068\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u60c5\u5831"]}

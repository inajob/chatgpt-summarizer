(Lukewarm take: it\u2019s just a fast moving comet.) But that doesn\u2019t stop it from being interesting \u2013 its relatively fast speed and odd trajectory make astronomers wonder where it\u2019s coming from, and give us clues about how old it is likely to be.\nAstronomy is the odd-man-out in the natural sciences. In most branches of physics, chemistry, and even biology, you can run experiments. Even those non-experimental corners of the above fields, like botany, for instance, you can get your hands on the objects you\u2019re talking about. Not so astronomy. When I was studying in college, one of my professors quipped that astronomers were pretty happy when they could hammer down a value within an order of magnitude, and ecstatic when they could get a factor of two or three. The deck is simply stacked against them.\nWith that background, I love two recent papers about 3I/ATLAS. The first tries to figure out why it\u2019s moving so fast by figuring out if it\u2019s been going that fast since its sun kicked it out, or if it has picked up a gravitational boost along the way. While they can\u2019t go all the way back in time, they\u2019ve worked out whether it has flown by anything close enough to get a significant boost over the last 10 million years. This is impressive that we can calculate the trajectory so far back, but at the same time, 10 million years is peanuts on the cosmic timescale.\nAccording to another paper, there is a weak relationship between interstellar objects\u2019 age and their velocity, with faster-moving rocks being older, they can estimate the age of 3I/ATLAS at between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, assuming no gravitational boosts along the way. While an age range of 7 billion years may seem like a lot, that\u2019s only a factor of two. A winner for astronomy!\nSnarkiness aside, its old age does make a testable prediction, namely that it should be relatively full of water ice. So as 3I/ATLAS comes closer to the sun in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll either see it spitting off lots of water vapor, and the age prediction checks out, or we won\u2019t, and they\u2019ll need to figure out why.\nWhatever happens, I appreciate how astronomers aren\u2019t afraid to outline what they can\u2019t know \u2013 orbital dynamics further back than a certain date, or the precise age of rocks based solely on their velocity. Most have also been cautious about calling the comet a spaceship. On the other hand, if it is, one thing\u2019s for sure: after a longer-than-10-million-year road trip, whoever is on board that thing is going to be hungry.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

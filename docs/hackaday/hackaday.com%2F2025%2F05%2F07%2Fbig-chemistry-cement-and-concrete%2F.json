It was an interesting article, right up my alley, and helpfully contained a top-ten list that I could use as a crib sheet for future articles, at least for the ones I hadnt covered already, like the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia.\nNumber one on the list surprised me, though: sulfuric acid. The article stated that it was far and away the most produced chemical in the world, with 36 million tons produced every year in the United States alone, out of something like 265 million tons a year globally. Its used in a vast number of industrial processes, and pretty much everywhere you need something cleaned or dissolved or oxidized, youll find sulfuric acid.\nStaggering numbers, to be sure, but is it really the most produced chemical on Earth? Id argue not by a long shot, when theres a chemical that we make 4.4 billion tons of every year: Portland cement. It might not seem like a chemical in the traditional sense of the word, but once you get a look at what it takes to make the stuff, how finely tuned it can be for specific uses, and how when mixed with sand, gravel, and water it becomes the stuff that holds our world together, you might agree that cement and concrete fit the bill of Big Chemistry.\n\nRock Glue\nTo kick things off, it might be helpful to define some basic terms. Despite the tendency to use them as synonyms among laypeople, cement and concrete are entirely different things. Concrete is the finished building material of which cement is only one part, albeit a critical part. Cement is, for lack of a better term, the glue that binds gravel and sand together into a coherent mass, allowing it to be used as a building material.\nWhat did the Romans ever do for us?

The Romans get an outsized but well-deserved portion of the credit thanks to their use of pozzolana, a silicate-rich volcanic ash, to make the concrete that held the aqueducts together and built such amazing structures as the dome of the Pantheon. But the use of cement in one form or another can be traced back at least to ancient Egypt, and probably beyond.\nAlthough there are many kinds of cement, well limit our discussion to Portland cement, mainly because its what is almost exclusively manufactured today. (The Portland name was a bit of branding by its inventor, Joseph Aspdin, who thought the cured product resembled the famous limestone from the Isle of Portland off the coast of Dorset in the English Channel.)\nPortland cement manufacturing begins with harvesting its primary raw material, limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock rich in carbonates, especially calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which tends to be found in areas once covered by warm, shallow inland seas. Along with the fact that limestone forms between 20% and 25% of all sedimentary rocks on Earth, that makes limestone deposits pretty easy to find and exploit.\nCement production begins with quarrying and crushing vast amounts of limestone. Cement plants are usually built alongside the quarries that produce the limestone or even right within them, to reduce transportation costs. Crushed limestone can be moved around the plant on conveyor belts or using powerful fans to blow the crushed rock through large pipes. Smaller plants might simply move raw materials around using haul trucks and front-end loaders.\u00a0Along with the other primary ingredient, clay, limestone is stored in large silos located close to the star of the show: the rotary kiln.\nTurning and Burning\nA rotary kiln is an enormous tube, up to seven meters in diameter and perhaps 80 m long, set on a slight angle from the horizontal by a series of supports along its length. The supports have bearings built into them that allow the whole assembly to turn slowly, hence the name. The kiln is lined with refractory materials to resist the flames of a burner set in the lower end of the tube. Exhaust gases exit the kiln from the upper end through a riser pipe, which directs the hot gas through a series of preheaters that slowly raise the temperature of the entering raw materials, known as rawmix.\nThe rotary kiln is the centerpiece of Portland cement production. While hard to see in this photo, the body of the kiln tilts slightly down toward the structure on the left, where the burner enters and finished clinker exits.

Different reactions occur as the temperature increases. At the top of the kiln, the 500 \u00b0C heat decomposes the clay into silicate and aluminum oxide. Further down, as the heat reaches the 800 \u00b0C range, calcium oxide reacts with silicate to form the calcium silicate mineral known as belite:\n\nFinally, near the bottom of the kiln, belite and calcium oxide react to form another calcium silicate, alite:\n\nIts worth noting that cement chemists have a specialized nomenclature for alite, belite, and all the other intermediary phases of Portland cement production. Its a shorthand that looks similar to standard chemical nomenclature, and while were sure it makes things easier for them, its somewhat infuriating to outsiders. Well stick to standard notation here to make things simpler. Its also important to note that the aluminates that decomposed from the clay are still present in the rawmix. Even though theyre not shown in these reactions, theyre still critical to the proper curing of the cement.\nPortland cement clinker. Each ball is just a couple of centimeters in diameter.

The extreme heat causes the material to sinter, a physical change that partially melts the particles and adheres them together into small, gray lumps called clinker. When the clinker pellets drop from the bottom of the kiln, they are still incandescently hot. Blasts of air that rapidly bring the clinker down to around 100 \u00b0C. The exhaust from the clinker cooler joins the kiln exhaust and helps preheat the incoming rawmix charge, while the cooled clinker is mixed with a small amount of gypsum and ground in a ball mill. The fine gray powder is either bagged or piped into bulk containers for shipment by road, rail, or bulk cargo ship.\nThe Cure\nMost cement is shipped to concrete plants, which tend to be much more widely distributed than cement plants due to the perishable nature of the product they produce. True, both plants rely on nearby deposits of easily accessible rock, but where cement requires limestone, the gravel and sand that go into concrete can come from a wide variety of rock types.\nConcrete plants quarry massive amounts of rock, crush it to specifications, and stockpile the material until needed. Orders for concrete are fulfilled by mixing gravel and sand in the proper proportions in a mixer housed in a batch house, which is elevated above the ground to allow space for mixer trucks to drive underneath. The batch house operators mix aggregate, sand, and any other admixtures the customer might require, such as plasticizers, retarders, accelerants, or reinforcers like chopped fiberglass, before adding the prescribed amount of cement from storage silos. Water may or may not be added to the mix at this point. If the distance from the concrete plant to the job site is far enough, it may make sense to load the dry mix into the mixer truck and add the water later. But once the water goes into the mix, the clock starts ticking, because the cement begins to cure.\n\nCement curing is a complex process involving the calcium silicates (alite and belite) in the cement, as well as the aluminate phases. Overall, the calcium silicates are hydrated by the water into a gel-like substance of calcium oxide and silicate. For alite, the reaction is:\n\nScanning electron micrograph of cured Portland cement, showing needle-like ettringite and plate-like calcium oxide.

Without the needle-like ettringite crystals, aluminate ions would adsorb onto alite and block it from hydrating, which would quickly reduce the plasticity of the mix. Ideally, the ettringite crystals interlock with the calcium silicate gel, which binds to the surface of the sand and gravel and locks it into a solid.\nDepending on which adjuvants were added to the mix, most concretes begin to lose workability within a few hours of rehydration. Initial curing is generally complete within about 24 hours, but the curing process continues long after the material has solidified. Concrete in this state is referred to as green, and continues to gain strength over a period of weeks or even months."}

[Simon the Magpie] scored one of these decks and decided to turn it into a tape echo effect instead. It didnt work so well, but the concept is a compelling one. You can see the result in the video below.\nThe core of the effect is a tape loop, which [Simon] set up to loop around a pair of hacked-up cassette shells. This allows him to place one half of the loop in the Coca-Cola cassette player and the other half in a more conventional desktop tape deck. A 3D-printed bracket allows the two decks and the tape loop to be assembled into one complete unit.\nThe function is simple. The desktop tape deck records onto the loop, with the Coca-Cola unit then playing back that section of tape a short while later. Hey, presto  its a tape delay! Its super lo-fi, though, and the tape loop is incredibly fragile.\n\nTheres some charm in the warbly, weird sounds coming out of the Coca-Cola tape player. [Simon] turns this to his advantage and drops an incredibly catchy avant-garde pop hook with great results. It reminds us of some great DIY hardware we saw many years ago. Weve been seeing a lot of tape echos lately, but we dont know why.\n", "title": "\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u578b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u7f36\u306e\u5f62\u3092\u3057\u305f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u307f\u304c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3067\u9332\u97f3\u3057\u3066\u518d\u751f\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3067\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u578b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b", "DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u306b\u5927\u5909\u8eab", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u578b\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b", "\u30ed\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u578b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\uff1a\u30b3\u30ab\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30e9\u7f36\u578b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5909\u5e7b\u81ea\u5728\u306a\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9"]}

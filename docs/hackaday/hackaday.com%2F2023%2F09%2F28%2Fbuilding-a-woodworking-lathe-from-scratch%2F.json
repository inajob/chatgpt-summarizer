Sometimes though, theres great value in putting a simple and rugged version of your own, as demonstrated by [bartworker]s woodworking lathe build.\u00a0\nThe core of the build is a hefty wooden base, something that is a core component of any good machine tool. It was built from a large beam sourced from a ship supply house, and originally used to hold a sturdy vice. It eventually gained a motor from a cement mixer when [bartworker] decided it should be converted into a lathe. From there, it was further equipped with a sliding support for larger workpieces, allowing [bartworker] to lathe some seriously big stock.\nThe lathe is very much an ever-evolving thing, and [bartworker] has used it to share the joys of woodworking with his family and friends. As a demonstration of its abilities, the lathe was able to produce a handsome handle for [bartworker]s axe.\nAs this story shows, the only thing better than a tool you build yourself is one that your friends get to enjoy too! Meanwhile, if youve been whipping up your own machinery, dont hesitate to drop us a line!"}

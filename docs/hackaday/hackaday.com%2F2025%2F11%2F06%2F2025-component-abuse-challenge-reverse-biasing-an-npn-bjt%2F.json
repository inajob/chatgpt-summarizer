(Note: this remark about N-P-N reading the same forward and backward is a lighthearted joke; in fact the level of doping in the emitter and collector is different so those Ns are not fungible and will exhibit different properties and have different characteristics.)\nIn the margin you can see how the question was originally posed by Bob Pease back in March 18, 1996.\nIn his article [Tim] mentions that some transistors are specifically designed to operate when reverse biased, which [Tim] calls inverted mode, whereas most transistors are not designed to work in this fashion and thats the sort of abuse that could damage the component and lead it to malfunction.\nBut what is Vout? [Tim] reports that he measured approximately -0.4 volts using his high-impedance meter. We tried this experiment in the lab ourselves but we were not able to duplicate [Tim]s result; however there is a long list of potential reasons for such an outcome. If you do this experiment yourself we would love to hear about your results in the comments section!\nIf youre still learning about transistors you might like to check out our five part series on transistors as amplifiers, starting here: Won\u2019t Somebody, Please, Think Of The Transistors!\nThanks to [Tim] for his submission, we wish him the best of luck in the competition!\n \n\n\n", "title": "- NPN\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8003\u5bdf\u3068\u7d50\u679c\u3002", "titles": ["- NPN\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- Tim Williams\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9006\u8ee2\u5229\u7528\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "- \u6e2c\u5b9a\u7d50\u679c -0.4\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\uff1a\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u3068\u8003\u5bdf", "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u8a98\u3044\uff1a\u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

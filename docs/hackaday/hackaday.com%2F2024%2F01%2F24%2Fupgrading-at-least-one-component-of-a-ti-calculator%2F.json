At the time there wasnt much demand for previously non-existent products like these, so to drive some business they built the first hand-held calculator, a venture that they are still famous for today. Since then, though, theyve become a bit of a punchline for producing calculators with decades-old technology but with modern price tags, so while this business model was quite successful if you want a calculator with a few modern features youll have to take a DIY approach like this calculator retrofitted with a LiPo battery.\nThe modern battery pack, with a lithium polymer battery at its core, includes all of the circuitry needed to integrate it seamlessly into the TI-59 calculator, which is all available on the projects GitHub page. This calculator originally used a 9V battery, so the new battery pack includes a boost converter to match the 3.7V from the new battery to the needs of the old calculator. It doesnt stop there, though. The pack is rechargeable from an included USB-C port, has a built-in charge controller, and is housed in its own custom-built case that fits neatly into the calculator where the old battery would sit.\nWhile this wouldnt be a drop-in replacement for more modern calculators like the TI-83/84 and TI-89, a new case and a different boost converter would solve the problem of the AAA batteries dying during exams. It might make the calculators non-compliant with various standardized testing requirements, though (which TI was also instrumental in developing) so you may want to verify with your testing standard of choice before modifying a calculator you need for an exam. But if all the rules are off, why not add Wi-Fi to it too?", "title": "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u96fb\u5353\u306b\u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u3092\u66f4\u65b0\uff01LiPo\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30c6\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c4\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c4\u306f\u6700\u521d\u306e\u96c6\u7a4d\u56de\u8def\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6642\u4ee3\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u6210\u529f\u306f\u4fdd\u8a3c\u3055\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u6027\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u96fb\u5353\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u3067\u306f\u6614\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u9ad8\u984d\u306a\u624b\u6301\u3061\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u3092\u751f\u7523\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001DIY\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u96fb\u5353\u306b\u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u3092\u66f4\u65b0\uff01LiPo\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30c6\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c4\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c4\u306e\u6709\u540d\u306a\u624b\u6301\u3061\u96fb\u5353\u304c\u8fd1\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u308b", "\u30c6\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c4\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c4\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u3092DIY\u3067\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30c6\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c4\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c4\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u306b\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\uff01\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u624b\u9806", "\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff01\u30c6\u30ad\u30b5\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c4\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c4\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bLiPo\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080"]}

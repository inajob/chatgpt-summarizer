No offense to the fine folks at the foundation, but even the HQ camera, while very good, isnt quite professional grade. Thats why when photographer [Malcom Wilson] put together this Mini Hasselblad style camera, he hacked in a 1 sensor.\nThe sensor in question came in the form of a OneInchEye V2, from [Will Whang] on Tindie. The OneInch Eye is a great project in its own right: it takes a Sony IMX283 one-inch CMOS image sensor, and packages it with an IMU and thermal sensor on a board that hooks up to the 4-lane MIPI interface on the Rasberry Pi CM4 and Pi 5.\nSensor in hand, [Malcom Jay] needed but to figure out power and view-finding. Power is provided by a Geekworm X1200 battery hat. Thats the nice thing about the Pi ecosystem: with so many modules, its like lego for makers. The viewfinder, too, uses 4 HDMI screen sold for Pi use, and hes combined it with a Mamiya C220 TLR viewfinder to give that look-down-and-shoot effect that gives the project the Mini Hasselblad moniker.\nThese are a few images [Malcom] took with the camera. Were no pros, but at least at this resolution they look good.The steel-PLA case doesnt hurt in that regard either, with the styling somewhat reminiscent of vintage film cameras. The steel isnt just a colour in this case, and the metal actually makes the PLA conductive, which our photographer friend learned the hard way. Who hasnt fried components on a surface they didnt realize was conductive, though? We bet the added weight of the steel in the PLA makes this camera much nicer to hold than it would be in plain plastic, at least.\nThe OneInchEye module came set up for C-mount lenses, and [Malcom] stuck with that, using some Fujinon TV lenses he already had on hand. [Malcom] has released STL files of his build under a creative-commons noncommercial license, but hes holding the code back for subscribers to his Substack.\nThis isnt the first Pi-based camera weve seen from [Malcom]. and thereve been quite a few others on these pages over the years. There was even a Hackaday version, to test out the offical module [Malcom] eschewed.\nThanks to [Malcom] for the tip.", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30011\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306eMini Hasselblad\u98a8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3084\u4ed5\u69d8\u3082\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5236\u4f5c", "- OneInchEye\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Geekworm\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30cf\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u4f9b\u7d66\u3092\u884c\u3046\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u98a8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "- Fujinon\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3Raspberry Pi\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

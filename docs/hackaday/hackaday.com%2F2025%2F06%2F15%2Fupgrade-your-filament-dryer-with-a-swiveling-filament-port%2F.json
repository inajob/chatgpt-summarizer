This handy feature allows you to print from the spool without removing it from the dryer, saving time and limiting exposure to (moist) air. Unfortunately, these exit ports arent always thought out very well, mostly in terms of the angle with the spool as it unrolls. The resulting highly oblique orientation means a lot of friction of the filament on the side of the port. This issue is addressed in a recent [Teaching Tech] video, with a simple, low-cost solution.\nThe basic idea is to have a swiveling port, inspired by a spherical bearing. The design shown in the video uses a PC4-M6 pneumatic connector to pass the PTFE tube. Connector choice is critical here, as many PC4-M6 pneumatic connectors wont accommodate the PTFE.\u00a0 As a fallback, you can drill out a connector to enable this.\nOnce the connector is sorted, you need a 13 mm (~0.5) step drill bit to widen the opening in the filament dryer. This ready-to-print version has 10 degrees of freedom in any direction, but you can adapt it to fit your needs. With this mod installed, the angle with which the filament enters the port should remain as close to zero as possible, preventing both friction and damage to the port and filament.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6539\u826f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u56de\u8ee2\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "FDM\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08\u6539\u5584\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6539\u826f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u56de\u8ee2\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6469\u64e6\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\uff01PC4-M6\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u89d2\u5ea6\u8abf\u6574", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u6539\u9020\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u6559\u3048\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u6469\u8017\u3092\u9632\u3050\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

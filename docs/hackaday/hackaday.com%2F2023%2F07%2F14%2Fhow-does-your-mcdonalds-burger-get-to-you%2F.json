How does the system work? [Whiterose Infosec] scored one of the beacons, and subjected it to a teardown and some probing.\nThe beacon in question has the look of being an older model judging by the 2009 date codes on its radio module and the evident corrosion on its battery terminals. Its Bluetooth 4 SoC is end-of-life, so its possible that this represents a previous version of the system. It has a few other hardware features, including a magnet and a sensor designed to power the board down when it is stacked upon another beacon.\nProbing its various interfaces revealed nothing, as did connecting to the device via Bluetooth. However some further research as well as asking some McDs employees revealed some of its secret. It does little more than advertise its MAC address, and an array of Bluetooth base stations in the restaurant use that to triangulate its approximate position.\nIf youve ever pondered how these beacons work while munching on your McFood, you might also like to read about McVulnerabilities elsewhere in the system.", "title": "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\u8abf\u67fb", "body": "\u300c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3068\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306f\u76f8\u53cd\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u601d\u3048\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6ce8\u6587\u6642\u306b\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u756a\u53f7\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3001\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u304c\u98df\u3079\u7269\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u89e3\u6790\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001MAC\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3068Bluetooth\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a00\u53ca\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\u8abf\u67fb", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u89e3\u6790", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u6f0f\u6d29\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308b", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac"]}

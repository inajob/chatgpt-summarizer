But [Dr. Gerg] found a shortcoming of this otherwise very flexible product: since each run is intended to start and end in a surface mounted box, he couldnt find an end cap that would let him close off a section.\nThe solution? A desktop 3D printer and a chunk of OpenSCAD code telling it what to extrude. When you break it down, the Wiremold profile is fairly straightforward, and can be easily described with geometric primitives. A handful of cylinders, a cube or two, tie it all together with the hull() function, and youre there.\nWed say this would be a fantastic project to cut your OpenSCAD teeth on, but since [Dr. Gerg] was kind enough to share the source code, you dont have to figure it out on your own. Though theres still benefit in reading over it if youre looking for some practical examples of how the Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller gets things done.\nSo why would you want a Wiremold endcap? In the case of [Dr. Gerg], it sounds like he was trying to cover up a short run of wire that was running vertically. But we could imagine other applications for this basic design now that its out in the wild. For example, a short length of Wiremold outfitted with a pair of printed caps could make for a nice little enclosure if youve got a small project that needs protecting.", "title": "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u7aef\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Wiremold\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u5145\u5b9f\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u914d\u7dda\u306e\u6577\u8a2d\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068OpenSCAD\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u7528\u9014\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u7aef\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u7aef\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u3092OpenSCAD\u3067\u8a2d\u8a08", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u7528\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7aef\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u8853"]}

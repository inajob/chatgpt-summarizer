Whats less expected is that they were used for a half-serious attempt at making an educational family computer in the early 2000s. This is however what [Nicole Branagan]\u00a0 tripped over at the online Goodwill store, in the form of a European market Famiclone that was still in its original box. Naturally this demanded an up-close investigation and teardown.\nThe system itself comes in the form of a keyboard that seems to have been used for a range of similar devices based on cut-outs for what looks like some kind of alarm clock on the top left side and a patched over hatch on the rear. Inside are the typical epoxied-over chips, but based on some scattered hints it likely uses a V.R. Technologys VTxx-series Famiclone. The manufacturer or further products by them will sadly remain unknown for now.\nWhile theres a cartridge slot that uses the provided 48-in-1 cartridge  with RAM-banked 32 kB of SRAM for Family BASIC  its compatibility with Famicom software is somewhat spotty due to the remapped keys and no ability to save, but you can use it to play the usual array of Famicom/NES games as with the typical cartridge-slot equipped Famiclone. Whether the provided custom software really elevates this Famiclone that much is debatable, but it sure is a fascinating entry.", "title": "- \u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "body": "\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u305f\u4f8b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u3067\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306f\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "- \u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u767a\u898b", "- \u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\uff01\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256", "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u8b0e", "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3/NES\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f53\u9a13"]}

This building block of all modern electronics does a lot more than simply performing as a switch, for as [Aleksei Tertychnyi] tells us, it can also function as a temperature sensor.\nHow does this work? Simple enough, the base-emitter junction of a transistor can function as a diode, and like other diodes, it shows a roughly 0.2 volt per degree voltage shift with temperature (for a silicon transistor anyway). Taking a transistor and forward biasing the junction with a 33 K resistor, he can read the resulting voltage directly with an analogue to digital converter and derive a temperature reading.\nThe transistor features rarely as anything but a power device in the projects we bring you in 2025. Maybe you can find inspiration to experiment for yourself, and if you do, you still have a few days in which to make your own competition entry.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u9053: \u6e29\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u9053: \u6e29\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2: \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6e29\u5ea6\u6e2c\u5b9a", "- \u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3067\u6e29\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 2025\u5e74\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8: \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c: \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6e29\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u4f5c\u6210\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

This building block of all modern electronics does a lot more than simply performing as a switch, for as [Aleksei Tertychnyi] tells us, it can also function as a temperature sensor.\nHow does this work? Simple enough, the base-emitter junction of a transistor can function as a diode, and like other diodes, it shows a roughly 0.2 volt per degree voltage shift with temperature (for a silicon transistor anyway). Taking a transistor and forward biasing the junction with a 33 K resistor, he can read the resulting voltage directly with an analogue to digital converter and derive a temperature reading.\nThe transistor features rarely as anything but a power device in the projects we bring you in 2025. Maybe you can find inspiration to experiment for yourself, and if you do, you still have a few days in which to make your own competition entry.\n \n\n\n"}

[Snappiness] has one, and also having a liking for waist-level viewfinders as found on twin-lens reflex cameras, decided to make a new Camp Snap with a waist-level viewfinder. Its a digital twin-lens reflex camera, of sorts.\nInside the Camp Snap is the little webcam module weve come to expect from these cameras, coupled with the usual microcontroller PCB that does the work of saving to SD card. Its not an ESP32, but if youve ever played with an ESP32-CAM board youre on a similar track. He creates a 3D-printed TLR-style case designed to take the PCB and mount the camera module centrally, with ribbon cable extensions taking care of placement for the other controls. The viewfinder meanwhile uses a lens, a mirror, and a Fresnel lens, and if you think this might look a little familiar its because hes based it upon his previous clip-on viewfinder project.\nThe result, with an added Snappiflex logo and filter ring, is a rather nice-looking camera, and while it will preserve the dubious quality of the Camp Snap, it will certainly make the process of using the camera a lot more fun. We think these cheap cameras, and particular their even less expensive AliExpress cousins, have plenty of hacking potential as yet untapped, and were keen to see more work with them. The full video is below the break.\n\n"}

Its typically used for running a computer at the basic pre-OS level, and most of us dont even notice it past boot time. However, you can do some neat things in this space\u2014you can even port over Nyan Cat if youre talented like [Cornelius].\nThats fun. Set your friends computer to boot into this instead of their OS by default and see how long it takes them to figure it out.\nYes, Nyan Cat is now available as a UEFI application, running via the EFI Simple Text Output Protocol. [Cornelius] approached this creation by first learning Rust, before progressing to the Hello World stage. Before long, the computer was booting up to display a simple text message with no OS required.\nFrom there, creating the Nyan Cat animation required figuring out how to display it as a bunch of dancing characters, which is where the Simple Text Output Protocol came in. Nyan Cat was really the perfect animation for the UEFI environment, since its simple pixel art style was easily recreated with text. With a bit of work, the animation came together, with a remarkable resemblance to the original artwork.\nAll thats missing is a routine to play the music over a PC speaker; only, those are hardly a thing anymore. A pity!

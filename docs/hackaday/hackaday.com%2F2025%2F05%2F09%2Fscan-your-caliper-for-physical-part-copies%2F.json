We like what [Scale Addition] shows in the video below. In addition to a picture of the part, he also takes a picture of a vernier caliper gripping the part. Now your scale is built into the picture, and you can edit out the caliper later.\nHe uses SketchUp, but this would work on any software that can import an image. Given the image with the correct scale, it is usually trivial to sketch over the image or even use an automatic tracing function. You still need some measurements, of course. The part in question has a vertical portion that doesnt show up in a flat photograph. Weve had good luck using a flatbed scanner before, and theres no reason you couldnt scan a part with a caliper for scale.\nThis is one case where a digital caliper probably isnt as handy as an old-school one. But it would be possible to do the same trick with any measurement device. You could even take your picture on a grid of known dimensions. This would also allow you to check that the distances at the top and bottom are the same as the distances on the right and left.\nOf course, you can get 3D scanners, but they have their own challenges.\n\n", "title": "- CAD\u3067\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5bf8\u6cd5\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5199\u771f\u306b\u76ee\u76db\u308a\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3001CAD\u3067\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- CAD\u3067\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5bf8\u6cd5\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5199\u771f\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u5229\u70b9"]}

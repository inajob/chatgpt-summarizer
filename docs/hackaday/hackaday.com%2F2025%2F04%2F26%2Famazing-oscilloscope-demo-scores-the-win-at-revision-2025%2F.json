Thats precisely what [BUS ERROR Collective] members [DJ_Level_3] and [Marv1994] delivered with their prize-winning Primer demo this week.\nThis demo is a grand example of so-called oscilloscope music\u2014where two channels of audio are used to control an oscilloscope in X-Y mode. The sounds played determine the graphics on the screen, as weve explored previously.\nThe real magic is when you create very cool\u00a0sounds that also draw\u00a0very cool graphics on the oscilloscope. The\u00a0Primer\u00a0demo achieves this goal perfectly. Indeed, its intended as a primer on the very artform itself, starting out with some simple waveforms and quickly spiraling into a graphical wonderland of spinning shapes and morphing patterns, all to a sweet electronic soundtrack. It was created with a range of tools, including Osci-Render and apparently Ableton 11, and the recording performed on a gorgeous BK Precision Model 2120 oscilloscope in a nice shade of green.\nIf you think this demo is\u00a0fully sick, youre not alone. It took out first place in the Wild category at the Revision 2025 demo party, as well as the Crowd Favorite award. High praise indeed.\nWe love a good bit of demoscene magic around these parts.\n\n\nThanks to [STrRedWolf] for the tip!", "title": "\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u4f53\u611f\u3059\u308b\u300cPrimer\u300d\u30c7\u30e2", "body": "[BUS ERROR Collective]\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u300cPrimer\u300d\u306f\u6280\u8853\u529b\u3068\u97f3\u697d\u304c\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3001\u8996\u899a\u3068\u8074\u899a\u306e\u7f8e\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u4f53\u611f\u3059\u308b\u300cPrimer\u300d\u30c7\u30e2", "\u6280\u8853\u529b\u3092\u8a87\u793a\u3059\u308b\uff01\u300cPrimer\u300d\u30c7\u30e2\u306e\u6210\u529f\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u96fb\u5b50\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u63cf\u304f\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "Revision 2025\u3067\u306e\u6700\u9ad8\u8cde\u53d7\u8cde\u300cPrimer\u300d\u30c7\u30e2\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "Osci-Render\u3068Ableton\u3067\u5275\u308a\u51fa\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0"]}

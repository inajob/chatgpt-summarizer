Why, beg the heavens? For you could be using an\u00a0air mouse, of your very own creation! [Misfit Maker] shows the way. Check out what he made in the video below.\nAn air mouse is a mouse you use in the air\u2014which creates at least one major challenge. Since youre not sliding along a surface, you cant track the motion by mechanical friction like a ball mouse or by imaging as in an optical mouse. Instead, this build relies on a gyroscope sensor to track motion and translate that into pointer commands. The build relies on an ESP32-C3 as the microcontroller at the heart of things. It communicates with an MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer to track motion in space. It then communicates as a human interface device over Bluetooth, so you can use it with lots of different devices. The mouse buttons\u2014plus media control buttons\u2014are all capacitive touch-sensitive, thanks to an MPR121 touch sensor module.\nTheres something neat about building your own tools to interface with the machines, almost like it helps meld the system to your whims. We see a lot of innovative mouse and HID projects around these parts.\n\n"}

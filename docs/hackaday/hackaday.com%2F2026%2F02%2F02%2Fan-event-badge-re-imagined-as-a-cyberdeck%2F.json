Its a fork of a conference badge.\nThe WHY2025 badge had pretty capable hardware, with an ESP32-P4, a really nice screen, and the lovely SolderParty keyboard. Here its been forked, to become a carrier board for their previous project, the Flipper Blackhat. This is a Linux add-on for the Flipepr Zero, and it seems that plenty of people wanted it in a more useful context. The result is something that looks a lot like a WHY badge, but running Linux.\nIts a great shame when badges end up lying unused after the event, and ones like the WHY 2025 badge are a serious effort to make something that endures. Here, the badge endures in spirit by being forked and re-engineered, and we like it a lot. The full video is below the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u300cWHY2025\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u304cLinux\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u9032\u5316\u300d", "body": "WHY2025\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u304cLinux\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u3001\u518d\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300cWHY2025\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u304cLinux\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u9032\u5316\u300d", "- \u300c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7528\u9014\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "- \u300c\u4f59\u3063\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cESP32-P4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u624b\u8efd\u306aLinux\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cRootkit Labs\u304c\u624b\u639b\u3051\u308b\u4f1a\u8b70\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u518d\u8a2d\u8a08\u300d"]}

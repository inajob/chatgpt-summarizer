[Shane]s designs for the Pretty Small Robot are quite contrary to that, being tiny in stature and cute in affect.\nThe whole robot is an exploration in nifty engineering. It uses an easy clip-together structure with fasteners and glue not required. The chassis is 3D printed, with all the components sliding into place. Two small DC gearmotors are used for differential drive, with each side of the robot having a pair of wheels wrapped in a rubber band for traction. The brains of the robot is an ESP32, providing it with both plenty of processing power and good connectivity options. Control is over WiFI via MQTT.\nAt this stage the robot doesnt do a whole lot, though [Shane] has some exciting plans. Hed like to add a camera in future and let it explore a maze under human command.\nIf youve ever wanted to build a robot with an almost coin-sized foot print, this build is for you. Files are available on GitHub for those wishing to dive deeper. Video after the break.\n\n"}

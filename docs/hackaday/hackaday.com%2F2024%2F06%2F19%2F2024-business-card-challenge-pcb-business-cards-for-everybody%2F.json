For their entry into the 2024 Business Card Challenge, [Dima Shlenkevitch] is helping a little to alleviate this by providing a set of design examples and worked costs\u00a0with suppliers.\nOriginal green is still the cheapest option.\n[Dima] lists key features every PCB business card should include, such as the expected thickness, restrictions for placing NFC components, and some aesthetics tips. Make sure to choose a supplier that allows you to remove their order number from the manufactured PCB, or it will look out of place.\nOrdering PCBs with these specifications to keep costs reasonable requires effort, so [Dima] offers some example designs along with the results. If you want to have pretty gold lettering and graphics, you will need ENiG plating, increasing the price. Non-standard solder mask colors can also raise the price.\nWill this help with the practical aspects of driving the PCB design software and actually placing the order? Obviously not, but the information provided gives you a leg up on some of the decisions so you dont go down an expensive rabbit hole.\n \n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306ePCB\u540d\u523a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u4f8b", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u6280\u8853\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306ePCB\u540d\u523a\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u304c\u4f9d\u7136\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u7a00\u5c11\u30022024\u5e74\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3078\u5411\u3051[Dima Shlenkevitch]\u304c\u8a2d\u8a08\u4f8b\u3068\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u7dd1\u304c\u6700\u3082\u5b89\u4fa1\u3002NFC\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8a2d\u7f6e\u5236\u9650\u3084\u5916\u89b3\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306ePCB\u540d\u523a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u4f8b", "2024\u5e74\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u5411\u3051PCB\u540d\u523a\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6307\u5357", "PCB\u540d\u523a\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "PCB\u540d\u523a\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "PCB\u540d\u523a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u7559\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8"]}

But what is it when youre neither adding material nor taking it away to create something? Generally speaking, thats called forming, and while there are tons of ways to do it, one you might not have heard of is single-point incremental forming (SPIF), and its pretty cool.\nTo explore SPIF as a method for making small parts, [Russell Makes] gave it a go on a small CNC mill. The idea is pretty simple, and the video below makes it pretty clear whats going on. A forming tool is moved over a sheet metal blank thats held very securely to the mills table. The tool has no cutting edges, just a smooth, hard, spherical tip  [Russell] made his own by brazing a carbide ball to a piece of drill rod. The tool is driven slightly into the blank along the Z-axis, while simultaneously tracing out a tool path in the XY plane. The tool spins, but very slowly; ideally, the spindle speed is controlled to keep a single point of contact with the metal as the tool works around its tool path. The tool steps downward incrementally, drawing the metal down with it as it forms the desired shape.\n[Russell]s experiments were pretty promising. He started with titanium sheet, which behaved pretty well except for some galling thanks to lack of lubrication. Aluminum and stainless worked pretty well too, at least for simple hemispherical and cone shapes. More complex shapes proved trickier, but with time he was able to figure out the correct speeds and feeds to keep the metal intact. The amount of tension built up in the metal is impressive, though, and is especially evident when cutting the finished part free from the blank.\nCould this work with a hobbyist-grade machine? Possibly, but wed be afraid that the forces involved might be a bit much for light-duty machines, especially in the Z-axis. And its a slow process, so its probably only good for one-offs and low-volume work. Once youve got a prototype, die stamping might be a more efficient way to go.\n\n", "title": "\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5\uff08SPIF\uff09\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5c0f\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u4ed8\u52a0\u7684\u52a0\u5de5\u3068\u524a\u9664\u7684\u52a0\u5de5\u306b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u300c\u5f62\u6210\u300d\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u5897\u52a0\u5f62\u6210\uff08SPIF\uff09\u3068\u3044\u3046\u624b\u6cd5\u306f\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u677f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306aCNC\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5\uff08SPIF\uff09\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5c0f\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5c0f\u578bCNC\u30df\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u5f62\u6210\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5", "\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5\uff08SPIF\uff09\u306b\u3088\u308b\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u5f62\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3055", "\u4f4e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u88fd\u9020\u5411\u3051\u306e\u5358\u70b9\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5"]}

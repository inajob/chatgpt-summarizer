Well, depending on the contents of your parts bin, you might be able to use [Veyniac]s Pico-Audio-Interface as a free (and libre! Its GPL3.0) sound capture device.\nIn the projects Reddit thread, [Veyniac] describes needing audio input for his homemade synth, but having no budget. Necessity being the mother of invention, rather than beg borrow or steal a device with a working sound card, he hacked together this lovely device. It shows up as a USB Audio Class 2.0 device so should work with just about anything, and offers 12-bit resolution and 4x oversampling to try and deal with USB noise with its 2-channel, 44.1 kHz sample rate.\nAside from the Pico, all you need is an LM324 op-amp IC and a handful of resistors and capacitors  [Veyniac] estimates about $10 to purchase the whole BOM. He claims that the captured audio sounds okay in his use, but cant guarantee it will\u00a0 be for anyone else, noise being the fickle beast that it is. We figure that sounding Okay has got to be pretty good, given that you usually get what you pay for  and again, [Veyniac] did build this in a cave with a box of scraps. Well, except for the cave part. Probably.\nWhile the goal here was not to rival a commercial USB sound card, we have seen projects to do that. Were quite grateful to [Omadeira] for the tip, because this really is a hack. If you, too, want a share of our undying gratitude (which is still worth its weight in gold, despite fluctuations in the spot price of precious metals), send in a tip of your own."}

Even today, its still in demand as a chiptune synth. [gavinlyons] decided to take a breadbox-style C64 and mod it to be a more dedicated synth platform, creating what he calls the Cyanodore 6.\nThe build starts by equipping the C64 with MIDI via a C-LAB interface cartridge. Software is loaded on to the C64 via a readily-available SD2ISEC converter, which lets the retro computer run off SD cards. The original SID was removed and replaced with an ARMSID emulator instead, giving the rig stereo output with some custom wiring. Four potentiometers were also added to control various synth parameters by wiring them into the C64s two joystick ports.\u00a0There are a variety of synth programs that can run on the C64, with [gavinlyons] noting CynthCart, STATION64, and MicroRhythm as popular choices.\u00a0Other nifty mods include the keyboard illumination, tube preamp, and integrated 7 LCD screen.\nIf youre looking to start using your C64 as a performance instrument, this build is an excellent starting point. Weve seen other neat builds in this area before, too. Its got just about everything youll need on stage. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\"Cyanodore 6: C64\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308bMOD\"", "body": "Commodore 64\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3042\u308bCyanodore 6\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002MIDI\u3084SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u51fa\u529b\u306a\u3069\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7167\u660e\u3084\u30d7\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3001\u6db2\u6676\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"Cyanodore 6: C64\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308bMOD\"", "\"\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2MOD: MIDI\u3068ARMSID\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305fCyanodore 6\"", "\"C64\u306e\u9032\u5316\u5f62: \u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aCyanodore 6\"", "\"Cyanodore 6\u3067\u6f14\u594f\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3088\u3046\uff01C64\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306b\u6539\u9020\"", "\"C64\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027: Cyanodore 6\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\""]}

In the video after the break [365 Robots] takes us through the build process of a closed-loop motor with a custom optical encoder.\nThe motor, an axial flux design, uses a stack of 0.2mm PCBs with wedge shaped coils clamped in a 3D printed body. Its similar to some of the other PCB motors weve featured, but what really sets this build apart is its custom optical encoder, which was a project in its own right. The 4-bit absolute position encoder uses IR LEDs to shine through an PCB disc with concentric gray code copper encoder rings onto IR receivers. This works because FR4, the composite material used in PCBs doesnt block IR light.\nThe motors body was printed from ABS to withstand the heat during operation. [365 Robots] didnt skimp on the testing either, creating a 3D printed closed-loop test stand with load cell and Arduino. Like other PCB motors it produces very little torque, roughly 2% of a typical NEMA17 stepper motor. Even so, the engineering behind this project remains impressive.\n\n\n", "title": "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3068\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u5149\u5b66\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5b8c\u5168\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u5149\u5b66\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "PCB\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3068IR\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u624b\u9806", "ABS\u7d20\u6750\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

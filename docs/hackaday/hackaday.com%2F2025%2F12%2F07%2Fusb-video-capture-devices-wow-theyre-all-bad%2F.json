The results were actually quite varied, but almost universally bad. They all worked, but they also brought unpleasant artifacts and side effects when it came to the final results. Sure, the analog source isnt always the highest quality, but could it really be this hard to digitize a VHS tape?\n\nThe best results for digitizing VHS came from an old Sony device that was remarkably easy to use on a more modern machine.\nIt turns out theres an exception to all the disappointment: the Sony Digital Video Media Converter (DVMC) is a piece of vintage hardware released in 1998 that completely outperformed the other devices [VWestlife] tested. There is a catch, but its a small one. More on that in a moment.\nUnlike many other capture methods, the DVMC has a built-in time base corrector that stabilizes analog video signals by buffering them and correcting any timing errors that would cause problems like jitter or drift. This is a feature one wouldnt normally find on budget capture devices, but [VWestlife] says the Sony DVMC can be found floating around on eBay for as low as 20 USD. It even has composite and S-Video inputs.\nFor an old device, [VWestlife] says using the DVMC was remarkably smooth. It needed no special drivers, defaults to analog input mode, and can be powered over USB. That last one may sound trivial, but it means theres no worry about lacking some proprietary wall adapter with an oddball output voltage.\nThe catch? It isnt really a USB device, and requires a FireWire (IEEE-1394) port in order to work. But if thats not a deal-breaker, it does a fantastic job.\nSo if youre looking to digitize older analog media, [VWestlife] says it might be worth heading to eBay and digging up a used Sony DVMC. But if one wants to get really serious about archiving analog media, capturing RF signals direct from the tape head is where its at.\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip!\n", "title": "- VHS\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aUSB\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "VWestlife\u304c\u53e4\u3044USB\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3002Sony DVMC\u304c\u6700\u3082\u512a\u308c\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- VHS\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aUSB\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- Sony DVMC\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u3051\u308c\u3069\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306aVHS\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u5b89\u5b9a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u7c21\u5358\u64cd\u4f5c\u306eSony DVMC\u304c\u4ed6\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u7406\u7531", "- VHS\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

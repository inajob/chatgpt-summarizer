But we thought the results of his card-edge connector restoration on a CGA video card from the early 80s was pretty slick, and worth keeping in mind for other applications.\nThe back story is that [Adrian], of Digital Basement YouTube fame, came across an original IBM video card from the early days of the IBM-PC. The card was unceremoniously dumped, probably due to the badly corroded pins on the card-edge bus connector. The damage appeared to be related to a leaking battery  the corrosion had that sickly look that seems to only come from the guts of batteries  leading him to try cleaning the formerly gold-plated pins. He chose naval jelly rust remover for the job; for those unfamiliar with this product, its mostly phosphoric acid mixed with thickeners and is used as a rust remover.\nThe naval jelly certainly did the trick, but left the gold-plated pins a little worse for the wear. Getting them back to their previous state wasnt on the table, but protecting them with a thin layer of solder was easy enough. [Adrian] used liquid rosin flux and a generous layer of 60:40 solder, which was followed by removing the excess with desoldering braid. That worked great and got the pins on both sides of the board into good shape.\n[Adrian] also mentioned a friend who recommended using toilet paper to wick up excess solder, but sadly he didnt demonstrate that method. Sounds a little sketchy, but maybe well give it a try. As for making this more HASL-like, maybe heating up the excess solder with an iron and blasting the excess off with some compressed air would be worth a try.\n\n", "title": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eCGA\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306eCGA\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u4fee\u5fa9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u306b\u306f\u3001\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u306b\u306f\u8150\u98df\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u78e8\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3084\u534a\u7530\u4ed8\u3051\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002NAVAL JELLY\u9306\u53d6\u308a\u5264\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u3053\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u884c\u3044\u300160:40\u306e\u534a\u753d\u306a\u3069\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eCGA\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u8150\u98df\u3057\u305f\u91d1\u30e1\u30c3\u30ad\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ca\u30d0\u30eb\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8150\u98df\u9664\u53bb\u306e\u52b9\u679c", "\u30ea\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30ed\u30b8\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f59\u5270\u306f\u3093\u3060\u5438\u3044\u53d6\u308a\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

But we thought the results of his card-edge connector restoration on a CGA video card from the early 80s was pretty slick, and worth keeping in mind for other applications.\nThe back story is that [Adrian], of Digital Basement YouTube fame, came across an original IBM video card from the early days of the IBM-PC. The card was unceremoniously dumped, probably due to the badly corroded pins on the card-edge bus connector. The damage appeared to be related to a leaking battery  the corrosion had that sickly look that seems to only come from the guts of batteries  leading him to try cleaning the formerly gold-plated pins. He chose naval jelly rust remover for the job; for those unfamiliar with this product, its mostly phosphoric acid mixed with thickeners and is used as a rust remover.\nThe naval jelly certainly did the trick, but left the gold-plated pins a little worse for the wear. Getting them back to their previous state wasnt on the table, but protecting them with a thin layer of solder was easy enough. [Adrian] used liquid rosin flux and a generous layer of 60:40 solder, which was followed by removing the excess with desoldering braid. That worked great and got the pins on both sides of the board into good shape.\n[Adrian] also mentioned a friend who recommended using toilet paper to wick up excess solder, but sadly he didnt demonstrate that method. Sounds a little sketchy, but maybe well give it a try. As for making this more HASL-like, maybe heating up the excess solder with an iron and blasting the excess off with some compressed air would be worth a try.\n\n"}

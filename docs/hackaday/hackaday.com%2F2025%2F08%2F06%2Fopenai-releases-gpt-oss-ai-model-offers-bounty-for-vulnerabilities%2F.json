This is their first such open release, and its with a model whose features and capabilities compare favorably to some of their hosted services.\nOpenAI have partnered with ollama for the launch which makes onboarding ridiculously easy. ollama is an open source, MIT-licensed project for installing and running local LLMs, but theres no real tie-in to that platform. The models are available separately: gpt-oss-20b can run within 16 GB of memory, and the larger and more capable gpt-oss-120b requires 80 GB. OpenAI claims the smaller model is comparable to their own hosted o3-mini reasoning model, and the larger model outperforms it. Both support features like tool use (such as web browsing) and more.\nLLMs that can be downloaded and used offline are nothing new, but a couple things make this model release a bit different from others. One is that while OpenAI have released open models such as Whisper (a highly capable speech-to-text model), this is actually the first LLM they have released in such a way.\nThe other notable thing is this release coincides with a bounty challenge for finding novel flaws and vulnerabilities in gpt-oss-20b. Does ruining such a model hold more appeal to you than running it? If so, good news because theres a total of $500,000 to be disbursed. But theres no time to waste; submissions need to be in by August 26th, 2025."}

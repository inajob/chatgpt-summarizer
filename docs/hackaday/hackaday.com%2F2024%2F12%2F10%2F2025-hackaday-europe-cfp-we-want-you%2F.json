Or at least to Hackaday Europe, which will be taking place March 15th and 16th in Berlin, Germany.\nTickets aren\u2019t on sale yet, but we know a way that you can get in for free.\nCall for Participation\nWhat makes Hackaday Europe special? Well, it\u2019s you! We\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re opening up our call for talks right now, and we can\u2019t wait to hear what you have to say. Speakers of course get in free, but the real reason that you want to present is whom you\u2019re presenting to.\nThe Hackaday audience is interested, inquisitive, and friendly. If you have a tale of hardware, firmware, or software derring-do that would only really go over with a Hackaday crowd, this is your chance. We have slots open for shorter 20-minute talks as well as longer 40-minute ones, so whether you\u2019ve got a quick hack or you want to take a deep dive, we\u2019ve got you covered. We especially love to hear from new voices, so if you\u2019ve never given a talk about your projects before, we\u2019d really encourage you to apply!\n\nHackaday Europe, the Badge, and the SAOs\nIf youre not familiar with Hackaday Europe, its a gathering of 350 folks for a ridiculously fun weekend of talks, badge hacking, music, and everything else that goes with it. Saturday the 15th is the big day, and Sunday is a half-day of brunch, lightning talks, and showing off the badge hacks from the day before. And if you\u2019re in town on Friday the 14th, we\u2019ll be going out in the evening for drinks and dinner, location TBA.\nWe\u2019ll be re-spinning the 2024 Supercon SAO badge, which was all about the Supercon Add-Ons. (Can anyone think up a Hackaday-Europe-themed backronym: \u201cSpree Add Ons\u201d?) The badge was an inspiration for many stateside Supercon attendees to dip their toes into the warm waters of small badgelet designs, and we\u2019re hoping to bring the same to the Continent. Additionally, there are two prototyping \u201cpetals\u201d that you can hack on during the event, even if you didn\u2019t make anything beforehand. And of course, there\u2019s always hacking the firmware.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! We also ran a contest for pre-Supercon SAO designs, and the top three designs will be in your schwag bags at Hackaday Europe. Yes, this means that every attendee will be receiving a functional plug-in multimeter, etch-a-sketch, and blinky wavy-arm-art-thing. These are among the most creative and fun SAOs that we\u2019ve ever seen, and now you too can have one!\nSee you There!\nAgain, tickets aren\u2019t on sale yet, but we\u2019re opening the green-room door to those who want to present first. Take the next few weeks to firm up an outline and get your talk proposal in to us before January 14th. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019re up to!"}

This time, there are no plugs and no batteries. And although its crank-powered, it can run on its own with the flip of a switch. How? With a supercapacitor, of course.\nThe crank handle is connected a 50 RPM motor that acts as a generator, producing the voltage necessary to both power the train and charge up the supercapacitor. As youll see in the video below, [Peter] only has to move the train back and forth about two or three times before hes able to flip the switch and watch it run between the gem mine and the cliff by itself.\nThe supercapacitor also lights up the gem mine to show off the toiling dwarfs, and theres a couple of reed switches at either end of the track and a relay that handles the auto-reverse capability. Be sure to stick around to the second half of the video where [Peter] shows how he built this entire thing  the box, the layout, and the circuit.\nWant to see more of [Peter]s trains and other work? Here you go.\n\n", "title": "\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30df\u30cb\u9244\u9053\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8", "body": "Peter Waldraff\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u5217\u8eca\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3084\u96fb\u6c60\u306f\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u3001\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b8\u30a7\u30e0\u9271\u5c71\u3084\u65ad\u5d16\u9593\u3092\u81ea\u5f8b\u3057\u3066\u8d70\u884c\u3057\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30df\u30cb\u9244\u9053\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8", "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u5217\u8eca", "50 RPM\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u9271\u5c71\u3092\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306b\u3088\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u9006\u8d70\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u5c0f\u578b\u5217\u8eca"]}

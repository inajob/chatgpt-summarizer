You either have to plug it into an iPhone or iPad directly, or an iPhone charger using a special adapter. Its a bit below Apples usual seamless best. [Handy Bear] got around this fuss by building their own Apple Pencil dock.\nThe concept is simple. At its heart, its not dissimilar from a regular pen holder. It consists of a 3D printed round base filled with quick cement for heft. The base weighs almost a pound, and has a cork base so it sits nicely on a desk. A Lightning charge cable is fed into the base of the device, with the Apple Pencil adapter permanently fitted. All one has to do is remove the cap from the Apple Pencil, slot it into the adapter, and place the cap in the storage hole provided. The base then keeps the device charged, upright, and ready for use.\nIts not a complicated build, but it solves a fundamental problem with the Apple Pencil. Its hard to imagine fancy-schmancy creatives are leaving these things just floating around on their desks with cables going everywhere; youd think Apple would be selling a $99 dock for these by now. Instead, its up to the DIYers and the aftermarket.\nYou might also consider some high-end mods to your Apple Pencil for greater finesse.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eApple Pencil\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u53ce\u7d0d\u3092\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01", "body": "Apple Pencil\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u4e0d\u4fbf\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u91cd\u308a\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3001Apple Pencil\u3092\u5145\u96fb\u3057\u3001\u53ce\u7d0d\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u4e0a\u3067\u3054\u3061\u3083\u3054\u3061\u3083\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eApple Pencil\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u53ce\u7d0d\u3092\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01", "Apple Pencil\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u56f0\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u91cd\u3055\u3068\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305fApple Pencil\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30c3\u30af", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u4e0a\u3067Apple Pencil\u3092\u7dba\u9e97\u306b\u5145\u96fb\uff06\u53ce\u7d0d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u9ad8\u7d1a\u306aApple Pencil\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3082\u8003\u3048\u3066\u307f\u3066\u306f\uff1f"]}

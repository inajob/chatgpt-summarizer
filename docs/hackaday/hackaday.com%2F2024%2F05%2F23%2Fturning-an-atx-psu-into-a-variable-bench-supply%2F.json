If youre enterprising and creative, though, you can create your own bench supply with tons of features, and it doesnt have to break the bank either. Do what [Maker Y] did\u2014grab an ATX supply and get building!\nATX power supplies work as a great basis for a bench power supply. They have 12 volt, 3.3 volt, and 5 volt rails, and they can supply a ton of current for whatever you might need. [Maker Y] decided to break out these rails on banana plugs for ease of access, and fused them for safety, too. But the build doesnt stop there. [Maker Y] also added a buck-boost converter to provide a variable voltage output from 1 to 30 volts for added flexibility. As a nice final touch, the rig also features a pair of USB A ports compatible with Quick Charge 3.0, for keeping smart devices charged while working in the lab.\n[Caelestis Workshop] also designed a fully enclosed version if you prefer that style. Check it out on Instructables.\nNo matter which way you go, its a pretty simple build, with a bunch of off-the-shelf parts tossed together in a 3D printed housing. Ultimately, though, its got more functionality than a lot of cheap off-the-shelf bench supplies. You can build it just about anywhere on Earth where you can get cheap eBay parts via post.\n"}

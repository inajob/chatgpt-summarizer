If youre enterprising and creative, though, you can create your own bench supply with tons of features, and it doesnt have to break the bank either. Do what [Maker Y] did\u2014grab an ATX supply and get building!\nATX power supplies work as a great basis for a bench power supply. They have 12 volt, 3.3 volt, and 5 volt rails, and they can supply a ton of current for whatever you might need. [Maker Y] decided to break out these rails on banana plugs for ease of access, and fused them for safety, too. But the build doesnt stop there. [Maker Y] also added a buck-boost converter to provide a variable voltage output from 1 to 30 volts for added flexibility. As a nice final touch, the rig also features a pair of USB A ports compatible with Quick Charge 3.0, for keeping smart devices charged while working in the lab.\n[Caelestis Workshop] also designed a fully enclosed version if you prefer that style. Check it out on Instructables.\nNo matter which way you go, its a pretty simple build, with a bunch of off-the-shelf parts tossed together in a 3D printed housing. Ultimately, though, its got more functionality than a lot of cheap off-the-shelf bench supplies. You can build it just about anywhere on Earth where you can get cheap eBay parts via post.\n", "title": "ATX\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "ATX\u96fb\u6e90\u306f\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u57fa\u306b\u306a\u308b\u300212V\u30013.3V\u30015V\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3002\u53ef\u5909\u51fa\u529b\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u683c\u5b89eBay\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["ATX\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30e9\u30dc\u3067\u6d3b\u8e8d\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u53ef\u5909\u96fb\u5727\u3084USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\uff01DIY\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u304c\u4eba\u6c17", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30cf\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u4ed8\u304d\uff01\u304a\u624b\u8efd\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90"]}

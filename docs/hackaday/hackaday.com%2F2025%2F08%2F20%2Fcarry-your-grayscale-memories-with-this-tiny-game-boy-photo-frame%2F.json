Since the 0.85 TFT display would be wasted on multi-megapixel images, [Raphael] has dedicated this project to images from the Game Boy Camera.\nIts a good fit: the tiny square display has a resolution of 128 pixels per side, while the Game Boy Camera produces files measuring 128 x 112. That allows for pixel-perfect rendering of the grainy images from everyones favorite early digicam with just a little letter boxing.\nWhile perfect for all your on-the-go Game Boy slideshow needs, an enclosure might be a good idea for hauling around that battery.\nThe brains of the operation are an RP2040, provided via the RP2040-zero breakout from Waveshare. Since everything is through-hole or on breakouts, this wouldnt be a bad project for a beginner solderer.\nSince it would make no sense not to have this tiny unit to be portable, power is provided with a 503035 LiPo pouch on the back. Its only 500 mAh, but this device isnt going to be chugging power, so wed expect a reasonable runtime.\nAlas, no link cable functionality is currently included, and files must be transferred via PC. Images are saved to the Picos flash memory, and [Rapha\u00ebl] says any format from any Game Boy Printer emulator will work, provided it has a four-color palette. The flash memory on the chip has room for 540 images, which seems like more than enough. Regardless of the novelty of the tiny screen and retro format, nobody wants to see that many holiday snaps in one go.\nThe Game Boy Camera has been popular with hackers literally for decades now, and weve seen it everywhere from wedding photo booths to the heart of a custom DSLR,\u00a0and even on Zoom calls."}

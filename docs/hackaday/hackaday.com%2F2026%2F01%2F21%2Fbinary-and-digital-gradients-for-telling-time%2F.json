[typo] promises a clever adaptation to the binary format, and it promises a more usable display. Using a combination of both traditional binary and digital gradients creates a usable and yet still nerdy fun clock.\n[typo]\u2019s clock fits the traditional binary counting method with the hours on the left side of its face. On the other hand, its right side presents a lighting gradient depending on the completion of the hour. While this is simple in principle, [typo] chose to correct what many don\u2019t consider when deploying visual gradients. The human eye doesn\u2019t see everything exactly as it is, which creates a rough logarithmic curve that gets corrected for in the binary/digital hybrid clock.\nIf you want something more mobile and still have that smidge of difficult time telling you, check out this minimalist wrist watch!\n\n"}

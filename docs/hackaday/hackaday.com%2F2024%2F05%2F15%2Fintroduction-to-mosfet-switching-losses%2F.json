Although its main advantage is its high power efficiency, MOSFETs are not ideal switches with a perfect on or off state. Understanding the three main sources of switching losses is crucial when designing with MOSFETs, with a recent All About Circuits article by [Robert Keim] providing a primer on the subject.\nAs its a primer, the subtreshold mode of MOSFET modes of operation is omitted, leaving the focus on the linear (ohmic) mode where the MOSFETs drain-source is conducting, but with a resistance thats determined by the gate voltage. In the saturated mode the drain-source resistance is relatively minor (though still relevant), but the turn-on time (RDS(on)) before this mode is reached is where major switching losses occur. Simply switching faster is not a solution, as driving the gate incurs its own losses, leaving the circuit designer to carefully balance the properties of the MOSET.\nFor those interested in a more in-depth study of MOSFETs in e.g. power supplies, there are many articles on the subject, such as this article (PDF) from Texas Instruments.", "title": "MOSFET\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u640d\u5931\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58", "body": "MOSFET\u306fCPU\u3084\u96fb\u529b\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306a\u3069\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u7528\u9014\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u9ad8\u3044\u96fb\u529b\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u30aa\u30f3\u307e\u305f\u306f\u30aa\u30d5\u3068\u3044\u3046\u72b6\u614b\u306b\u306f\u306a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u640d\u5931\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7406\u89e3\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002Robert Keim\u6c0f\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u304c\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["MOSFET\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u640d\u5931\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58", "MOSFET\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u640d\u5931\u306e\u7406\u89e3", "MOSFET\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u6539\u5584\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u8981\u70b9", "MOSFET\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u96fb\u6e90\u56de\u8def\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bMOSFET\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u6d3b\u7528"]}

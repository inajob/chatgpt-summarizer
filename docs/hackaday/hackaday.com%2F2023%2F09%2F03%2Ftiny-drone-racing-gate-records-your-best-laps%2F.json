If youre just practicing with tiny drones in your home though, you might not be so well equipped. You might want to build something like this tiny FPV drone racing gate from [ProfessorBoots] to help keep track of laptimes while youre training.\nThe build uses ultrasonic range sensors to detect when an object passes through the gate. The gate itself consists of a ring of addressable LEDs in strip form. The gate switches from green to red as a visual indicator of a drone passing through the gate. Theres also a small 2.4-inch touch screen that displays laptimes and enables the gate to be configured quickly and easily. The gate also serves up a webpage on the local network for viewing laptimes in a browser.\nIt does bear noting that at this stage, its primarily a practice tool. The gate doesnt currently work for proper competitions, as it has no way of determining\u00a0which drone might be flying through the gate at any one time.\nIts not the first time weve seen a TinyWhoop drone, either. Video after the break.\n\n"}

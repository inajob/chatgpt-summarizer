Scientists have now found a new source of our days getting longer  climate change.\nYou may have already been aware that the length of the day on Earth has been getting longer over time due to the drag exerted on our planet by our friendly neighborhood Moon. Many other factors come into play though, including the Earths own mass distribution. As the Earth warms and polar caps melt, the water redistributes to the Earths equator causing it to slow more rapidly.\nIn the worst-case scenario, RCP8.5, it would result in climate-related effects to planetary rotational velocity even larger than those caused by lunar tides. Under that scenario, the earth would probably be a less pleasant place to live in many other ways, but at least youd have a little more time in your day.\nWhile were talking about time, we wonder what ever happened to getting rid of Daylight Savings in the US? If you long for a simpler time, perhaps you should take up repairing mechanical watches and clocks?"}

But in this case, it is [Jeandre Groenewalds] 3D-printed shoe design called Sloffies. The shoes use TPU, and the matching package prints in PLA. Of course, you have to pick the size to fit your feet, and theres an OpenSCAD file that allows you to customize the strap.\nUnlike some 3D apparel weve seen, these look like a commerical product. Of course, the cool product packaging doesnt hurt any. Are they comfortable? We dont know, but our guess is it is no worse than other similar shoes that are made of one material.\n\nYou need to get the infill settings right, so there is a small test piece you can use for tuning. We arent sure what you are optimzing for, though, but at least you can see how the material will flex before you print an entire shoe.\nWeve seen commercial shoe printing, but not the entire shoe and packaging. If you are interested in creating your own designs, you dont have to start from scratch."}

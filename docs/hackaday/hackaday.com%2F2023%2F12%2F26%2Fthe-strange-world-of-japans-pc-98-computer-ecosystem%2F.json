This led to a sort of parallel universe in which NECs PC-9800 series (PC-98) was the dominant personal computer, including its NEC \u00b5PD7220 display controller with its 4096-color palette. These computer systems led to a graphics style that persists to today, along with a whole ecosystem of games and applications that never left the PC-98. In an article by [Biz Davis] this software ecosystem, its art style and their lasting impact is explored.\nScreenshots from X-Girl, a PC-98 game from 1994.\nAlthough the NEC PC-9800 series of computers was primarily focused on Japanese businesses with its release in the early 1980s, it found itself adopted for educational and hobby purposes as well. During the 1980s and early 1990s they faced little opposition from IBM PCs and clones, despite them all being x86-based systems running DOS. It wasnt until the early 1990s that mostly US companies began to explicitly design computers to work for the Japanese market, leading to a gradual decline of the PC-9800 series PCs in the market.\nDespite the last PC-98 system having been released in 2000  with the last systems running some flavor of Windows  these systems and the software for them isnt just a unique time capsule of this part of Japans history, but continues to see new software releases to this day. If you wish to experience this software for yourself, a number of open source PC-9800 emulators are available, including the nyan-tastic Neko Project II.\nTop image: PC-9801 system.

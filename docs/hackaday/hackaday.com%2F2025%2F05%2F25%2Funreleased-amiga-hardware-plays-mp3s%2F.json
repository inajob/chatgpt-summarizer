Developed in the late 80s and early 90s, it rose to prominence during the Napster/Limewire era of the early 00s and became the de facto standard for digital music, but not all computers in these eras could play this filetype. This includes the Amigas of the early 90s, with one rare exception: this unreleased successor to the A3000 with a DSP chip, which now also has the software to play back these digital tunes.\nThe AA3000, developed as a prototype by Amiga, was never released to the general public. Unlike the original A3000 this one would have included a digital signal processing chip from ATT called the DSP3210 which would have greatly enhanced its audio capabilities. A few prototype boards did make it out into the hands of the public, and the retrocomputing scene has used them to develop replicas of these rare machines. [Wrangler] used one to then develop the software needed for the MPEG layer 2 and 3 decoder using this extra hardware, since the original Amiga 3000 was not powerful enough on its own to play these files back.\nIf you want to follow along with the community still developing for this platform theres a form post with some more detail for this specific build (although you may need to translate from German). [Wrangler] additionally points out that there are some limitations with this implementation as well, so you likely wont get Winamp-level performance with this system, but for the Amiga fans out there its an excellent expansion of this computers capabilities nonetheless.\nThanks to [Andy] for the tip!\n\n"}

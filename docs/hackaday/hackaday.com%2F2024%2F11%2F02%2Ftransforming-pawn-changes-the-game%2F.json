Now, the magic of 3D printing has allowed [Works By Design] to change the game by making pawns that can automatically transform themselves into queens.\nInspired by a CGI transforming chess piece designed by [Polyfjord], [Works By Design] wanted to make a pawn that could transform itself exist in the real world. What started as a chonky setup with multiple springs and a manually-actuated mechanism eventually was whittled down to a single spring, some pins, and four magnets as vitamins for the 3D printed piece.\nWe always love getting a peek into the trial-and-error process of a project, especially for something with such a slick-looking final product. Paired with a special chess board with steel in the ends, the magnets in the base activate the transformation sequence when they reach the opposite end.\nAfter you print your own, how about playing chess against the printer? Wed love to see a version machined from metal too.\nThanks to [DjBiohazard] on Discord for the tip!\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u5909\u5f62\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u99d2\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u99d2\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u5909\u5f62\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u99d2\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u99d2\u304c\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u5909\u8eab\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\uff01\u5909\u5f62\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u99d2\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u78c1\u77f3\u306e\u529b\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u99d2\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u5bfe\u5c40\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

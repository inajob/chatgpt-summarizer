While the results were equivocal, it was still an amazing piece of engineering and spacefaring, one that [Marb] has recreated with this Earth-based version of the famed Viking Labeled Release experiment.\nThe Labeled Release experimental design was based on the fact that many metabolic processes result in the evolution of carbon dioxide gas, which should be detectable by inoculating a soil sample with a nutrient broth laced with radioactive carbon-14. For this homage to the LR experiment, [Marb] eschewed the radioactive tracer, instead looking for a relative increase in the much lower CO2 concentration here on Earth. The test chamber is an electrical enclosure with a gasketed lid that holds a petri dish and a simple CO2 sensor module. Glands in the lid allow an analog for Martian regolith  red terrarium sand  and a nutrient broth to be added to the petri dish. Once the chamber was sterilized, or at least sanitized, [Marb] established a baseline CO2 level with a homebrew data logger and added his sample. Adding the nutrient broth  a solution of trypsinized milk protein, yeast extract, sugar, and salt  gives the bacteria in the regolith all the food they need, which increases the CO2 level in the chamber.\nMore after the break\n\n[Marb]s results are not surprising by any means, but thats hardly the point. This is just a demonstration of the concept of the LR experiment, one that underscores the difficulties of doing biochemistry on another planet and the engineering it took to make it happen. Compared to some of the instruments rolling around Mars today, the Viking experiments seem downright primitive, and the fact that they delivered even the questionable data they did is pretty impressive.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "1976\u5e74\u306e\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1aViking Labeled Release\u5b9f\u9a13\u306eEarth\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "\u30de\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u751f\u547d\u63a2\u3057\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u96c6\u307e\u308b\u3082\u3001\u65e2\u306b\u5b87\u5b99\u958b\u767a\u521d\u671f\u304b\u3089\u706b\u661f\u306b\u7740\u9678\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u53f7\u306e\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3002\u653e\u5c04\u602714C\u3092\u6dfb\u52a0\u3057CO2\u5206\u6790\u3059\u308bLR\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u5730\u7403\u7248\u3067\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u82e6\u52b4\u4f1d\u308f\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5049\u696d\u79f0\u8cdb\u3002", "titles": ["1976\u5e74\u306e\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1aViking Labeled Release\u5b9f\u9a13\u306eEarth\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u706b\u661fLR\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u6982\u5ff5\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9CO2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528", "\u706b\u661f\u306e\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u306e\u5075\u5bdf\uff1aViking Labeled Release\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u56f0\u96e3\u3055\u3068\u6311\u6226", "\u5316\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u56f0\u96e3\uff1a\u706b\u661f\u3068\u5730\u7403\u3067\u306e\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5fdc\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

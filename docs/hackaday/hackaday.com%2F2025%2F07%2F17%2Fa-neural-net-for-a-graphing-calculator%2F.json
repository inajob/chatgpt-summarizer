At the extreme end of the spectrum is [ExploratoryStudios]s Hermes Optimus Neural Net for a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.\nThis neural net is setup as an autocorrect system that can take four character inputs and match them to a library of twelve words. Thats not a lot, but were talking about a device with 24 kB of RAM, so the little machine is doing its best. Perhaps more interesting than any practical output is the puzzle solving involved in getting this to work within the memory constraints.\nThe neural net employs a feedforward neural network with a precisely calibrated 4-60-12 architecture and sigmoid activation functions. This leads to an approximate 85% accuracy being able to identify and correct the given target words. We appreciate the readout of the nets confidence as well which is something that seems to have gone out the window with many newer AI systems.\nWeve seen another TI-84 neural net for handwriting recognition, but is the current crop of AI still headed in the wrong direction?\n\n"}

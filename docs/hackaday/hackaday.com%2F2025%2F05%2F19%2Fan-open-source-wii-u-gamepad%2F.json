With that sort of reputation its not surprising that they dont release open-source drivers for their platforms, especially those like the Wii U with unique controllers that are difficult to emulate. This Wii U gamepad emulator seeks to bridge that gap.\nThe major issue with the Wii U compared to other Nintendo platforms like the SNES or GameCube is that the controller looks like a standalone console and behaves similarly as well, with its own built-in screen. Buying replacement controllers for this unusual device isnt straightforward either; outside of Japan Nintendo did not offer an easy path for consumers to buy controllers. This software suite, called Vanilla, aims to allow other non-Nintendo hardware to bridge this gap, bringing in support for things like the Steam Deck, the Nintendo Switch, various Linux devices, or Android smartphones which all have the touch screens required for Wii U controllers. The only other hardware requirement is that the device must support 802.11n 5 GHz Wi-Fi.\nAlthough the Wii U was somewhat of a flop commercially, it seems to be experiencing a bit of a resurgence among collectors, retro gaming enthusiasts, and homebrew gaming developers as well. Many games were incredibly well made and are still experiencing continued life on the Switch, and plenty of gamers are looking for the original experience on the Wii U instead. If youve somehow found yourself in the opposite position of owning of a Wii U controller but not the console, though, you can still get all the Wii U functionality back with this console modification.\nThanks to [Kat] for the tip!", "title": "\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii U\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "body": "\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306f\u8a34\u8a1f\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001Wii U\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cVanilla\u300d\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u975e\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u6a5f\u5668\u304cWii U\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii U\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "Wii U\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cVanilla\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067Wii U\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080Wii U\uff1aRetro\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "Wii U\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u6539\u9020\u6cd5"]}

It first gained attention in backpacking circles because of its high capacity for a reasonable weight, and since then has been selling like the proverbial hot cakes. Now Amazon have withdrawn it from their store over A potential safety or quality issue. The industrial imaging company Lumafield have taken a look at the power bank with a CT scanner, to find out why.\nAs you might imagine, the power bank is all battery inside, with pouch type lithium ion cells taking up all of the space. Immediately a clue appears as to why Amazon withdrew them, as the individual layers of the cells are misaligned, laying open a risk of failure. They also take a look at a set of earbuds from the same source and find something even more concerning  torn electrodes. Thus neither device can be regarded as safe, and the backpackers will have to haul around a little bit more in the future.\nYoull not find the Wrencher on a power bank, but you can be sure if you did, wed make sure there was an element of quality control at play. Meanwhile we feel slightly sorry for the branding executive responsible at Haribo, who we are guessing has had a bad day. Weve featured Lumafields work here before quite a few times, most recently looking at similar defects in 18650 cells.", "title": "- \u30cf\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u88fd\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u4e88\u671f\u305b\u306c\u4eba\u6c17\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "body": "\u30cf\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u304c\u5371\u967a\u6027\u304b\u3089Amazon\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u4e2d\u6b62\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u88fd\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u4e88\u671f\u305b\u306c\u4eba\u6c17\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u30a2\u30de\u30be\u30f3\u304c\u64a4\u56de\u3057\u305f\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3067\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- \u540c\u3058\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30e4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3082\u5371\u967a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u96fb\u6975\u304c\u767a\u898b", "- \u30cf\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u305f\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408"]}

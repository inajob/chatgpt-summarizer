The news hit me hard, and I moaned when I saw the headline; my wife, sitting next to me, thought for sure that my utterance meant someone had died. While she wasnt quite right, she wasnt wrong either, at least in my mind.\nAs soon as I got back to my desk I wrote up a short article on the end of Ingenuitys tenure as the only off-Earth flying machine  we like to have our readers hear news like this from Hackaday first if at all possible. To my surprise, a fair number of the comments that the article generated seemed to decry the anthropomorphization of technology in general and Ingenuity in particular, with undue harshness directed at what some deemed the overly emotional response by some of the NASA/JPL team members.\nGranted, some of the goodbyes in that video are a little cringe, but still, as someone who seems to easily and eagerly form attachments to technology, the disdain for an emotional response to the loss of Ingenuity perplexed me. That got me thinking about what role anthropomorphization might play in our relationship with technology, and see if theres maybe a reason  or at least a plausible excuse  for my emotional response to the demise of a machine.\n\nPart of the Crew\nTo be clear, when I use the term anthropomorphism here Im not referring to making machines look like humans, but rather to our tendency to develop emotional attachments to machines, as well as to act as if they have some level of awareness of their users and their creators. Theres a name for this: Tool anthropomorphism, or the assignment of human-like characteristics to tools and machines, is an area of scholarly research. In commonplace terms, when you sweet-talk a dodgy lawnmower so that itll start on the next pull, or say goodnight to the project on your workbench before giving up on it for the evening, youre engaging in tool anthropomorphism.\nTool anthropomorphism is nothing new; weve been assigning human characteristics to our machines for a long time, long enough that it makes me think there has to be some purpose to it. On the user side, I think anthropomorphism helps people relate to technology. An example of this might be when humans first started naming boats. Logically, theres no reason to give an inanimate object like a boat a name. But for members of a species as social and as strongly tribal as we are, it must have been much easier for them to get into a primitive boat and sail off into a dangerous ocean knowing that the vessel had a name. It probably would have made the boat seem less of a stranger and more like a member of the village, imbuing it with a personality that they could relate to.\nBeyond dispelling the otherness of a ship, naming it probably served another, more practical purpose. With a name  and possibly a face; many cultures did (and still do) adorn the prows of boats with facial features and eyes, to help the boat see where its taking them  its a lot more likely that the crew will take proper care of it. Even the simplest sailing vessels are technically complex systems, and getting to know their quirks and idiosyncrasies is crucial to survival. It also gives the crew someone to beseech when things are going wrong, to lavish praise upon when returning safely to shore, or to blame when things go wrong.\nOf course, none of this makes any difference to the boat, since it has no consciousness to perceive its own status or to consider the sailors entreaties one way or the other. So in purely rational terms, how the sailors think about their boat wont make the slightest difference to whether it sinks or floats. But thats not the point; its the sailors who are influenced by the anthropomorphization, not the vessel. Its a brain hack, really; act like the ship is a person worthy of love and slavish devotion, and youre more likely to do what it takes to keep her together and get you home. Break that faith, and things probably wont go the way you want them to.\nEven though theres always been a lot of superstition surrounding the ancient mariners and their ships, and understandably so given the risky nature of their trade, the purpose that anthropomorphism served back then applies to the user experience of technology all through the ages. The classic example of this, particularly for Americans, is with our cars. We spend so much time in our cars, often while having intense experiences, that its hard not to anthropomorphize them. Some of us give them names, and some even claim to know their vehicles personality quirks and what theyll do in certain situations. Well talk to it, ply it with loving words of encouragement when it acts up, and threaten it with the junkyard when it lets us down. I cant count the number of times Ive arrived safely at home after a long, dangerous drive in a blizzard or hurricane and taken the time to tenderly caress the dashboard of my truck and whisper a quiet word of thanks for deliverance.\nIs any of that rational? Of course not. The truck isnt listening. On the other hand, feeling connected to that inanimate machine, especially after going through a harrowing experience with it, is powerfully motivating to get to know everything about it, to see to its care and maintenance, and to make sure its in top shape for the next trip out. Anthropomorphizing a car  or a computer, a spacecraft, a house, or even a helicopter on another planet  serves the same purpose as naming a ship did all those ages ago. The technology may change, but its still the human brain thats getting hacked by seeing human characteristics where none exist, and the result is the same: a better, more productive relationship with machines.\nBack to the Drawing Board\nThe other place where I think our tendency to anthropomorphize technology pays dividends, and the one that probably concerns most Hackaday readers more directly, is in the creation of new technologies. As we all know, real innovation is generally a long, drawn-out process that starts with ideation and (hopefully) ends with something useful that never existed before. No matter whether its a mechanical, electrical, software, or a combination of all three, most projects are long, often painful slogs with too many dead ends and failures to count. Seeing that process through to the end is a hard thing to do, but personalizing the project somehow seems to make it easier.\nIf were thinking in strictly rational terms on difficult projects, the tenth or eleventh back to the drawing board moment would probably compel us to cut our losses and abandon the project. Sometimes we do just that, but other times well say something like, I cant do that, this project is my baby! Is it really? Nope, its just a collection of parts sitting on your bench. But somewhere along the line, probably without even realizing it, you started thinking of it as your offspring, with hopes and aspirations for what itll be when it grows up. Giving your project the characteristics of a child and seeing it as utterly dependent on you for survival is often enough to get you over the creative hump and see the project through to the end. If you have any doubt about the power of anthropomorphizing machines, a quick look at The Soul of a New Machine will probably be enough to convince you otherwise; would a team of otherwise rational engineers work 90-hour weeks to bring a minicomputer to life if they didnt at least partially think of it as a person?\nIm no psychologist, so I have no idea whether my ideas about the role of anthropomorphism of machines are even approximately correct. Then again, Im not a credentialed engineer either, yet I still do a pretty decent job figuring things out by the seats of my pants. And something tells me that thinking of machines in more human, more personal terms serves a purpose both in how we manage the often painful process of creation, as well as how we relate to the technology that others create. And if that means being saddened by the demise of a machine on Mars, Im OK with that.", "title": "\u300c\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u611f\u60c5\u7684\u306a\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u300d", "body": "NASA\u306e\u706b\u661f\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fcIngenuity\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u7d42\u4e86\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u611f\u60c5\u7684\u306a\u53cd\u5fdc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b\u3068\u3001\u4eba\u9593\u306f\u6a5f\u68b0\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u611f\u60c5\u7684\u306a\u675f\u7e1b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u50be\u5411\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u6280\u8853\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3057\u3001\u5275\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u6bb5\u3068\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u611f\u60c5\u7684\u306a\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u300d", "\u300c\u4eba\u9593\u5316\u73fe\u8c61\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u6027\u300d", "\u300c\u8239\u3068\u8eca\u306b\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u6280\u8853\u3078\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u3089\u3057\u3055\u300d", "\u300c\u5275\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u5316\u300d", "\u300c\u706b\u661f\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u7d42\u7109\u306b\u611f\u3058\u308b\u55aa\u5931\u611f\u300d"]}

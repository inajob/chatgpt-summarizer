Its also the beginning of yet another [Hyperspace Pirate] chemistry video thats both fascinating and unforgettable  this time introducing a considerable collection of urine, and the many uses of the urea in it, including its use for refrigeration.\nThe respective cooling effect of a variety of compounds in solution. (Credit: Hyperspace Pirate)\nAs icky as this may sound, it doesnt even rank in the top ten of quaint things people have historically done with urine, so extracting urea from it is rather benign. This is performed by adding sodium hydroxide to the starting component after heating, which creates gaseous ammonia (NH3) which was then condensed into its liquid (dissolved) form. In order to create the target compound  being ammonium nitrate  nitric acid (HNO3) had to be created first.\nFor this the older, but cheaper and easier Birkeland-Eyde process was used. This uses high-voltage electrical arcs to break down the nitrogen and oxygen in the air and cause the formation of nitric oxide (NO), that subsequently reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Running the NO2 through water then creates the desired HNO3, which can be combined with the ammonia solution to create ammonium nitrate. The resulting solution was then evaporated into solid ammonium nitrate, to use it in an aluminium cooling cylinder, with freshly added water.\nThis is the simplest way to use the cooling effect of such solutions (pictured), but the benefit of ammonium nitrate over the original urea seems minimal. The low efficiency of this cooling approach means that the next use of urine will involve a much more efficient vapor-absorption cycle, which were sure everyone is squeezing their legs together for in anticipation.\nWeve been covering the refrigeration experiments [Hyperspace Pirate] has been conducting for some time now.

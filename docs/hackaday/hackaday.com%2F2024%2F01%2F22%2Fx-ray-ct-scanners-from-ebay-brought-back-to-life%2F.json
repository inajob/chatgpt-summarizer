He has two small GE Explore Locus SP machines, and its a fantastic look into just what goes into these machines.\nCT scan of papyrus roll in a bamboo sheath.\nThese devices use a combination of X-rays and computer software to reconstruct an internal view of an object. To bring these machines back into service means not only getting the hardware to work correctly, but the software end (including calibration and error correcting) is just as important.\nThat means a lot of research, testing, and making do. For example, instead of an expensive calibration grid made from an array of tiny tungsten carbide beads, [Ahron] made do with a PCB laden with a grid of copper pads. The fab house might have scratched their heads a little on that one, but it worked just fine for his purposes and price was certainly right.\nScan of a foil Pok\u00e9mon card from inside a sealed package.\nTools like these enable all kinds of weird and wonderful projects of their own. So what can one do with such a machine? CT scanning can spot fake AirPods or enable deeper reverse engineering than a regular workshop is normally able to do.\nWhat else? Shown here is an old foil Pok\u00e9mon card, from an unopened package! [Ahron] coyly denies having a pet project of building a large enough dataset to try to identify cards without opening the packs. (Incidentally, if you just happen to have experience with supervised convolutional neural networks for pix2pix, he asks that you please reach out to him.)\nThe real power of CT scanning becomes more apparent if you take a look at the videos embedded below the page break. One is a scan of an acorn, [Ahron]s first successful scan. Another is an interesting scan of a papyrus roll in a bamboo sheath. Both of the videos are embedded below.\n\n\n", "title": "\"X\u7ddaCT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\"", "body": "X\u7ddaCT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u6539\u88c5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u3001\u683c\u5b89\u306ePCB\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u306f\u507d\u306eAirPods\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u308a\u3001\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"X\u7ddaCT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\"", "\"X\u7ddaCT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"\u30ab\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u30af\u30e2\u72b6\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\"", "\"CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3067\u672a\u958b\u5c01\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\"", "\"CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\""]}

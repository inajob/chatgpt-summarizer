[HeroTech] seems to have cracked the code with their Impossible Lightsaber its fully retractable, fully lit, and able to hit things (lightly), all while fitting into a replica prop handle.\nThe secret is well, theres more than one secret, here. The blade itself is made out of a magicians cane, which is a coil of plastic that can spring outwards on demand for magic tricks. Hidden inside of it is a strip of LED lights. Of course one strip of LEDs would not be omnidirectional, and the magicians cane is pretty floppy, but both of those problems are solved by the same idea: Ill try spinning. Thats a good trick.\nThe spin-stabilized blade holds up to being waved around much better, and apparently the gyroscopic forces it induces are actually lore-accurate.\u00a0(Who knew?) Of course fitting a motor to spin the blade, and another to winch it back in, along with the circuitry and batteries to drive them was no mean feat. Its impressive they fit it all inside the replica handle; even more impressive that they fit a speaker so this prop even makes the iconic sound effects. We always wanted to see a stage production of William Shakespeares Star Wars, and this gives us verily, a new hope.\n[HeroTech] isnt done yet while seemingly impossible, this lightsaber isnt perfect, as its not rugged enough for full dueling. Its also not easy to put together, and apparently cant handle the delicate attentions of airline baggage handlers. So ruggedization and a bit of design-for-assembly are on the table for the next version. Sadly the project is not open source; they are releasing the build files to subscribers only. Given how much work must have gone into iterating to get to this point, that is disappointing, but understandable. Everybody needs to make a living, after all.\nIf this project seems familiar, its because we featured a much-bulkier previous iteration last year. \nYou may prefer your lightsabers to match the movie version in effects instead of visuals; if thats the case, check out this saber that uses HHO to cut through a steel door.\n\n", "title": "\u5b8c\u5168\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30af\u300c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u300d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u52d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002LED\u3068\u56de\u8ee2\u5b89\u5b9a\u5316\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u52b9\u679c\u3082\u5099\u3048\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b8c\u5168\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30af\u300c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u300d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "\u30de\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u306e\u6756\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6620\u753b\u9b54\u6cd5\uff1a\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u5b89\u5b9a\u5316\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aLED\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u82e6\u52b4", "\u3042\u306e\u540d\u5834\u9762\u304c\u518d\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01\u97f3\u58f0\u52b9\u679c\u4ed8\u304d\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "\u6b21\u306a\u308b\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85\uff1a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30bb\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3068\u958b\u767a\u306e\u9032\u5c55"]}

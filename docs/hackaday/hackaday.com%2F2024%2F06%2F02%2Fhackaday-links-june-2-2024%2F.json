We feel you on that; the light pollution here was too much for decent viewing, and it had been too long a day to make a drive into the deep dark of the countryside survivable. But fear not  the sunspot that raised all the ruckus back at the beginning of May has survived the trip across the far side of the sun and will reappear in early June, mostly intact and ready for business. At least sunspot AR3664 seems like its still a force to be reckoned with, having cooked off an X-class flare last Tuesday just as it was coming around from the other side of the Sun. Whether 3664 will be able to stir up another G5 geomagnetic storm remains to be seen, but since it fired off an X-12 flare while it was around the backside, you never know. Your best bet to stay informed in these trying times is the indispensable Dr. Tamitha Skov.\n\n\nBack here on our soon-to-be-incinerated planet, you know weve reached the peak of the AI hype curve when you see something like AI competitive thermal paste being hawked. Thats the marketing niche Cooler Master has staked out for its new Cyrofuze 5 thermal paste, which is supposed to somehow make your computer smarter by keeping it cooler? Or maybe not; its not really clear from Cooler Masters Chinese website for the product what the AI advantages are, and sadly the Cryofuze 5 line doesnt seem to be offered on the US site. Which is a shame, because the new smartening goo comes in six designer colors that for all the world look like a Bob Ross palette  it that alizarin crimson and phthalo blue? Who in their right mind wouldnt want a chance to color coordinate their thermal grease while simultaneously making their machine more AI competitive?\nSpeaking of AI, weve covered a lot of interactions between humans and autonomous vehicles in this column, with most of them tending toward the violent. But weve finally got a more heartwarming interaction to report, where a pedestrian helped a stuck delivery vehicle out of a tough spot. The truck, which is really only a little bigger than those munchie-delivering robots that ply college campuses, maneuvered itself onto a driveway sporting a pair of speed bumps spaced almost exactly as far apart as the vehicles wheelbase. The front wheels made it over the first bump, but when it came time to climb both obstacles at the same time, the poor little truck just couldnt manage it. The fact that the bumps were a significant fraction of the wheel diameter on the tiny truck likely didnt help, but thankfully a pedestrian took pity and gave the little fella a push. The bots rear wheels seemed to be having trouble clearing the last bump, too; the video cuts off too soon to tell, but well give it the benefit of the doubt.\nVictim blame is generally in bad form, but if you dont even bother to change the default password, can you really call a cyberattack a break-in? Thats the question we have after learning of an alarming increase in cyberattacks against public infrastructure in the US, including public water supplies in Pennsylvania and Texas. While the separate attacks resulted in no damage to the physical plants, the article links to a report listing some attacks that did result in damage, including an intentional release of 800,000 liters of sewage in Australia in 2000.\nAnd finally, speaking of cybersecurity, if youve ever procrastinated on keeping your OS patched, what happened when a Windows XP machine was put online with no protection should spur you into action. YouTuber Eric Parker put an XP machine on the raw internet  no router, no firewall, and no anti-malware software. It only took about ten minutes for the first signs of infection to appear, and things went downhill pretty fast from there. Parker notes that the same setup on a Windows 7 machine resulted in no major malware infections after several hours, which should be a gut punch to those who fought so long against updating from XP.\n\n", "title": "2024\u5e74\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u592a\u967d\u5d50\u3092\u898b\u9003\u3057\u305f\uff1f6\u6708\u306b\u518d\u767b\u5834\u3078", "body": "2024\u5e74\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u592a\u967d\u5d50\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30ed\u30e9\u3092\u898b\u9003\u3057\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u304c\u30016\u6708\u306b\u518d\u3073\u73fe\u308c\u308b\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85\u3082\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u71b1\u4f1d\u5c0e\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u3001\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u653b\u6483\u306a\u3069\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u3082\u53d6\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["2024\u5e74\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u592a\u967d\u5d50\u3092\u898b\u9003\u3057\u305f\uff1f6\u6708\u306b\u518d\u767b\u5834\u3078", "Cooler Master\u306e\u65b0\u300cCryofuze 5\u300d\u71b1\u4f1d\u5c0e\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306eAI\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\uff1f", "\u4eba\u9593\u304c\u81ea\u5f8b\u578b\u8eca\u4e21\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\u5fc3\u6e29\u307e\u308b\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30c7\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u5909\u66f4\u3057\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u653b\u6483\u306f\u72af\u7f6a\uff1f", "Windows XP\u6a5f\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3069\u3046\u306a\u308b\u304b\uff1f"]}

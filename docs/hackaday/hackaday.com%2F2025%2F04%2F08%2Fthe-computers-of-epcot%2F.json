[ErnieTech] takes a glimpse at the UNIVAC computer that ran the operation in the 1980s. A lot of schools had UNIVAC 1100-series computers back in those days, so while you dont hear as much about them as, say, IBM 360s, there are hordes of people who have used the 1100s, even if they dont remember it.\nEPCOT opened in 1982, and it not only ran the attraction but was also visible as part of the exhibits ambiance. They even used the Peppers Ghost illusion to superimpose a little man on top of the equipment.\n\nSperry used the relationship with Disney for promotional purposes. Weve never found a good emulator for the 1100s. The UNIVAC had a 36-bit word and 6-bit characters. Wed love to see something like Hercules that could support Exec 8.\nThe UNIVAC originated with the Remington Rand company, which had bought Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. Remington Rand later merged with the Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. Eventually, the company reverted to the Sperry name before merging with Burroughs in 1986 to form UNISYS \u00a0 a company that still exists today.\n"}

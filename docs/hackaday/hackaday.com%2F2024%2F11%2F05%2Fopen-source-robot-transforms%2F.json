It led to a number of toys which can also change shapes from fighting robots into various ordinary objects as well. And, perhaps in a way of life imitating art, plenty of real-life robots have features one might think were inspired by this franchise like this transforming quadruped robot.\nCalled the CYOBot, the robot has four articulating arms with a wheel at the end of each. The arms can be placed in a wide array of positions for different operating characteristics, allowing the robot to move in an incredibly diverse way. Its based on a previous version called the CYOCrawler, using similar articulating arms but with no wheels. The build centers around an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, giving it plenty of compute power for things like machine learning, as well as wireless capabilities for control or access to more computing power.\nBoth robots are open source and modular as well, allowing a range of people to use and add on to the platform. Another perk here is that most parts are common or 3d printed, making it a fairly low barrier to entry for a platform with so many different configurations and options for expansion and development. If you prefer robots without wheels, though, wed always recommend looking at Strandbeests for inspiration.", "title": "- \u5909\u5f62\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\uff1aCYOBot\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305fCYOBot\u306f\u30014\u672c\u306e\u53ef\u52d5\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u52d5\u304d\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u62e1\u5f35\u6027\u3082\u9ad8\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5909\u5f62\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\uff1aCYOBot\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- ESP32-S3\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u958b\u767a", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bCYOBot\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aCYOCrawler\u304b\u3089CYOBot\u3078"]}

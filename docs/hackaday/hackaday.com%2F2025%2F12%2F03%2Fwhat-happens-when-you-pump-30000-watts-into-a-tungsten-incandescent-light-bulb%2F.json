And why on Earth would anybody do such a thing? Well [Drake] said it was because he wanted to outdo [Photonicinduction] who had already put 20,000 watts through a light bulb. Nothing like a little friendly competition to drive progress?\n\n[Drake] says he has purchased the most powerful incandescent light bulb ever made for commercial production. Rated for 24,000 watts (and operated at 30,000 watts) the enormous filament is made from tungsten. The starting current drawn by a light bulb is higher than the operating current, because the resistance of the filament increases with temperature, so its prudent to warm the device slowly. To this end [Drake] builds some custom wiring and dials to power the thing. Once thats done, its off to the forest to play!\nIf youre interested in over-the-top lighting shenanigans, you might enjoy reading about The World\u2019s Longest Range LED Flashlight.\n", "title": "- 30,000\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u96fb\u7403\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u5149\u3068\u71b1", "body": "YouTube\u306e[Drake]\u304c30,000\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u96fb\u7403\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u3001\u68ee\u3092\u7167\u3089\u3059\u660e\u308b\u3055\u3068\u71b1\u3055\u3092\u5b9f\u8a3c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 30,000\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u96fb\u7403\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u5149\u3068\u71b1", "- \u53cb\u597d\u7684\u306a\u7af6\u4e89\uff1a20,000\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u914d\u7dda\u3067\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u96fb\u7403\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u68ee\u3092\u7167\u3089\u3059\uff01\u8d85\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u96fb\u7403\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u767d\u71b1\u96fb\u7403\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6"]}

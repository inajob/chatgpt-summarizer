However, there has been a trend in the modern era to go for fancier animated turn signals using great numbers of LEDs. [ssh16] decided to whip up a set of their own to suit their late-model Mazda MX-5.\nFully lit, the replacement is brighter than the original bulb by some margin.\nWhile many builds go down the route of using addressable LEDs, [ssh16] instead went for garden variety OSRAM yellow LEDs in a 312 array, driven via a shift register. A small PIC microcontroller is then used to command the shift register to light the rows of LEDs in turn, generating the sequential lighting effect that sweeps from one side to the other. The LEDs are are installed on a 4 board designed to install in place of the Mazdas standard indicator bulb, with the animation spreading from the centerline of the vehicle out towards the direction of the turn.\nIts a fun build that modernizes the rear turn signals of the Mazda. Weve seen some other neat turn signal builds before, too; it almost seems to be a trend amongst Mazda enthusiasts. Meanwhile, if youve built your own automotive lighting mods, dont hesitate to send them in to the tipsline."}

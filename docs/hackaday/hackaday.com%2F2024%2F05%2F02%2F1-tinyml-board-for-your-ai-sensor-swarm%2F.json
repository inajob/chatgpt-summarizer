That might be true in many cases, but theres more to machine learning than you might think. For instance, what if you could shower anything with a network of cheap machine-learning-enabled sensors? The 1 dollar TinyML project by [Jon Nordby] allows you to do just that. These tiny boards host an STM32-like MCU, a BLE module, lithium ion power circuitry, and some nice sensor options  an accelerometer, a pair of microphones, and a light sensor.\nWhat could you do with these sensors? [Jon] has talked a bit about a few commercial and non-commercial applications hes worked on in his ML career, and tells us that the accelerometer alone lets you do human presence detection, sleep tracking, personal activity monitoring, or vibration pattern sensing, for a start. As for the sound input, theres tasks ranging from gunshot or clapping detection, to coffee roasting process tracking, voice and speech detection, and surely much more. Just a few years ago, weve seen machine learning used to comfort a barking dog while its owner is away.\nBottom line is, you ought to get a few of these in your hands and start playing with ML. You still might need a bit of beefier hardware to train your code, but it gets that much easier once you have a network of sensors waiting for your command. Plus, since its an open source project, youll have a much easier time adding on any additional capabilities your particular application might need.\nThese boards are pretty cost-optimized, which makes it possible for you to order a couple dozen without breaking the bank. The $1 target is BOM cost, especially if you opt to not include one of the pricier sensors. You can assemble these boards yourself, or get them assembled at a fab of your choice for barely a cost increase. As for software, they will work with the emlearn framework.\nEverything is on GitHub  from KiCad sources to Jupyter notebooks. As for Hackaday.io, there are five worklogs of impressive insight  the microphone worklog alone will teach you about microphone amplification in low-power conditions while keeping the cost low. Not as price-constrained and want to try on some image processing tasks? Heres a beautiful Pi Pico ArduCam board with a camera and a TFT screen."}

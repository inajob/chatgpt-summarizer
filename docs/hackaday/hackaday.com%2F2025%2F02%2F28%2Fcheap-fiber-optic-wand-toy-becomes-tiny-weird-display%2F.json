However, as [Ancient] shows us, you can turn them into a surprisingly nifty little display if youre so inclined.\nThe build starts by removing the fiber optic bundle from the wand. One end is left as a round bundle. At the other end, the strands are then fed into plastic frames to separate them out individually. After plenty of tedious sorting, the fibers are glued in place in a larger rectangular 3D-printed frame, which holds the fibers in place over a matrix of LEDs. The individual LEDs of the matrix light individual fibers, which carry the light to the round end of the bundle. The result is a tiny little round display driven by a much larger one at the other end.\n[Ancient] had hoped to use the set up for a volumetric display build, but found it too fragile to be fit for purpose. Still, its interesting to look at nonetheless, and a good demonstration of how fiber optics work in practice. As this display shows, you can have two glass fibers carrying completely different wavelengths of light right next to each other without issue.\nWeve featured some other great fiber optic hacks over the years, like this guide on making your own fiber couplings. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Zane and Darryl and Ash for the tip! This one was all over the tipsline!]"}

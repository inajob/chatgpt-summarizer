But what about having some fun? Thats the idea behind [Akaki Kuumeri]s accessibly-awesome Joy-Con controller, the Squid-Con, which provides access to every button with just one hand. It even has tripod and AMPS mounts.\nThe joysticks themselves are controlled with the thumb and pinky, although some of [Akaki]s beta testers changed it up a bit. Thats okay, because its designed to be comfortable in a variety of positions for either hand. As for the ABXY buttons, those are actuated using 3D-printed arms that connect to a central piece which [Akaki] calls the turbine.\nBut perhaps the coolest part of this project is the flexures that actuate the shoulder buttons (L, R, zL, and zR) on the controllers. Its a series of four arms that are actuated by bringing the fingers back toward the palm. If all of this sounds confusing, just check out the video after the break.\nWe love flexures around here, and weve seen them in everything from cat feeding calendars to 6-DOF positioners to completely new kinds of joysticks.\n\n"}

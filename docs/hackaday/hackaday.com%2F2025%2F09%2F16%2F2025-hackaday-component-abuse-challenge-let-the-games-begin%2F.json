In practice, everything has its limits, most components have non-ideal characteristics, and you can even turn most parts\u2019 functionality upside down.\nThe Component Abuse Challenge celebrates the use of LEDs as photosensors, capacitors as microphones, and resistors as heat sources. If you\u2019re using parts for purposes that simply aren\u2019t on the label, or getting away with pushing them to their absolute maximum ratings or beyond, this is the contest for you.\nIf you committed these sins against engineering out of need, DigiKey wants to help you out. They\u2019re probably got the right part, and they\u2019re providing us with three $150 gift certificates to give out to the top projects. (If you\u2019re hacking just for fun, well, you\u2019re still in the running.)\nThis is the contest where the number one rule is that you must break the rules, and the project has to work anyway. You\u2019ve got eight weeks, until Nov 11th. Open up a project over at Hackaday.io, pull down the menu to enter in the contest, and let the parts know no mercy!\nHonorable Mention Categories:\nWe\u2019ve come up with a few honorable mention categories to get your ideas flowing. You don\u2019t have to fit into one of these boxes to enter, but we\u2019ll be picking our favorites in these four categories for a shout-out when we reveal the winners.\n\nBizarro World: There is a duality in almost every component out there. Speakers are microphones, LEDs are light sensors, and peltier coolers generate electricity. Turn the parts upside down and show us what they can do.\nSide Effects: Most of the time, you\u2019re sad when a part\u2019s spec varies with temperature. Turn those lemons into lemonade, or better yet, thermometers.\nOut of Spec: How hard can you push that MOSFET before it lets go of the magic smoke? Show us your project dancing on the edge of the abyss and surviving.\nJunk Box Substitutions: What you really needed was an igniter coil. You used an eighth-watt resistor, and got it hot enough to catch the rocket motor on fire. Share your parts-swapping exploits with us.\n\nInspiration\nDiodes can do nearly anything.\u00a0 Their forward voltage varies with temperature, making them excellent thermometers. Even the humble LED can both glow and tell you how hot it is. And don\u2019t get us started on the photo-diode. They are not just photocells, but radiation detectors.\nHere\u2019s a trick to double the current that a 555 timer can sink. We\u2019d love to see other cases of 555 abuse, of course, but any other IC is fair game.\nResistors get hot. Thermochromic paint changes color with temperature. Every five years or so, we see an awesome new design. This ancient clock of [Sprite_tm]\u2019s lays the foundation, [Daniel Valuch] takes it into the matrix, and [anneosaur] uses the effect to brighten our days.\nOf course, thin traces can also be resistors, and resistors can get really hot. Check out [Carl Bujega]\u2019s self-soldering four-layer PCB. And while magnetism is nearly magic, a broken inductor can still be put to good use as a bike chain sensor.\nOr maybe you have a new twist on the absolutely classic LEDs-as-light-sensors? Just because its been done since the early says of [Forrest Mims] doesnt mean we dont want to see your take.\nGet out there and show us how you can do it wrong too.\n \n\n\n"}

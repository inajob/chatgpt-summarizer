It was a beautiful unit, but confusing, as this keyboard comes with an 8-pin DIN connector. A 5-pin DIN plug or 6-pin Mini-DIN would be easy to work with, but what was this odd connection? Turns out the Fujitsu N860-2500-T111 came with an Olympus CV-100 Video Processor, which was designed for medical imaging, potentially among other uses. And as often happened with old specialized hardware, the keyboard used a proprietary protocol for sending keystrokes.\n[Clint] put out a call for anyone that could help him build an adapter, and [Andy] from Element14 answered the call. But this problem requires more than an adapter, mainly because the Fujitsu doesnt have key rollover. Its one key at a time, and that just doesnt work for the sort of things [Clint] shows off on LGR. So, the electronic guts of the keyboard were removed, to be replaced with a Raspberry Pi Pico, wired directly to the keyboard matrix.\n\nTheres a great tip in there, that you can use the non-stick backing from a printed label to get a really clean flattened hot glue coating. With some wiring and gluing, the Pico fits cleanly into the keyboard case with no external modifications. A simple pigtail adapter is used to physically interface with a PS/2 port. The source is available if you need to pull off a similar hack.\n", "title": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u85e4\u672c\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "LGR\u306e[Clint]\u304c\u53e4\u3044Fujitsu\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u5947\u5999\u3067\u30018\u30d4\u30f3DIN\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5c02\u7528\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002[Andy]\u304cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002PS/2\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d4\u30ae\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u85e4\u672c\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u85e4\u672c\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d4\u30ae\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u85e4\u672c\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u975e\u7c98\u7740\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7dba\u9e97\u306a\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u985e\u4f3c\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u884c\u3046\u5834\u5408\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b"]}

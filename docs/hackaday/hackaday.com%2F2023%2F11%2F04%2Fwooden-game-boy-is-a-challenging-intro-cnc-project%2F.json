And spoiler alert: he nailed it.\nOf course, he did have a few things going for him. At least from a straight woodworking perspective, its hard to go wrong by choosing walnut as your material. Then again, it can be unforgiving at times, and picky about tooling, which is probably why [Sebastian] used nine different tools to get the job done. But where he upped the difficulty level was in reproducing so many of the details of the original injection-molded plastic case. There are top and bottom shells, each of which has to be milled from both sides. This makes registration tricky when the parts are flipped. Specific indexing holes were used for that, along with the old blue tape and CA glue fixturing trick, which seemed to work quite well. For our money, though, the best bit is the lettering on the front face, which was milled out with an engraving bit and then filled with a spritz of white spray paint. A surfacing bit then came along to knock the overspray down, leaving labels that contrast beautifully with the dark wood. Gorgeous!\nIt wasnt all easy sailing, though. There are just some things plastic can do that wood cant, like holding screw threads in small studs without splitting. So, the case had to be glued shut once the mix of salvaged and new components went in. Still, it looks fabulous, and [Sebastian] says what we see in the video below is the one and only piece. Pretty sweet for the first try. Surprisingly, it doesnt seem as if weve seen a wooden Game Boy before  a wooden NES, sure, but not a Game Boy.\n\n", "title": "CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u9762\u5012\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3082\u3001\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u306f\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u6210\u529f\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6587\u5b57\u306f\u30a8\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u5207\u308a\u629c\u304b\u308c\u3001\u767d\u3044\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3067\u5857\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u63a5\u7740\u5264\u3067\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9\u306b\u5f6b\u523b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6728\u88fd\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u6728\u5de5\u6280\u8853\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "\u6728\u88fd\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3068\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5b8c\u6210"]}

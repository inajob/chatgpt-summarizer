To the disappointment of some, it doesnt actually work\u2014you cant really write a letter with it. [Koenkun Bricks] decided to rectify this with their own functional design.\nRight away, well state that this is not a traditional typewriter. There are no off-the-shelf Lego components with embossed letters on them, so it wasnt possible to make Lego type bars that could leave an impression on paper with the use of an inked ribbon. Instead, [Koenkun Bricks] decided to build a design that was Lego all the way down, right to the letters themselves. The complicated keyboard-actuated mechanism picks out flat letter tiles and punches them on to a flat Lego plate, creating a plastic document instead of a paper one.\nIts not perfect in operation. It has some issues unique to its mode of operation. Namely, the round letter tiles sometimes rotate the wrong way as theyre feeding through the typewriters mechanisms, so you get sideways letters on your finished document. It looks kind of cool, though. Outside of that, sometimes the letter pusher doesnt quite seat the letter tiles fully on the document plate.\nOverall, though, its a highly functional and impressive build. Weve seen some other great DIY typewriters before, too, like this 3D printed build. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to hn3000] for the tip!]"}

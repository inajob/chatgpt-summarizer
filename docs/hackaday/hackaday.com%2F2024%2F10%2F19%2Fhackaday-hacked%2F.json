Last week, we wrote a newsletter post about the state of Hackaday\u2019s comments. We get good ones and bad ones, and almost all the time, we leave you all up to your own devices. But every once in a while, it\u2019s good to remind people to be nice to our fellow hackers who get featured here, because after all they are the people doing the work that gives us something to read and write about. The whole point of the comment section is for you all to help them, or other Hackaday readers who want to follow in their footsteps.\nSomeone decided to let loose a comment-reporting attack. It works like this: you hit the \u201creport comment\u201d button on a given comment multiple times from multiple different IP addresses, and our system sends the comments back to moderation until a human editor can re-approve them. Given the context of an article about moderation, most everyone whose comment disappeared thought that we were behind it. When more than 300 comments were suddenly sitting in the moderation queue, our weekend editors figured something was up and started un-flagging comments as fast as they could. Order was eventually restored, but it was ugly for a while.\nWe\u2019ve had these attacks before, but probably only a handful of times over the last ten years, and there\u2019s basically nothing we can do to prevent them that won\u2019t also prevent you all from flagging honestly abusive or spammy comments. (For which, thanks! It helps keep Hackaday\u2019s comments clean.) Why doesn\u2019t it happen all the time? Most of you all are just good people. Thanks for that, too!\nBut despite the interruption, we got a good discussion started about how to make a comment section thrive. A valid critique of our current system that was particularly evident during the hack is that the reported comment mechanism is entirely opaque. A \u201cyour comment is being moderated\u201d placeholder would be a lot nicer than simply having the comment disappear. We\u2019ll have to look into that.\nYou were basically divided down the middle about whether an upvote/downvote system like on Reddit or Slashdot would serve us well. Those tend to push more constructive comments up to the top, but they also create a popularity contest that can become its own mini-game, and that\u2019s not necessarily always a good thing. Everyone seemed pretty convinced that our continuing to allow anonymous comments is the right choice, and we think it is simply because it removes a registration burden when someone new wants to write something insightful.\nWhat else? If you could re-design the Hackaday comment section from scratch, what would you do? Or better yet, do you have any examples of similar (tech) communities that are particularly well run? How do they do it?\nWe spend our time either writing and searching for cool hacks, or moderating, and you can guess which we\u2019d rather. At the end of the day, our comments are made up of Hackaday readers. So thanks to all of you who have, over the last week, thought twice and kept it nice.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks. It also includes our favorite articles from the last seven days that you can see on the web version of the newsletter.\n\nWant this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning?

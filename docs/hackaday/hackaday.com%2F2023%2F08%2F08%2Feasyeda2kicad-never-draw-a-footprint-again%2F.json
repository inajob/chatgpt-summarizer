Such is my friends impression of the tool that shes shown me and Im about to show you in turn, having used this tool for a few projects, I cant really disagree!\nWe all know of the JLCPCB/LCSC/EasyEDA trio, and their integration makes a lot of sense. Youre expected to design your boards in EasyEDA, order the components on LCSC, and get the boards made by JLCPCB. Its meant to be a one-stop shop, and as you might expect, theres tight integration between all three. If there wasnt, youd be tempted to step outside of the ecosystem, after all.\nBut like many in this community, I use KiCad, and I dont expect to move to a different PCB design suite  especially not a cloud one. Still, I enjoy using the JLCPCB and LCSC combination in the hobby PCB market as it stands now, and despite my KiCad affinity, it appears that EasyEDA can help me after all!\n\nAll Data, No Hassle\nOne of the hard-to-beat EasyEDA-LCSC integration aspects is that you can easily add LCSC parts to your boards. Theres no need to hunt for footprints and symbols, theyre all ready to go. You simply get the LCSC inventory at your fingertips, or at least the part of it thats been documented by EasyEDA engineers. Indeed, this information isnt just EasyEDA-specific, you can access it externally, and theres a tool called easyeda2kicad that lets you download all the part files in KiCad format!\nIn the end, it fit with space to spare!\nFor instance, I was recently looking for microSD sockets  something that I have a tried and true part for. Theres a few hundred pieces in a bag next to my desk, even. Todays constraint? It has to be less wide than the card itself, since I have to fit it into a narrow spot. Mouser didnt have any good parts for me, but LCSC did. The sockets I found were also way cheaper, even including shipping and VAT. So, Ive found a good part, but oh no, the footprint has ten pads and the mechanical dimensions are only half-intelligible, and I just want to get to drawing the long overdue board already!\nAll you need from here is the easyeda2kicad script installed  it takes the LCSC part number and creates the symbol, footprint and 3D model files for you automatically. To be clear, not all LCSC parts have been digitized. But that said, for one project of hers, my friend could successfully download a whole MXM slot, DisplayPort, miniDisplayPort and VGA connectors, and a few inductors with non-standard footprints; a combination that would typically need you to sit down in front of a PCB editor for a few hours, and thats certainly not including the 3D models.\nLimited, But Great Nevertheless\nChoice in EDA software is something way less malleable than component and PCB service choice, and it rocks that this software now gives us an extra option. Ive gone through a few projects by now with this script at the ready, the footprints and symbols have all worked as advertised, and while I still need to design footprints every now and then, theyre usually something exotic.\nYou could draw this from scratch, or you could run a script  the choice is yours\neasyeda2kicad will absolutely help if, like me, you have a foot strongly in the JLCPCB+LCSC field. Or the Eastern parts field at all. Ive given a good few thousand dollars to these two companies, for personal and business purposes alike, and I dont see a reason Id stop just yet. Im not here to promote any specific company, of course, and youll guess correctly that Ive had these footprints and symbols work for Aliexpress parts, too, as long as you find which LCSC part they correspond to.\nThere are, of course, a few problems. The footprints have dubious legal status  any license granted likely doesnt include such external use, and while we wouldnt foresee problems adding such parts to open-source projects, its a technicality to keep in mind. These symbols and footprints are untested unless we know otherwise, unlike parts in the KiCad library, and as usual, they might deviate from datasheet in important ways.\nYoure also at the mercy of the EasyEDA API, which you might remember [Jan Mrazek]s irreplaceable LCSC search tool had problems with in the past. The problems have since been resolved, but the situation has left a bad aftertaste.\nYou might think that this is free symbol and footprint galore, and in a way, it is! Of course, the LCSC-JLCPCB-EasyEDA trio still wins  youre more likely to use their services if you use this tool. Theres a reason why Western manufacturers often provide the same services, giving you footprints, symbols and 3D models so that you have it easier starting a new design within their ecosystem. SnapEDA, a similar service for Western parts, has been a mainstay in the electronics world, and to think of it, its long overdue to have such an option for Eastern parts!"}

In this case, hes visiting the Bathysphere, a project created by a couple of passionate hobbyists in Italy. The project is housed at Explorandia, which based on google translate, sounds like a pretty epic hackerspace.\nThe Bathysphere project itself is a simulation of a submarine. Sounds simple, but this project is anything but.\u00a0 There are no VR goggles involved.\u00a0 Budding captains who are up for the challenge find themselves inside the cockpit of a mini-submarine. The sub itself is on a DIY motion platform. Strong electric motors move the system causing riders to feel like they are truly underwater. Inside the cockpit, the detail is amazing. All sorts of switches, lights, and greebles make for a realistic experience.\u00a0 An electronic voice provides the ship status, and lets the crew know of any emergencies. (Spoiler alert  there will be emergencies!)\nThe real gem is how this simulation operates. A Logitec webcam is mounted on an XY gantry. This camera then is dipped underwater in a small pond. Video from the camera is sent to a large monitor which serves as the subs window. Its all very 1960s simulator tech, but the effect works. The subtle movements of the simulator platform really make the users feel like they are 20,000 leagues under the sea.\nCheck out the video after the break for more info!\n\n"}

You can see a demo of the system in the video below. You might wonder why youd want to study a three-decade-old program written for a CPU by a nine-year-old almost five decades ago. Well, honestly, we arent sure either. But it did get us thinking.\nKids today are computer savvy and have hardware that would seem to be alien tech in 1988. How many of them could duplicate this feat? Now, how many could do it in assembly language?\nLOCS had a few simple commands and was sort of a stripped-down scripting language. The BORRA command clears the screen. TORTUGA centers the turtle. PT (pone tortuga) moves the turtle to any spot on the screen. Then SM, AM, DM, and IM move the turtle up, down, right, and left. Probably helps if you speak a little Spanish.\nThe program fits on three pages of handwritten code. When was the last time you wrote code on paper? [\u00d3scar] revisits the program to run it on an MSX. The original program was under 500 bytes but adding the code for MSX balloons it to 589 bytes. Gotta love assembly language.\nYou could argue that LOCS isnt a language because it doesnt have variables, expressions, or looping. [\u00d3scar] retorts that HTML doesnt have those things either, and yet some call it a language. Honestly, if a 9-year-old can create this, we think they can call it anything they want to!\nBy 1990, hed graduated to full-blown games. If turtle graphics are too abstract for you, try a Big Trak.\n\n"}

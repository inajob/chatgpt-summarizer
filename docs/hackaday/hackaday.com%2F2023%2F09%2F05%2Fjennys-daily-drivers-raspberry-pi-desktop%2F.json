In those far-off days, the Debian OS distro for the board wasnt even yet called Raspbian, but it would run a full-on desktop on your TV and you could use it after a fashion to browse the web or do wordprocessing. It wasnt in any way fast, but it was usable enough to be more than a novelty. Ive said before on these pages that the Raspberry Pi folks key product is their OS rather than their computers. While they rarely have the fastest or highest spec hardware, you can depend on Raspberry Pi OS being updated and supported through the life of the board unlike many of their competitors. I can download their latest OS image and still run it on that 2012 board, which to me ranks as a very laudable achievement.\nThe OS They Dont Really Tell You About\nThe background image may have changed since the first release back in 2016, but the UI hasnt.\nRaspberry Pi OS doesnt run on any other ARM single board computers but their own, but its not quite accurate to say that it only runs on Raspberry Pi hardware. Since 2016 when it was launched as PIXEL, the folks in Cambridge have also maintained a PC version for 32-bit i386 computers, now called Raspberry Pi Desktop. It may be the Pi product they dont talk about much, but\u00a0 you can still find it on their downloads page.\nLike the ARM version, its based on Debian and presents as close as possible to the environment youd find on your Pi. Im interested to see whether it still lives up to the claim of being usable on older hardware, so Ive downloaded a copy and installed it on my trusty 2007 Dell Inspiron 640. It rocks a 1.6 GHz Core Duo with 4 GB of memory and a SATA SSD so its not the lowest spec hardware on the block, but by 2023s standard it represents a giveaway-spec old laptop. Can I use it as a daily driver? Lets find out!\nThe first thing I noticed on downloading the ISO was that its dated July 2022 and is based upon Debian 11, Bullseye. This is the same Debian version as the current ARM distro for the Pi, but a year-old ISO leaves me with mild abandonware concerns. I made a note to be especially careful to run an apt upgrade on first boot.\nPolished At First Sight, But A\u00a0 Little Unfinished At The Edges\nAs shipped, it doesnt bind the Print Screen key. Spectrum image: Bill Bertram, CC BY-SA 2.5.\nThe installation is extremely straightforward and very Debian in nature. You have all the choices and you can go off-piste should you wish, but the default options are pre-selected and thus its almost as simple as hitting return at every option. The first boot is familiar to seasoned Pi users, as youre taken into locale and user creation screens but without the Pi configuration youd find on the single board computers. Then its time to reboot, and after a not-too-long startup, youre into the familiar Raspberry Pi desktop.\nIts LXDE-based so its a smooth experience on the Dell.\u00a0 Opening up the menu, we find the full Raspberry Pi suite of educational software, plus Chromium, and the LibreOffice productivity suite. Theres a graphical software package installer but its limited to a meagre selection of Pi-approved packages, so its off to apt should you wish for more. I did exactly that after upgrading my packages, choosing to download the GIMP graphics package. So Ive installed the Raspberry Pi Desktop, and Ive got a Debian system with LXDE and a few Pi extras. I can see its great for anyone using a Pi on a regular basis, and although the Dell is slow by 2023 standards its quick enough to be perfectly usable. Its a conventional Linux desktop, however there are a few unexpected quirks even so. Out of the box theres no binding from the Print Screen key to scrot, meaning I had a minor task chasing up how to do that.\nSo Raspberry Pi Desktop is a conventional Linux desktop for 32-bit Intel platforms, with a comfortingly familiar back-end, a very Pi-like interface, and none of the treacle slowness of an Ubuntu variant. You can use it as a daily driver, I did so, and youll find it an extremely basic but perfectly acceptable experience. I think Ill leave it on the Dell, unlike the Lubuntu that was on the machine before it restores a bit of zip to the experience of a 14-year-old machine.\nEndnote: The Daily Driver That Wasnt\nAs a final note, this months Daily Drivers wasnt supposed to feature this OS at all. Instead I was going to feature the open-source BeOS continuation, Haiku. I havent done that though, because despite a lot of work throughout the last month, enlisting the help of multiple hackerspace friends, and even asking for help online, I simply couldnt get Haiku to reliably boot on any machine I tried. Between us we have the experience to get almost anything running, but this one defeated us. I am not however here to deliver a roasting to the OS for not working when I tried it, because this series is about using it as a day-to-day OS on real hardware, and I feel that Haiku or any other OS still deserves the chance to deliver that. Thus Ill leave Haiku on the shelf for now, and come back to it again in the future when perhaps it will have a version which I can work with.", "title": "Raspberry Pi OS: A Fully-Functional Desktop Computer in Your Hand", "body": "2012\u5e74\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u3082\u6700\u65b0\u306eOS\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u7af6\u5408\u88fd\u54c1\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308a\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u7d9a\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001Raspberry Pi OS\u306fRaspberry Pi\u4ee5\u5916\u306eARM\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u306f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u300132\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8i386\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5411\u3051\u306b\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306ePC\u7248\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Raspberry Pi\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084Chromium\u3001LibreOffice\u306a\u3069\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi OS: A Fully-Functional Desktop Computer in Your Hand", "Raspberry Pi Desktop: Use Your Pi OS on an Intel Platform", "Raspberry Pi OS: Usable on Older Hardware - A Test on a 2007 Dell Inspiron", "Raspberry Pi Desktop: A Conventional Linux Desktop for Intel Platforms", "Exploring Raspberry Pi OS: A Basic but Acceptable Daily Driver Experience"]}

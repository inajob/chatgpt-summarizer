What do you do? There are a few possible answers, but [Mr SolderFix] likes to pull a strand from a large wire, file the point down, and coil it around the soldering iron. This gives you a very tiny hot tip. Sure, the wire wont last forever, but who cares? When it gives up, you can simply make another one.\nMany people have done things like this before  we are guilty  but we really liked [Mr Solder Fixs] presentation over two videos that you can see below. He coils his wire over a form. In his case, hes using a screwdriver handle and some tape to get to the right size. Weve been known to use the shanks of drill bits for that purpose, since it is easy to get different sizes.\n\nTruthfully, while sometimes you do really need a tiny tip, we prefer having a tip with some thermal mass. If you use something shaped like a slotted screwdriver blade, you can get contact area when you need it, or rotate the iron 90 degrees and get a very narrow profile.\nBut the copper coil method does work well, as you can see. This will work with nearly any iron. The first examples with fairly large resistors work predictably well. But we were really impressed with some of the very fine pitch connectors in part 2.\nOf course, a fine tip is only part of the equation. It doesnt hurt that he has a microscope and thin solder. If you want to up your SMD game, Oregon State University can help. We find it amusing that many products today are smaller than the components we used to use.\n\n"}

But if youve got a well stocked parts bin, theres a good chance youve already got most of what you need to build your own Crunch-E.\nA Crunch-E built from stacked modules\nDescribed by creator [Roman Revzin] as a keychain form factor music-making platform, the Crunch-E combines an ESP32, an MAX98357 I2S audio amplifier, an array of tactile buttons, and a sprinkling of LEDs and passives. It can be built on a perfboard using off-the-shelf modules, or you can spin up a PCB if you want something a bit more professional. It sounds like theres eventually going to be an option to purchase a pre-built Crunch-E at some point as well.\nBut ultimately, the hardware seems to be somewhat freeform  the implementation isnt so important as long as youve got the major components and can get the provided software running on it.\nThe software, which [Roman] is calling CrunchOS, currently provides four tracks, ten synth instruments, and two drum machine banks. Everything can be accessed from a 4 x 4 button array, and theres a cheat sheet in the documentation that shows what each key does in the default configuration. Judging by the demo video below, its already an impressively capable platform. But this is just the beginning. If everything goes according to plan and more folks start jamming on their own Crunch-E hardware, its not hard to imagine how the software side can be expanded and adapted over time.\nOver the years weve seen plenty of homebrew projects for producing electronic music, but the low-cost, simple construction, and instant gratification nature of the Crunch-E strikes us as a particularly compelling combination. Were eager to see where things develop from here.\n\n"}

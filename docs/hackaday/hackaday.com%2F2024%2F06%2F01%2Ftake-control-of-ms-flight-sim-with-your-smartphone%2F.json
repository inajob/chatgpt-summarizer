But a traditional HOTAS system can be a bit of an investment, so you might want to thank [Vaibhav Sharma] for the virtualHOTAS project that brings a configurable HOTAS interface to your phone  just in time to try out that Dune expansion for MSFS.\nThe phones orientation sensors are used as a joystick, and on the screen, theres both sliders and buttons you can use as in-game controls. On the back-end theres a Python program on the computer which exposes a webserver that the phone connects to, translating sensor and press data without the need for an app. This works wonderfully in MSFS, as [Vaibhav] shows us in the video below. Whats more, if you get tired of the touchscreen-and-accelerometer controls, you can even connect a generic smartphone-designed game controller platform, to have its commands and movements be translated to your PC too!\nAll the code is open source, and with the way this project operates, it will likely work as a general-purpose interface for other projects of yours. Whether you might want to build an accessibility controller from its codebase, use it for your robot platform, maybe simply repurpose this project for any other game, [Vaibhav]s creation is yet another reminder that were carrying a sensor-packed platform, and it might just help you build a peripheral you didnt know you needed.\nDont have a phone handy? Perhaps an Xbox controller could work with just a few 3D printed upgrades, or you could stock up on buttons and build your own joystick from scratch. Oh, and keeping HOTAS principles in mind can be pretty helpful  you might get to redesign the venerable computer mouse, for instance!\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4eee\u60f3HOTAS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u98db\u884c\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306f\u3001\u4eee\u60f3\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3084\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fHOTAS\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002Vaibhav Sharma\u6c0f\u306b\u3088\u308bvirtualHOTAS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u306aHOTAS\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002MSFS\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4eee\u60f3HOTAS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "Python\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4eee\u60f3HOTAS\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "MSFS\u5411\u3051\u306b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3HOTAS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

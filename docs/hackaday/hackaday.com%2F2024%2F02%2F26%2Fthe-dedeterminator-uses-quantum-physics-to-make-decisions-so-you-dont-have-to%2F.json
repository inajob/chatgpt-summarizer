Why go through the agony, when you could hand over the railway switch of determinism to a machine that can decide things for you! Enter the DeDeterminator, a decision machine from [Oliver Child].\nThe construction is simple enough, being built inside a small tin. One kind of wishes it had a secret third PERHAPS bulb that illuminates only when the universes continued existence has been called into question.\nThe idea is simple. At the press of a button, the DeDeterminator illuminates a bulb\u2014indicating either yes or no. The decision for which bulb to illuminate is truly random, as its determined by the radioactive decay of a Americium-241 alpha particle source. A Geiger-Muller tube is used to detect alpha particles, with the timing between detections used to determine the yes-or-no output of the device.\nIts a neat concept, and its kind of fun knowing that your decision is both out of your hands and as random as it could possibly be. Would the universe guide you wrong? Who could possibly question the reasoning of the particles? The only rational move could be to comply with whatever directive the box hath given. Just dont ask it to make any decisions with dangerous outcomes.\nWeve featured other projects using radioactive decay for random number generation before, though they werent quite as philosophically intriguing as the DeDeterminator. Mostly theyre just about cryptographic security and such, but some do deal with causality in imaginary spaces, which has its own magic about it.\nMeanwhile, if youve untangled the quantum chains of cause and effect, or youve just found a way to break RSA encryption using a Pi Pico, do drop us a line, wont you?", "title": "\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3092\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306b\u884c\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e", "body": "\u610f\u601d\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3092\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u4efb\u305b\u305f\u3044\uff1fDeDeterminator\u306f\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u80fd\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306a\u6c7a\u5b9a\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3002\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30b7\u30a6\u30e0-241\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u7c92\u5b50\u3067\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306a\u5149\u3092\u767a\u3057\u3001\u30b8\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\uff1d\u30df\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u7ba1\u3067\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u3002\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u306b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u304f\u3001\u6697\u53f7\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3084\u56e0\u679c\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u6271\u3046\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3092\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306b\u884c\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u30aa\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u5275\u9020\u3057\u305f\u300c\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u6c7a\u5b9a\u88c5\u7f6e\uff1a\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30b7\u30a6\u30e0-241\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306a\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30c7\u30c7\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u95a2\u4fc2\u306e\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u8003\u5bdf"]}

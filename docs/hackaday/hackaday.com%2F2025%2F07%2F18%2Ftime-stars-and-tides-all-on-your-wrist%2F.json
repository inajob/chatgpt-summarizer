Less than a year after last year\u2019s horological kettlebell, the 960g Berkley Grand Complication, a new invention had to be worked out. And so, they delivered. Vacheron Constantin\u2019s Solaria Ultra Grand Complication is more than just the world\u2019s most complicated wristwatch. It\u2019s a fine bit of precision engineering, packed with 41 complications, 13 pending patents, and a real-time star tracker the size of a 2-Euro coin.\nYes, there\u2019s a Westminster chime and a tourbillon, but the real novelty is a dual-sapphire sky chart that lets you track constellations using a split-second chronograph. Start the chrono at dusk, aim your arrow at the stars, and it\u2019ll tell you when a chosen star will appear overhead that night.\nBuilt by a single watchmaker over eight years, the 36mm-wide movement houses 1,521 parts and 204 jewels. Despite the mad complexity, the watch stays wearable at just 45mm wide and 15mm thick, smaller than your average Seamaster. This is a wonder of analog computational mechanics. Just before you think of getting it gifted for Christmas, think twice  rumors are itll be quite pricey.", "title": "- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u8155\u6642\u8a08\u300c\u30bd\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30e5\u30ed\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6642\u8a08\u306f\u300141\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u661f\u5ea7\u8ffd\u8de1\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u8907\u96d1\u6642\u8a08\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u8155\u6642\u8a08\u300c\u30bd\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 41\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u661f\u5ea7\u8ffd\u8de1\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08", "- \u4e00\u4eba\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u8077\u4eba\u304c8\u5e74\u304b\u3051\u3066\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1", "- \u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\uff1a\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b5\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u661f\u7a7a\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u9ad8\u984d\u3067\u3082\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u305f\u3044\uff01\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d50\u6676\u300c\u30bd\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u300d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c"]}

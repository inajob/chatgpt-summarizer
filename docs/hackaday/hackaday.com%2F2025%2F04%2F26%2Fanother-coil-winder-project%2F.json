If you spend any time winding one, you are almost guaranteed to think about building a coil winder. Maybe thats why so many people do. [Jtacha] did a take on the project, and we were impressed  it looks great.\nThe device has a keypad and an LCD. You can enter a number of turns or the desired inductance. It also lets you wind at an angle. So it is suitable for RF coils, Tesla coils, or any other reason you need a coil.\n\nThere are a number of 3D printed parts, so this doesnt look like an hour project. Luckily, none of the parts are too large. The main part is 2020 extrusion, and you will need to tap the ends of some of the pieces.\nThere is a brief and strangely dark video in the post if you want to see the machine in operation. The resulting coil looked good, especially if you compare it to how our hand-wound ones usually look.\nWhile most of the coil winders we see have some type of motor, thats not a necessity."}

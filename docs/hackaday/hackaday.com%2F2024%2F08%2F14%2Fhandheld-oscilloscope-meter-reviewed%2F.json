As [IMSAI Guy] shows in a recent video, for what you might expect to pay for a decent meter, you can now get one that includes a scope. There are several options out there but it is hard to know how much to spend to get the best possible product. The Zoyi ZT-702S that he looks at costs under $80. But is it worth it?\nScopes that connect to your PC are often very inexpensive. You can also find little toy scopes that use a microcontroller and a little LCD screen. Even though the specs on these are usually appalling, they will still let you visualize whats happening in a circuit. Sure, you want an expensive bench scope with lots of channels sometimes, but often, you just need to see a signal in broad strokes. Having a scope and a meter together is very handy.\n\nThe little meter claims 10 MHz bandwidth and 48 megasamples per second in scope mode. The meter claims true RMS and 9999 counts. The internal battery charges from USB-C. As you might expect, the meter portion works well enough for a basic meter. The scope reacts well up to 5 MHz. It isnt necessarily the best scope in the world, but for $80 it seemed quite adequate. The probe compensation wasnt able to quite make a square wave square, but you still got the idea.\nAs commenters on the video pointed out, there is a newer model that has two channels (at a slightly higher price tag). They also point out that there are dozens of similar devices at different price points, and everyone has their favorite.\nIf you have hobby-level cash, wed suggest a higher-end scope meter like an OWON or Hantek since the professional brands are still very expensive. We wonder what the designer of 1983s Pocket-O-Scope would think of these modern devices.\n", "title": "80\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u5165\u9580\u5411\u3051\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "body": "80\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u306eZoyi ZT-702S\u306a\u3069\u3092\u542b\u3080\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5165\u624b\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u3002PC\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3082\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u306eJoulescope\u306a\u3069\u3068\u3064\u306a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304c\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u3067\u3082\u5341\u5206\u3002", "titles": ["80\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u5165\u9580\u5411\u3051\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "PC\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7: 1983\u5e74\u7248\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3068\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\uff1a\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

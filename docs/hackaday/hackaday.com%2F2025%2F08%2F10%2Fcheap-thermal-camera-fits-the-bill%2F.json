The cost is well under $100. You can watch it do its thing in the video below.\nTheres a PCB layout, a 3D-printed case, and  of course  all the firmware files.\u00a0 The code uses the Arduino IDE and libraries. It leverages off-the-shelf libraries for the display and the image sensor.\n\nThe image sensor isnt going to wow you. It has a resolution of 24 x 32, although thats better than some cheap cameras, and it can still honestly be good for what part is heating up explorations. There is probably room for some clever smoothing in software as well. For only three or four times the price, you can find cameras with resolutions around 256\u00d7192, which is good for a thermal camera, even though it isnt the megapixels we expect from our optical cameras or our phones.\nThe bill of materials is relatively short. The bulk of the circuit and effort is in the circuit to charge the battery, regulate it, and protect it against bad behavior.\nCant decide if you need a camera at all? You arent alone. Or you can cheap out, but you might get what you pay for.\n"}

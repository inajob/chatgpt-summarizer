Metal casting in the kitchen is possible, as demonstrated by this over-the-top bathroom hook repair using a microwave forge.\nNow, just because its possible doesnt mean its advisable. There are a lot better ways to fix something as mundane as a broken bathroom hook, as [Denny] readily admits in the video below. But hes been at the whole kitchen forging thing since building his microwave oven forge, which uses a special but easily constructed ceramic heat chamber to hold a silicon carbide crucible. So casting a replacement hook from brass seemed like a nice exercise.\nThe casting process starts with a 3D-printed model of the missing peg, which gets accessories such as a pouring sprue and a thread-forming screw attached to it with cheese wax. This goes into a 3D-printed mold which is filled with a refractory investment mix of plaster and sand. The green mold is put in an air fryer to dry, then wrapped in aluminum foil to protect it while the PLA is baked out in the microwave. Scrap brass gets its turn in the microwave before being poured into the mold, which is sitting in [Denny]s vacuum casting rig.\nThe whole thing is over in seconds, and the results are pretty impressive. The vacuum rig ensures metal fills the mold evenly without voids or gaps. The brass even fills in around the screw, leaving a perfect internal thread. A little polishing and the peg is ready for bathroom duty. Overly complicated? Perhaps, but [Denny] clearly benefits from the practice jobs like this offer, and the look is pretty cool too. Still, wed probably want to do this in the garage rather than the kitchen.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u7089\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u92f3\u9020: \u30d0\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "body": "\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u94f8\u9020\u306f\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bb6\u304c\u96fb\u5b50\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u30d5\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4f46\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3067\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u5225\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3002-", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u7089\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u92f3\u9020: \u30d0\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u7089\u3067\u92f3\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "DIY: \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u7089\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3067\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u88fd\u30d0\u30b9\u30d5\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u92f3\u9020", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0: \u5bb6\u5ead\u3067\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5"]}

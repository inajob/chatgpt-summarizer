Yet as much as [Calvin Wankhede] loves home automation, hed very much like for it to not stop working the moment his internet connection goes down, or the company running the service goes bankrupt. This is where his journey to create an off-line alternative smart home based around Home Assistant and other (open) software began.\nAlthough Home Assistant (HA) itself has become significantly easier to use, what becomes readily apparent from [Calvin]s journey is that setting up and managing your own smart home infrastructure is a never-ending project. A project that involves finding compatible hardware that can tie into HA, whether or not without reflashing the firmware, resolving configuration issues and other assorted fun. If you are into this kind of thing, it is of course a blast, and its a good feeling when it finally all works.\nUnfortunately, interoperability across smart home and similar IoT devices is still a far-off dream, even with the introduction of Thread and Matter (which incidentally are among the worst product names to search for, period), as Matters uptake is pretty abysmal. This thus leaves off-line smart homes mostly as the domain of the tech-inclined in search of a hobby.", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u6700\u8fd1\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5bb6\u96fb\u3084\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3084\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3084\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u5012\u7523\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[Calvin]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u3001Home Assistant\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u69cb\u7bc9\u3084\u7ba1\u7406\u306f\u4e00\u751f\u7d9a\u304f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u3067\u3082\u76f8\u4e92\u904b\u7528\u6027\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u72b6\u6cc1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "Home Assistant\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u69cb\u7bc9\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

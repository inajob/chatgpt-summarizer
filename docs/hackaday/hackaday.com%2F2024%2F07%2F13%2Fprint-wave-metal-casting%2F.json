[Denny] from Shake the Future shows us how to simplify the process with print wave metal casting.\nThe first step of printing a PLA object will seem familiar to any 3D print to metal process, but the main differentiator here is pouring the investment casting on the printer build plate itself. We like how he used some G-code to shake the build plate to help remove bubbles. Once the plaster solidifies, the plastic and mold are placed in the microwave to soften the plastic for removal.\nThe plaster is dried in an oven (or air fryer) and then [Denny] bolts the mold together for the casting process. Adding a vacuum helps with the surface finish, but you can always polish the metal with a generous helping of elbow grease.\nIf [Denny] seems familiar, you might remember his very detailed breakdown of microwave casting. Weve seen plenty of different approaches to metal casting over the years here. Need a part in another material? How about casting concrete or resin?\nThanks to [marble] on the Hackaday Discord for the tip!\n\n"}

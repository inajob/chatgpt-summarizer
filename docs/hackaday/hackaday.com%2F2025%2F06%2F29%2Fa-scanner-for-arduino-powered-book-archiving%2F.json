[Brad Mattson] had some books to scan, but couldn\u2019t find an affordable scanner that met his needs, so he took the obvious hacker solution and built his own.\nThe scanning process starts when a conveyor belt removes a book from a stack and drops it onto the scanner\u2019s bed. Prods mounted on a rail beneath the bed straighten the book and move it into position for the overhead camera to take a picture of the cover. Next, an arm with a pneumatic gripper opens the cover, and a metal bar comes down to hold it in place.\nThe page-turning mechanism uses two fans: one fan blows from the side of the book to ruffle the pages and separate them, while the other is mounted on a swiveling arm. This fan blows away from the page, providing a gentle suction that holds the page to the arm as it turns the page over. Finally, a glass plate descends over the book to hold the pages flat, the camera takes a picture, the glass plate retracts, and the scanner moves on to the next page.\nIt is hard to imagine, but have a look at the video in the post if you really want to see it in action.\n\nAll of the hardware, except for the camera, is controlled by an Arduino Giga using a CNC shield; the camera is directly under the control of a host computer. The host computer checks each photo to make sure it\u2019s not scanning a previously-scanned page, and if it finds that it\u2019s scanned the same page three times in a row, it assumes that the book is finished. In this case, it instructs the Arduino to close the book, takes a picture of the back cover, and moves on to the next book. The design and software for the scanner don\u2019t seem to be available yet, but [Brad] plans to give a more detailed video sometime in the future.\nWe\u2019ve seen a couple of book scanners here in the past. Some, of course, are more useful than others.\nThanks to [Stu Smith] for the tip!"}

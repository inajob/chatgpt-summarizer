[Brad Mattson] had some books to scan, but couldn\u2019t find an affordable scanner that met his needs, so he took the obvious hacker solution and built his own.\nThe scanning process starts when a conveyor belt removes a book from a stack and drops it onto the scanner\u2019s bed. Prods mounted on a rail beneath the bed straighten the book and move it into position for the overhead camera to take a picture of the cover. Next, an arm with a pneumatic gripper opens the cover, and a metal bar comes down to hold it in place.\nThe page-turning mechanism uses two fans: one fan blows from the side of the book to ruffle the pages and separate them, while the other is mounted on a swiveling arm. This fan blows away from the page, providing a gentle suction that holds the page to the arm as it turns the page over. Finally, a glass plate descends over the book to hold the pages flat, the camera takes a picture, the glass plate retracts, and the scanner moves on to the next page.\nIt is hard to imagine, but have a look at the video in the post if you really want to see it in action.\n\nAll of the hardware, except for the camera, is controlled by an Arduino Giga using a CNC shield; the camera is directly under the control of a host computer. The host computer checks each photo to make sure it\u2019s not scanning a previously-scanned page, and if it finds that it\u2019s scanned the same page three times in a row, it assumes that the book is finished. In this case, it instructs the Arduino to close the book, takes a picture of the back cover, and moves on to the next book. The design and software for the scanner don\u2019t seem to be available yet, but [Brad] plans to give a more detailed video sometime in the future.\nWe\u2019ve seen a couple of book scanners here in the past. Some, of course, are more useful than others.\nThanks to [Stu Smith] for the tip!", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe: \u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4e2d\u3001[Brad Mattson]\u306f\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u3081\u304f\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3084\u5236\u5fa1\u306fArduino\u3067\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe: \u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u672c\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "- \u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u3081\u304f\u308b\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u671f\u5f85: \u898b\u9003\u305b\u306a\u3044\u52d5\u753b\u89e3\u8aac"]}

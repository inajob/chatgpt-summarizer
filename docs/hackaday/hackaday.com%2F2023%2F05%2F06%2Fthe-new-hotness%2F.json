Or maybe it\u2019s just me.\nBack in the old times, I used to be a die-hard Atmel AVR fan for small projects, and an STM32 fan for anything larger. And I\u2019ll freely admit, I got stuck in my ways. The incredible abundance of dev boards in the $2 range also helped keep me lazy. I had my thing, and I was fine sticking with it, admittedly due to the low price of those little blue pills.\nAnd then came the drought, and like everyone else, my stockpile of microcontrollers started to dwindle. Replacements at $9 just weren\u2019t an option, so I started looking around. And it\u2019s with no small bit of shame that I\u2019ll admit that I hadn\u2019t been keeping up with the changes as much as I should have. Nowadays, it\u2019s all ESP32s and RP2040s over here, and granted there\u2019s a bit of a price bump, but the performance is there in abundance. But I can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019m a few years back of the cutting edge.\nSo when I see work like what [CNLohr] and [Bitluni] are doing with the ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontrollers, it makes me think that I need to start filling in gaps in my comfortable working-set of chips again. But how the heck am I supposed to keep up? And how do you? It took a global pandemic and silicon drought to force me out of my comfort zone last time. Can the simple allure of dirt-cheap chips get me out? We\u2019ll see!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

You wouldnt be the only one, and its a joy to see someone take the future into their own hands. [Icepat]s dream is reviving UMPCs as a concept, and hes bringing forth a pretty convincing hardware-backed argument in form of the Pocket Z project. For the hardware design, hes hired two engineers, [Adam Nowak] and [Marcin Turek], and the 7-inch Pocket Z7 version is coming up quite nicely!\nThe Hackaday.io project shows an impressive gallery of inspiration devices front and center, and with these in mind, the first version of the 7-inch UMPC sets the bar high. With a 1024600 parallel RGB (DPI) touchscreen display, an ATMega32U4-controlled keyboard, battery-ready power circuitry, and a socketed Pi Zero for brains, this device shows a promising future for the project, and we cant wait to see how it progresses.\nWhile its not a finished project just yet, this effort brings enough inspiration all around, from past device highlights to technical choices, and its worth visiting it just for the sentiment alone. Looking at our own posts, UMPCs are indeed resurfacing, after a decade-long hiatus  heres a Sidekick-like UMPC with a Raspberry Pi, that even got an impressive upgrade a year later! As for PDAs, the Sharp memory LCD and Blackberry keyboard combination has birthed a good few projects recently, and, who can forget about the last decades introductions to the scene."}

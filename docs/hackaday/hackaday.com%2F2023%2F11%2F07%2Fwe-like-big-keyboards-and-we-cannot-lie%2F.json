Like, world-class good. How good do you think youd be on a keyboard thats 16 feet long, with a space bar the size of a person? Well, youd need the rest of your team, thats for sure.\nAlienware have created the worlds largest mechanical keyboard and mouse, which are working, 14:1 scale representations of their AW420K keyboard and AW720M mouse. And they got Team Liquid to try it out.\nWhile this may be a marketing ploy, it took quite a lot of work and weeks of 3D printing to faithfully reproduce those peripherals on that scale.\nWhats really impressive are the custom key switches, which are described early on in the video after the break. They are nearly a foot wide with the keycap on, and they have an incredible four inches of travel.\nEach of the 87 key switches is made with two snugly-fitting pieces of PVC, a thick rubber band, and of course, an actual, regular-size key switch to register the presses. Not satisfied with that, the team added a small piece of measuring tape to produce a nice clicky, tactile feedback. And, oh yeah, that space bar? The stabilizer is made from a 1 copper pipe. Be sure to check it out in action after the break.\nThis just so happens to be the same size as the last keyboard we saw claiming to be the worlds largest, which was rejected from the Guinness Book because its not an exact replica of an existing keyboard. So, somebody call Guinness, we suppose.\n\n"}

Still, it has a certain retro charm were suckers for, particularly in the shape of a Commodore Datasette. Were also suckers for miniaturization, so how could we not fall for [bitluni] s tiny datasette replica?\nAesthetically, hes copying the Commodore original to get those sweet nostalgia juices flowing, but to make things more interesting hes not using compact cassette tapes. Instead, [bitluni] started with a mini cassette dictaphone, which he tore down to its essentials and rebuilt into the Commodore-shaped case.\nThe prototyping of this project was full of hacks  like building a resistor ladder DAC in an unpopulated part of a spare PCB from an unrelated project. The DAC is of course key to getting data onto the mini-casettes. After some playing around [bitluni] decided that encoding data with FSK (frequency-shift keying), as was done back on the C-64, was the way to go. (Almost like those old engineers knew what they were doing!) The dictaphone tape transport is inferior to the old Datasette, though, so as a cheap error-correction hack, [bitluni] needed to duplicate each byte to make sure it gets read correctly.\nThe mini cassettes only fit a laughable amount of data by modern standards this way (about 1 MB) but, of course thats not the point. If you jump to 11:33 in the video embedded below, you can see the point: the shout of triumph when loading PacMan (all 8 kB of it) from tape via USB. That transfer was via serial console; eventually [bitluni] intends to turn this into the worlds least-practical mass storage device, but that wasnt necessary for proof-of-concept. The code for whats shown is available on GitHub.\nIf you have an old Datasette you want to use with a modern PC, youd better believe that weve got you covered. Weve seen other cassette-mass-storage interfaces over the years, too. It might be a dead medium, but theres just something about sticky tape and rust that lives on in our imaginations.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip."}

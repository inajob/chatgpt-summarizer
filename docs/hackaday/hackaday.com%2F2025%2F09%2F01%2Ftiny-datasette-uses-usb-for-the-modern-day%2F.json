Still, it has a certain retro charm were suckers for, particularly in the shape of a Commodore Datasette. Were also suckers for miniaturization, so how could we not fall for [bitluni] s tiny datasette replica?\nAesthetically, hes copying the Commodore original to get those sweet nostalgia juices flowing, but to make things more interesting hes not using compact cassette tapes. Instead, [bitluni] started with a mini cassette dictaphone, which he tore down to its essentials and rebuilt into the Commodore-shaped case.\nThe prototyping of this project was full of hacks  like building a resistor ladder DAC in an unpopulated part of a spare PCB from an unrelated project. The DAC is of course key to getting data onto the mini-casettes. After some playing around [bitluni] decided that encoding data with FSK (frequency-shift keying), as was done back on the C-64, was the way to go. (Almost like those old engineers knew what they were doing!) The dictaphone tape transport is inferior to the old Datasette, though, so as a cheap error-correction hack, [bitluni] needed to duplicate each byte to make sure it gets read correctly.\nThe mini cassettes only fit a laughable amount of data by modern standards this way (about 1 MB) but, of course thats not the point. If you jump to 11:33 in the video embedded below, you can see the point: the shout of triumph when loading PacMan (all 8 kB of it) from tape via USB. That transfer was via serial console; eventually [bitluni] intends to turn this into the worlds least-practical mass storage device, but that wasnt necessary for proof-of-concept. The code for whats shown is available on GitHub.\nIf you have an old Datasette you want to use with a modern PC, youd better believe that weve got you covered. Weve seen other cassette-mass-storage interfaces over the years, too. It might be a dead medium, but theres just something about sticky tape and rust that lives on in our imaginations.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u518d\u73fe", "body": "\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u30cb\u304c\u30df\u30cb\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8 replic\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u518d\u73fe", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\uff01\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u30cb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u6a21\u5023\uff1aFSK\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- 1MB\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u63fa\u308b\u304c\u3059\uff01\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u6b7b\u306b\u3086\u304f\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u8a66\u307f"]}

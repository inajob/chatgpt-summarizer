During the course of making a documentary about the show, [Jacob Weldon] and [Raquel Lin] have uncovered the original digital master tapes of the show.\nThis is certainly exciting news for fans of the show, but theres a bit of a wrinkle. These digital masters are all on D-1 digital cassette tapes which the studio doesnt have a player for anymore. The dynamic duo are on the hunt for a Bosch BTS-D1 to be able to recapture some of this video for their own film while also heavily hinting to the studio that a new box set from the masters would be well-received.\nAs the first CGI TV series, Reboot has a special place in the evolution of entertainment, and while it was a technical marvel for its time, it was solid enough to last for four seasons and win numerous awards before meeting a cliffhanger ending. If youre an expert in D-1 or have a deck to lend or sell, be sure to email the creators.\nFeeling nostalgic for the electromechanical era?

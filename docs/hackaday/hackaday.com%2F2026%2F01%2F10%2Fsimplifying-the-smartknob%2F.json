It can rotate freely or with a set resistance, spring back to a fixed point when released, stick at detent points, and completely change its behavior as the interface demands. For people inexperienced in electronic assembly, though, smartknobs can be difficult to assemble. Thats why [Kokensha Tech] designed a simpler version, while at the same time letting it use a wider range of BLDC motors.\nIn addition to a motor, the original design used a magnetic encoder to detect position and a strain gauge to detect pressure on the knob. A circular LCD on the knob itself provided visual feedback, but it also required the motor to have a hollow center shaft. The LCD control wires running through the shaft proved tricky to assemble.\u00a0 [Kokensha Tech] moved the display out of the knob and onto a separate breakout board, which plugs into the controller board. This greatly broadens the range of compatible motors, since they no longer need a hollow shaft.\nThe motor now fits on a separate carrier board, which makes it easier to swap out different motors. The carrier board has mounting holes sized for a wide variety of motors, and four different types of motor connectors. [Kokensha Tech] also redesigned the rest of the PCB for easier soldering, while avoiding components with narrow pin spacing whenever possible. The original design used a LILYGO T-micro32 Plus MCU. The ESP32 is both cheaper and easier to solder, so it was a no-brainer to swap it in.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve covered the original SmartKnob before, including a more in-depth look at its design. Weve also seen another project use BLDCs and field-oriented control to make haptic knobs.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u89e6\u899a\u30ec\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u6301\u3064SmartKnob\u306e\u6982\u8981", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ce\u30d6\u306f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u89e6\u899a\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002Kokensha Tech\u306f\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3084\u3059\u3044\u6539\u826f\u7248\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u89e6\u899a\u30ec\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u6301\u3064SmartKnob\u306e\u6982\u8981", "- [Kokensha Tech]\u304c\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- BLDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- LCD\u8868\u793a\u3092\u5206\u96e2\u3057\u3066\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- ESP32\u3078\u306e\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305fPCB\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u5229\u70b9"]}

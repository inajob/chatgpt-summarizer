By making him or her a DIY masterpiece of blinking red LEDs, but in heart shape. Maybe with some custom animations, and in a nice frame with a capacitive touch sensor to turn it on or off.\nOr at least, that\u2019s what I did. The good news is that my girlfriend, now wife, understands that this sort of present comes from a place of love. And it probably didn\u2019t hurt that I also picked up some flowers to frame it with, and cooked her favorite lunch later that afternoon.\nBut if I\u2019m 100% frank with myself, I\u2019d have to admit that this was about 50% \u201cpresent\u201d and 50% \u201cproject\u201d. Of course it also helps that she gets me, and that she knows that I put a bunch of effort into making it look as good as it did, and maybe because of that she forgives the 50% project.\nValentine\u2019s day projects are a high-wire balancing act. If any other project fails, you can just try again. But here, the deadline is firm. Cosmetics matter a lot more on Valentine\u2019s day than the other 364 days of the year, too. And finally, you really have to know the gift-receiver, and be sure that you\u2019re not falling deeper into the excuse-for-a-cool-project trap than I did. And don\u2019t forget the flowers.\nI pulled it off with this one, at least, but I do feel like it was close, even today. Have you ever made a Valentine\u2019s hacking project? How\u2019d it go?\n(Note: Featured image isnt my project: Its a lot more colorful!)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

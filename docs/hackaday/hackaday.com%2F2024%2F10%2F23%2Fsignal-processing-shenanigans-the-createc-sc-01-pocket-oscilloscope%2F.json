This device, cheekily dubbed a \u201csignal computer,\u201d promises to be both intriguing and, perhaps, frustrating. You can view [Thomas] original teardown video here.\nThis device is packed with buttons and a surprisingly retro aesthetic that can make even the most seasoned hacker feel nostalgic. With a sample rate of 20 MHz and a bandwidth of up to 10 MHz, it\u2019s a digital oscilloscope with a twist. Users may find its setup challenging, thanks to a somewhat convoluted manual that boasts numerous errors. However, beneath the confusion lies the potential for creative exploration: this signal computer can analyse analog signals, perform calculations, and even store data.\nDespite its quirks, the SC 01 is sure the experience. Imagine troubleshooting a circuit while grappling with its unpredictable user interface\u2014an adventure in itself for those who like a techy challenge.\nThe Createc SC 01 is not just another tool; its an invitation to embrace the imperfections of vintage tech. If you enjoy the hands-on learning process and don\u2019t shy away from a few hiccups, this device might be something youll enjoy. Hackaday featured an article on similar devices last year. Check out the full teardown video to see this fancy but quirky pocket oscilloscope in action.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u300cCreatec SC 01\u300d", "body": "Createc SC 01\u306f\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u624b\u6301\u3061\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u51e6\u7406\u3068\u63a2\u7d22\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u300cCreatec SC 01\u300d", "- \u4fe1\u53f7\u51e6\u7406\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u300c\u4fe1\u53f7\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300d\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- \u6311\u6226\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "- \u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3055\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5192\u967a\uff1aCreatec SC 01\u3067\u306e\u5275\u9020\u7684\u63a2\u6c42"]}

Thats right, whether you were held up by Chinese fall holidays or not, heres your chance to get in on this action.\nWe love to see the add-ons people make for the badge every year, so this time around were really embracing the standard. The best SAOs will get a production run and theyll be in the swag bag at Hackaday Europe 2025.\nWhats That Sound pretty much totally stumped Kristina once again, although she kind of earned a half shirt. Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nThen its on to the hacks, beginning with what actually causes warping in 3D prints, and a really cool display wed never heard of. Then well discuss the power of POKE when it comes to live coding music on the Commodore64, and the allure of CRTs when it comes to vintage gaming.

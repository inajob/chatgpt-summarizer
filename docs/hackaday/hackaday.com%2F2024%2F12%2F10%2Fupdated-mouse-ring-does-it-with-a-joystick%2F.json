Or maybe you just want a cooler way to mouse in general. In any case, look no further than [rafgaj78]s Bluetooth Mouse Ring project.\nThis is version two, which of course comes with several improvements over version one. The biggest change is from tactile buttons to a joystick input. [rafgaj78] also did away with the power switch, using deep-sleep mode instead. Version two is easier to assemble and offers improved ergonomics, as well as a range of ring sizes.\nLike the first version, this ring runs on a Seeed Xiao nRF52840 and is programmed in CircuitPython. There are two modes to choose from. In one mode, the joystick does left and right mouse click and wheel up and down, while the push action recovers the micro from deep sleep. In the other mode, the joystick axis is a mouse pointer mover, and you push down to left click.\nWe really like this sleek design, and [rafgaj78] has great instructions if you want to build your own. This isnt the first cool mouse ring weve seen, and it certainly wont be the last."}

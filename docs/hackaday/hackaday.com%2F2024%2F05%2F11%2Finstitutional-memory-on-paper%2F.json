Voyager, the space probe. As a long-term project, he has been trying to figure out the computer systems on board. He got far enough to write up a great overview piece, and it\u2019s a pretty good summary of what we know these days. But along the way, he stumbled on a couple old documents that would answer a lot of questions.\nDan asked JPL if they had them, and the answer was \u201cno\u201d. Oddly enough, the very people who are involved in the epic save a couple weeks ago would also like a copy. So when Dan tracked the document down to a paper-only collection at Wichita State University, he thought he had won, but the whole box is stashed away as the library undergoes construction.\nThat box, and a couple of its neighbors, appear to have a treasure trove of documentation about the Voyagers, and it may even be one-of-a-kind. So in the comments, a number of people have volunteered to help the effort, but I think we\u2019re all just going to have to wait until the library is open for business again. In this age of everything-online, everything-scanned-in, it\u2019s amazing to believe that documents about the world\u2019s furthest-flown space probe wouldn\u2019t be available, but so it is!\nIt makes you wonder how many other similar documents \u2013 products of serious work by the people responsible for designing the systems and machines that shaped our world \u2013 are out there in the dark somewhere. History can\u2019t capture everything, and it\u2019s down to our collective good judgement in the end. So if you find yourself in a position to shed light on, or scan, such old papers, please do! And then contact some nerd institution like the Internet Archive or the Computer History Museum.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

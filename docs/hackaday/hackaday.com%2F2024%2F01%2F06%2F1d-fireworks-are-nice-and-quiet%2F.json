Or maybe you do it because theyre harmful to the environment, or just because its too darn cold outside. Whatever your reasoning for not setting off fireworks, dont fret  you can probably put together your own silent one-dimensional fireworks display from what youve got in the parts bin.\n[Daniel Westhof]s design is simple, requiring little more than a Wemos D1 Mini and a strip of WS2812 LEDs. Once activated, a red rocket shoots up from the ground and detonates, sending lights in both directions on the strip to imitate the bombs bursting in air. Its controlled with a small push button switch, and theres a deliciously large red LED indicator that shows the thing is ready for detonation.\nYou might be surprised to find that theres a wide array of 1D gaming and animation projects out there, many of which made possible by the ubiquitous addressable RGB LED strip. Weve seen a dungeon crawler, at least two different versions of the classic PONG, and even the makings of a simplified Wolfenstein."}

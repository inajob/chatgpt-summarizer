In fact, they hardly expose their viewers to any radiation, which makes [stoppi]\u2019s homemade spinthariscope much safer than it might first seem.\n[Stoppi] built the spinthariscope out of the eyepiece of a telescope, a silver-doped zinc sulfide phosphor screen, and the americium-241 capsule from a smoke detector. A bit of epoxy holds the phosphor screen in the lenss focal plane, and the americium capsule is mounted on a light filter and screwed onto the eyepiece. Since americium is mainly an alpha emitter, almost all of the radiation is contained within the device.\nAfter sitting in a dark room for a few minutes to let one\u2019s eyes adjust, it\u2019s possible to see small flashes of light as alpha particles hit the phosphor screen. The flashes were too faint for a smartphone camera to pick up, so [stoppi] mounted it in a light-tight metal box with a photomultiplier and viewed the signal on an oscilloscope, which revealed many small pulses.\n\nWhile a spinthariscope is a bit easier to set up, they\u2019re considerably less common among amateurs than are cloud chambers, another way to view radioactive decay. For scientific instruments, though, this project\u2019s scintillator-and-photomultiplier approach is the standard, from tiny gamma ray spectrometers to giant neutrino detectors.\n", "title": "- \u5b89\u5168\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b5\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u8cea\u306e\u5149\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3067\u304d\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u6539\u9020\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u5149\u3092oscilloscope\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u5168\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u7c92\u5b50\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u89b3\u6e2c", "- \u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3068\u5149\u96fb\u5b50\u5897\u500d\u7ba1\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

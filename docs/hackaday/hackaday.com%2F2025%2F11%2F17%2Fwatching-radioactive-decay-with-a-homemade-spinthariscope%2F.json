In fact, they hardly expose their viewers to any radiation, which makes [stoppi]\u2019s homemade spinthariscope much safer than it might first seem.\n[Stoppi] built the spinthariscope out of the eyepiece of a telescope, a silver-doped zinc sulfide phosphor screen, and the americium-241 capsule from a smoke detector. A bit of epoxy holds the phosphor screen in the lenss focal plane, and the americium capsule is mounted on a light filter and screwed onto the eyepiece. Since americium is mainly an alpha emitter, almost all of the radiation is contained within the device.\nAfter sitting in a dark room for a few minutes to let one\u2019s eyes adjust, it\u2019s possible to see small flashes of light as alpha particles hit the phosphor screen. The flashes were too faint for a smartphone camera to pick up, so [stoppi] mounted it in a light-tight metal box with a photomultiplier and viewed the signal on an oscilloscope, which revealed many small pulses.\n\nWhile a spinthariscope is a bit easier to set up, they\u2019re considerably less common among amateurs than are cloud chambers, another way to view radioactive decay. For scientific instruments, though, this project\u2019s scintillator-and-photomultiplier approach is the standard, from tiny gamma ray spectrometers to giant neutrino detectors.\n"}

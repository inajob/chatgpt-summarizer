This is believed to be one of the only working steam-powered band-sawmills in the country with a shotgun (or reciprocating) feed carriage. The carriage moves back and forth with a log while a monstrous 44-foot long bandsaw cuts pieces off on every stroke. Theres even a log turning mechanism, because if theres one thing that never changes, its that time is money.\nThere is great footage of the whole thing in action, and also a serious tour of just how much work was needed to keep such a tool running. For example, in its heyday a machine like this would be swapping bands out for maintenance and sharpening every few hours.\nViewers unfamiliar with such machinery may notice the lack of rims or guard rails on the bandsaw and other belts and pulleys. How do bands stay centered on spinning wheels without falling off? The crowned pulley was the steam eras solution, providing a means for belts to self-center without any need for rims or other additions.\nThis tour of the sawmill is a nifty peek at a technology that, at one point, ruled the roost. Watch it in action in the video, just under the page break. If that leaves you hungry to know more, theres a second video that goes into added detail about saw sharpening and more.\nOne last tip: if youre hungry to know more about the history of the steam engine, The Perfectionists is absolutely a book you should read because it goes into fascinating detail about that, and more.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for bringing this to our attention!", "title": "\u30df\u30cd\u30bd\u30bf\u5dde\u306e\u6e56\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u84b8\u6c17\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u88fd\u6750\u6240\u3092\u898b\u5b66\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u30df\u30cd\u30bd\u30bf\u5dde\u306eItasca\u6e56\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3001\u4e57\u7528\u30c4\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u84b8\u6c17\u5f0f\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30bd\u30fc\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u306f\u4f5c\u52d5\u4e2d\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u304c\u898b\u3089\u308c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7dad\u6301\u306b\u306f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u52b4\u529b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u88dc\u52a9\u5177\u304c\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u56de\u8ee2\u8eca\u4e0a\u306b\u4fdd\u305f\u308c\u308b\u306e\u304b\u3082\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u304b\u3064\u3066\u4e3b\u6d41\u3060\u3063\u305f\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u8997\u304d\u898b\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30cd\u30bd\u30bf\u5dde\u306e\u6e56\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u84b8\u6c17\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u88fd\u6750\u6240\u3092\u898b\u5b66\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u7a3c\u50cd\u4e2d\u306e\u84b8\u6c17\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30bd\u30fc\u30df\u30eb\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30bd\u30fc\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u8996\u8074\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u84b8\u6c17\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u88fd\u6750\u6240\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "\u84b8\u6c17\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u88fd\u6750\u6240\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308a\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u3078\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u60c5\u5831\u6e90"]}

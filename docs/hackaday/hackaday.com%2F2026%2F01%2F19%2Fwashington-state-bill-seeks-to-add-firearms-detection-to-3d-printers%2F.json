Sponsored by a sizeable number of House members, its currently in committee, so the likelihood of it being put to a floor vote in the House is still remote, never mind it passing the Senate. Regardless, it is another chapter in the story of homemade firearms, which increasingly focuses on private 3D printers.\nAlso called ghost guns in the US, these can be assembled from spare parts, from kits, from home-made components, or a combination of these. While the most important parts of a firearm  like the barrel  have to be made out of something like metal, the rest can feature significant amounts of (3D printed) plastic parts, though the exact amount varies wildly among current 3D-printed weapons.\nSince legally the receiver and frame are considered to be firearms, these are the focus of this proposed bill, which covers both additive (FDM, SLA, etc.) and subtractive (e.g. CNC mill) technology. The proposal is that a special firearms detection algorithm has to give the okay for the design files to be passed on to the machine.\n\nThis blocking feature would have to be standard for all machines sold or transferred in the state, with a special preprint authentication handshake protocol required. The attorney general is here expected to create and maintain a database of the no longer legal firearm and parts designs for those without a requisite license.\nPutting aside for a moment the ridiculousness of implementing such a scanning feature, even if it wouldnt be childs play to circumvent with e.g a compatible SBC and fresh copy of Klipper or the equivalent for any CNC mill, it also barks up the wrong tree. Although in the most recent ruling pertaining to this topic in Bondi v.\u00a0VanDerStok it was acknowledged that advances in 3D printing have made this worth considering from a legislative context, the main issue with ghost guns comes still by far from kits and similar sources.\nBased on this, it seems highly unlikely that HB 2321 will be put up for a vote, never mind get signed into law. Although 3D printed designs like the 919 mm cartridge Urutau bullpup are apparently quite functional, its notable that its manufacturing involves many steps, many DIY store parts and a bolt carrier manufactured from steel bar stock, not to mention a significant time investment. Trying to detect firearm parts at any of these steps would seem to be a fools errand, even if privacy considerations were not an issue.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9283\u5668\u88fd\u9020\u898f\u5236\u6cd5\u6848\u304c\u8b70\u8ad6\u3092\u547c\u3076", "body": "\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u5dde\u306eHB 2321\u6cd5\u6848\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9283\u5668\u88fd\u9020\u3092\u9632\u3050\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6280\u8853\u5c0e\u5165\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u6210\u7acb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9283\u5668\u88fd\u9020\u898f\u5236\u6cd5\u6848\u304c\u8b70\u8ad6\u3092\u547c\u3076", "\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u5dde\u306eHB 2321\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9283\u5668\u88fd\u9020\u3092\u963b\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u307f", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u9283\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u73fe\u72b6", "\u9283\u5668\u691c\u51fa\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u5c0e\u5165\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3068\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u72ed\u9593\u3067\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u898f\u5236\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055"]}

Unfortunately, while its easy to\u00a0 get something up and running in Python, its performance compared to other languages is generally lacking. Often, when starting out, were just happy to have our code run successfully. Eventually, though, performance always becomes a priority. When that happens for you, you might like to check out the nifty tips from [Evgenia Verbina] on how to make your Python code faster.\nMany of the tricks are simple common sense. For example, its useful to avoid creating duplicates of large objects in memory, so altering an object instead of copying it can save a lot of processing time. Another easy win is using the Python math module instead of using the exponent (**) operator since math calls some C code that runs super fast. Others may be unfamiliar to new coders\u2014like the benefits of using sets instead of lists for faster lookups, particularly when it comes to working with larger datasets. These sorts of efficiency gains might be merely useful, or they might be a critical part of making sure your project is actually practical and fit for purpose.\nIts worth looking over the whole list, even if youre an intermediate coder. You might find some easy wins that drastically improve your code for minimal effort. Weve explored similar tricks for speeding up code on embedded platforms like Arduino, too.

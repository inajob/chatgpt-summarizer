For one thing, its blue, and outside of the short-lived animated series The Real Ghostbusters, who ever heard of a blue proton pack? So one major change was to paint it matte black and age it with the old silver rub n buff technique. And of course, add all the necessary stickers.\n[Tom] added plenty of blinkenlights, all running off of an Arduino Nano clone and a pair of 18650s. He got lucky with the whole power cell thing, because an 8 x 5050 RGB LED stick fits there perfectly and looks great behind a PETG diffusing lens. He also drilled out and lit up the cyclotron, because whats a proton pack without that? Theres even a 7-segment LED voltmeter so Dad can check the power level throughout the night.\nFinally, he had to do a bit of engineering to make the thing actually wearable by his daughter. A frame made of square aluminium tubing adds strength, and a new pair of padded straps make it comfortable. Be sure to check it out in action after the break.\nWhats a Ghostbusters costume without a PKE meter?\u00a0 \n\n \n\n"}

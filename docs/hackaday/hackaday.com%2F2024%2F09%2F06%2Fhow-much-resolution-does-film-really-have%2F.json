Then youve probably wondered about the resolution of your scanner, versus the resolution of what youre actually scanning. Or maybe, youve looked at digital cameras, and wondered how many megapixels make up that 35mm film shot. Well [ShyStudios] has been pondering these very questions, and theyve shared some answers.\nThe truth is that film doesnt really have a specific equivalent resolution to a digital image, as its an analog medium that has no pixels. Instead, color is represented by photoreactive chemicals. Still, there are ways to measure its resolution\u2014normally done in lines/mm, in the simplest sense.\n[ShyStudios] provides a full explanation of what this means, as well as more complicated ways of interpreting analog film resolution. Translating this into pixel equivalents is messy, but [ShyStudios] does some calculations to put a 35mm FujiColor 200 print around the 54 megapixel level. Fancier films can go much higher.\nOf course, there are limitations to film, and you have to use it properly. But still, it gives properly impressive resolution even compared to modern cameras. As it turns out, weve been talking about film a lot lately! Video after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!"}

It looks like an intuitive and comfortable design that can adapt to a wide variety of solder thicknesses, and is entirely 3D printed.\nOne part we particularly like is the feed system. One rolls a wheel which feeds solder out using a mechanism a lot like extrusion gears in many 3D printer hot ends. Both wheels have ridged surfaces that grip and feed the solder; their gears mesh with one another so that moving one moves both in unison.\nSolder feed tools like this have seen all kinds of interesting designs, because while the problem is the same for everyone, there are all kinds of different ways to go about addressing it. We love this one, and we have seen many other takes that range from a powered, glove-mounted unit to an extremely simple tool with no moving parts. Weve even seen a method of hacking a mechanical pencil into a new role as a solder feeder.", "title": "Victor\u88fd\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3001\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300c\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "body": "\u624b\u6301\u3061\u306e\u300cSolder Scroll\u300d\u306f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u56de\u3059\u3060\u3051\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u306f\u3093\u3060\u306e\u539a\u3055\u306b\u9069\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u7279\u306b\u597d\u8a55\u3067\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Victor\u88fd\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3001\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300c\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u624b\u6301\u3061\u578b\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u76f4\u611f\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3"]}

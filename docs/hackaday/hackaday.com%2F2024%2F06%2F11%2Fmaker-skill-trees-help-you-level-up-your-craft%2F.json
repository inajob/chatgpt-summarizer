[Steph Piper] is here with her Maker Skill Trees to give you a map to leveling up your skills.\nFeaturing a grid of 73 hexagonal tiles per discipline, theres plenty of inspiration for what to tackle next in your journey. The trees start with the basics at the bottom and progressively move up in difficulty as you move up the page. With over 50 trees to select from (so far), you can probably find something to help you become better at anything from 3D printing and modeling to entrepreneurship or woodworking.\nDespite being spoiled for choice, if youre disappointed theres no tree for your particular interest (underwater basket weaving?), you can roll your own with the provided template and submit it for inclusion in the repository.\nWant to get a jump on an AI Skill Tree? Try out these AI courses. Maybe you could use these to market yourself to potential employers or feel confident enough to strike out on your own?\n[Thanks to Courtney for the tip!]\n\n\n"}

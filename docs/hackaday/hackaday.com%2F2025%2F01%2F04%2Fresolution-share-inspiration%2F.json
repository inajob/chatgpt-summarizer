I just got back from Chaos Communication Congress, which is easily my favorite gigantic hacker conference of the year. (Partisan Hackaday pride puts Supercon up as my favorite moderate-sized conference, naturally.) CCC is huge. And it\u2019s impossible to leave an event like that without your to-hack list at least doubling in length.\nAnd then I got back home and started prepping up for the podcast, which meant reading through about a week\u2019s worth of Hackaday in a single sitting. Which in turn adds a few more projects to the list. Thanks for that, y\u2019all!\nAll of this was possible because people who do crazy nerdy things decided to share their passions with everyone. So in the spirit of the New Year, I\u2019m going to try to document my own projects a little bit better, because if people can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing, they can\u2019t get inspired by it.\nAnd while it\u2019s my day job, it\u2019s not yours, so I\u2019d like to encourage you to point out a cool project if you see it as well. Because what\u2019s better than inspiring other hackers to pick up the torch on a project you love?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Its even more difficult to get accessories like RAM expansions and graphics cards, because half the time theyre just discarded as random e-waste when theyre outside of their original context. [na103] has solved this problem for the DEC Rainbow 100 to a degree, by building new RAM expansions and graphics cards from scratch.\nIn the case of the RAM expansion, the design [na103] built is capable of boosting a Rainbow 100 computer to a full 896KB. This is more than other contemporary IBM machines like the 8088 XT, which had an architecture-enforced limit of 640 KB.\u00a0 It was rebuilt from some notes and original DEC schematics.\nThe GS2 graphics card was recreated in a similar fashion, also relying on some photos snagged from the internet. Its GALs and PROMs are programmed using rips from an original board. While the design is considered complete, [na103] hasnt yet had the opportunity to build and test it yet.\nThe trick is, armed with the right documentation, its not actually that impossible to recreate old hardware yourself. If youve been whipping up something similar in your own workshop, dont hesitate to drop us a line!\n", "title": "\u300c\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "DEC Rainbow 100\u5411\u3051\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044RAM\u62e1\u5f35\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u6700\u5927896KB\u306eRAM\u5bb9\u91cf\u306f\u4ed6\u306eIBM\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3088\u308a\u3082\u591a\u3044\u3002\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u306fDEC\u306e\u56f3\u9762\u3084\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u4e0a\u306e\u5199\u771f\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u307e\u3060\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cDEC Rainbow 100\u306eRAM\u62e1\u5f35\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u65b0\u305f\u306b\u4f5c\u308a\u76f4\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u300d", "\u300cContemporary IBM machines\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5148\u9032\u7684\u306aDEC Rainbow 100\u306e896KB RAM\u62e1\u5f35\u300d", "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6b63\u3057\u3044\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u300d"]}

It makes sense when you think about it; our atmosphere is so thick and so loaded with water vapor and reactive oxygen that it just has to play havoc with experiments. Even when the goal is more applied than empirical, getting rid of all those pesky molecules is often the first step in getting good results.\nBut pulling a vacuum is rarely an easy task. Sure you can pump out some of the air, but that just makes the rest of the atmosphere try really hard to get back inside and ruin your day. It takes a lot of specialized equipment, a lot of precision-machined stainless steel fittings, and quite a bit of experience not only to pull a vacuum, but to then be able to work within it and do something useful.\nOne place where weve seen a lot of high-vacuum action is over on Advanced Tinkering on YouTube. The channel has a wealth of interesting experiments, many of which need a good vacuum to get going. To that end, channel owner Niklas has assembled a nice collection of vacuum gear, and we asked him to drop by the Hack Chat to talk about what hes learned by embracing the suck.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, March 6 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.", "title": "Advanced Tinkering\u306eNiklas\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "3\u67086\u65e5\u306e\u6b63\u5348\u306b\u3001Advanced Tinkering\u304b\u3089Niklas\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u9ad8\u771f\u7a7a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01\u5b9f\u9a13\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u3067\u306f\u771f\u7a7a\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3001\u771f\u7a7a\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u5bb9\u6613\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002Advanced Tinkering\u306eYouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u306f\u3001\u771f\u7a7a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u5c02\u9580\u7684\u306a\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["Advanced Tinkering\u306eNiklas\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u9ad8\u771f\u7a7a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u88c5\u5099\u3084\u7d4c\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u771f\u7a7a\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308b", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u673a\u4f1a"]}

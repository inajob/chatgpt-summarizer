Dishwashers had been attempted before, but hers was the first with the revolutionary idea of using water pressure to clean dishes placed in wire racks, rather than relying on some sort of physical scrubber. The very first KitchenAid household dishwashers were based on her machines, making modern dishwashers direct descendants of her original design.\nJosephine Cochrane (n\u00e9e Garis)\nIt wasnt an overnight success. Josephine faced many hurdles. Saying it was difficult for a woman to start a venture or do business during this period of history doesnt do justice to just how many barriers existed, even discounting the fact that her late husband was something we would today recognize as a violent alcoholic. One who left her little money and many debts upon his death, to boot.\nShe was nevertheless able to focus on developing her machine, and eventually hired mechanic George Butters to help create a prototype. The two of them working in near secrecy because a man being seen regularly visiting her home was simply asking for trouble. Then there were all the challenges of launching a product in a business world that had little place for a woman. One can sense the weight of it all in a quote from Josephine (shared in a write-up by the USPTO) in which she says If I knew all I know today when I began to put the dishwasher on the market, I never would have had the courage to start.\nBut Josephine persevered and her invention made a stir at the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago, winning an award and mesmerizing onlookers. Not only was it invented by a woman, but her dishwashers were used by restaurants on-site to clean tens of thousands of dishes, day in and day out. Her marvelous machine was not yet a household device, but restaurants, hotels, colleges, and hospitals all saw the benefits and lined up to place orders.\n\nEarly machines were highly effective, but they were not the affordable, standard household appliances they are today. There certainly existed a household demand for her machine  dishwashing was a tedious chore that no one enjoyed  but household dishwashing was a task primarily done by women. Women did not control purchasing decisions, and it was difficult for men of the time (who did not spend theirs washing dishes) to be motivated about the benefits. The device was expensive, but it did away with a tremendous amount of labor. Surely the price was justified? Yet women themselves  the ones who would benefit the most  were often not on board. Josephine reflected that many women did not yet seem to think of their own time and comfort as having intrinsic value.\nJosephine Cochrane ran a highly successful business and continued to refine her designs. She died in 1913 and it wasnt until the 1950s that dishwashers  direct descendants of her original design  truly started to become popular with the general public.\nNowadays, dishwashers are such a solved problem that not only are they a feature in an instructive engineering story, but we rarely see anyone building one (though it has happened.)\nWe have Josephine Cochrane to thank for that. Not just her intellect and ingenuity in coming up with it, but the fact that she persevered enough to bring her creation over the finish line."}

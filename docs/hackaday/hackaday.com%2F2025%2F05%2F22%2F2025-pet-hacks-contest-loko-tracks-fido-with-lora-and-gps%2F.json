The project dates all the way back to 2019 on Hackaday.io, and through its logs you can see its evolution up to the announcement that Loko is available from SeeedStudio.\nIts not a device necessarily limited to pets. In fact, the original use case appears to have been a backup locator beacon for lost drones. But its still a good fit for the contest none-the-less: at 12 grams, the tiny tracking device wont bother even the most diminutive of pups, and will fit on any collar at only 30 mm x 23 mm. The ground station that pairs with your phone is a bit bigger, of course, but unless you have a Newfoundlander or a St. Bernard youre likely bigger than fido. The devices use LoRa to provide a range up to 15 km  maybe better if you can loop them into a LoRaWAN. Depending on how often you pin the tracker, it can apparently last for as long as 270 days, which we really hope you wont need to track a missing pet.\nThe hardware is based around Seeeds Wio-E5 LoRa chip, which packages an STM32 with a LoRA radio. The firmware is written in MicroPython, and everything is available via GitHub under the MIT license. Though the code for the mobile app that interfaces with that hardware doesnt appear to be in the repository at the moment. (There are folders, but theyre disappointingly empty.) The apps are available free on the iOS App Store and Google Play, however.\nTheres still plenty of time to submit your own hacks to the Pet Hacks Contest, so please do! You have until April 25th, so if you havent started yet, its not too late to get hacking.\n \n\n", "title": "- \u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aLoRa/GPS\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u300cLoko\u300d\u306e\u6210\u529f\u7269\u8a9e", "body": " Loko\u306fLoRa/GPS\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3084\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u8ffd\u8de1\u3092\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aLoRa/GPS\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u300cLoko\u300d\u306e\u6210\u529f\u7269\u8a9e", "- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u8efd\u91cf\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3001 Loko \u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- MicroPython\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u5730\u4e0a\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068LoRa\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u52df\u96c6\u4e2d"]}

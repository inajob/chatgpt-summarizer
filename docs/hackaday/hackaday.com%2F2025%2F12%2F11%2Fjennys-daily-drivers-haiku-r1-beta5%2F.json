Apple were still in their period in the doldrums waiting for Steve Jobs to return with his NeXT, while other would-be challengers such as IBMs OS/2 or Commodores Amiga were sinking into obscurity.\nInto this unpromising marketplace came Be inc, with their BeBox computer and its very nice BeOS operating system. To try it out as we did at a trade show some time in the late 90s was to step into a very polished multitasking multimedia OS, but sadly one which failed to gather sufficient traction to survive. The story ended in the early 2000s as Be were swallowed by Palm, and a dedicated band of BeOS enthusiasts set about implementing a free successor OS. This has become Haiku, and while its not BeOS it retains API compatibility with and certainly feels a lot like its inspiration. Its been on my list for a Daily Drivers article for a while now, so its time to download the ISO and give it a go. Im using the AMD64 version.\nA Joy To Use, After A Few Snags\nIf you ignore the odd font substitution in WebPositive, its a competent browser.\nThis isnt the first time Ive given Haiku a go in an attempt to write about it for this series, and I have found it consistently isnt happy with my array of crusty old test laptops. So this time I pulled out something newer, my spare Lenovo Thinkpad X280. I was pleased to see that the Haiku installation USB volume booted and ran fine on this machine, and I was soon at the end of the install and ready to start my Haiku journey.\nHere I hit my first snag, because sadly the OS hadnt quite managed to set up its UEFI booting correctly. I thus found myself unexpectedly in a GRUB prompt, as the open source bootloader was left in place from a previous Linux install. Fixing this wasnt too onerous as I was able to copy the relevant Haiku file to my UEFI partition, but it was a little unexpected. On with the show then, and in to Haiku.\nIn use, this operating system is a joy. Its desktop look and feel is polished, in a late-90s sense. There was nothing jarring or unintuitive, and though I had never used Haiku before I was never left searching for what I needed. It feels stable too, I was expecting the occasional crash or freeze, but none came. When I had to use the terminal to move the UEFI file it felt familiar to me as a Linux user, and all my settings were easy to get right.\nNever Mind My Network Card\nIf only the network setup on my Thinkpad was as nice as the one in the VM.\nI hit a problem when it came to network setup though, I found its wireless networking to be intermittent. I could connect to my network, but while DHCP would give it an IP address it failed to pick up the gateway and thus wasnt a useful external connection. I could fix this by going to a fixed IP address and entering the gateway and DNS myself, and that gave me a connection, but not a reliable one. I would have it for a minute or two, and then it would be gone. Enough time for a quick software update and to load Hackaday on its WebPositive web browser, but not enough time to do any work. Were tantalisingly close to a useful OS here, and I dont want this review to end on that note.\nThe point of this series has been to try each OS in as real a situation as possible, to do my everyday Hackaday work of writing articles and manipulating graphics. I have used real hardware to achieve this, a motley array of older PCs and laptops. As Ive described in previous paragraphs Ive reached the limits of what I can do on real hardware due to the network issue, but I still want to give this one a fair evaluation. I have thus here for the first time used a test subject in a VM rather than on real hardware. What follows then is courtesy of Gnome Boxes on my everyday Linux powerhouse, so please excuse the obvious VM screenshots.\nThis One Is A True Daily Driver\nTheres plenty of well-ported software, but nothing too esoteric.\nWith a Haiku install having a working network connection, it becomes an easy task to install software updates, and install new software. The library has fairly up-to-date versions of many popular packages, so I was easily able to install GIMP and LibreOffice. WebPositive is WebKit-based and up-to-date enough that the normally-picky Hackaday back-end doesnt complain at me, so it more than fulfils my Daily Drivers\u00a0 requirement for an everyday OS I can do my work on. In fact, the 90s look-and-feel and the Wi-Fi issues notwithstanding, this OS feels stable and solid in a way that many of the other minority OSes Ive tried do not. I could use this day-to-day, and the Haiku Thinkpad could accompany me on the road.\nThere is a snag though, and its not the fault of the Haiku folks but probably a function of the size of their community; this is a really great OS, but sadly there are software packages it simply doesnt have available for it. Theyve concentrated on multimedia, the web, games, and productivity in their choice of software to port, and some of the more esoteric or engineering-specific stuff I use is unsurprisingly not there. I can not fault them for this given the obvious work thats gone into this OS, but its something to consider if your needs are complex.\nHaiku then, its a very nice desktop operating system thats polished, stable, and a joy to use. Excuse it a few setup issues and take care to ensure your Wi-Fi card is on its nice list, and you can use it day-to-day. It will always have something of the late 90s about it, but think of that as not a curse but the operating system some of us wished we could have back in the real late 90s. Ill be finding a machine to hang onto a Haiku install, this one bears further experimentation."}

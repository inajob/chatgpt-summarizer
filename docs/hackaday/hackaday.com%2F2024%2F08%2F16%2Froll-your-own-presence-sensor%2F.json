Therefore, he decided to create his own. The kit uses a millimeter wave sensor as a super-sensitive motion tracker for up to three people. It can even read your heart rate remotely. You can see a video of the project below.\nThere are a few differences from the original kit. Both use the C4001 24 GHz human presence detection sensor. However, the homebrew version also includes a BME680 environmental sensor.\n\nIf you havent seen a millimeter wave sensor\u2014often written mmwave\u2014before, it is essentially a tiny radar that can measure movement, acceleration, and angles very accurately. They are available at different microwave wavelengths and have onboard processing to easily provide useful information for a processor like the one in this project. The processor on board is an ESP32, which works well with [Mellow_Labs] home automation system.\nA 3D-printed case rounds everything out. Circuit-wise, there isnt much going on since everything is on a module PCB. You essentially just have to connect everything together.\nThese sensors can do a lot of things. For example, inspecting pipelines. Another common way to detect people is to use a specialized camera.\n", "title": "DIY\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eEverything Presence Lite\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eEverything Presence Lite\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u3001\u30df\u30ea\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u74b0\u5883\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u30013\u4eba\u307e\u3067\u306e\u5fc3\u62cd\u6570\u3092\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u8ffd\u8de1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eEverything Presence Lite\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30df\u30ea\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u5b85\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30df\u30ea\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u904b\u52d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5b8c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

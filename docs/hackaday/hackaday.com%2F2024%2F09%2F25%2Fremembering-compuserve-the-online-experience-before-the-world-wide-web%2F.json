In an article by [Michael De Bonis] a listener-submitted question to WOSUs\u00a0Curious Cbus is answered, interspersed with recollections of former users of the service. So what was CompuServes contribution to society that was so important that the state of Ohio gave historical status to the building that once housed this company?\nThe history of CompuServe and the consumer-facing services which it would develop started in 1969, when it was a timesharing and remote access service for businesses who wanted to buy some time on the PDP-10s that Golden United Life Insurance as the companys subsidiary used. CompuServe divested in 1975 to become its own, NASDAQ-listed company. As noted in the article, while selling timeshares to businesses went well, after business hours they would have these big computer systems sitting mostly idly. This was developed by 1979 into a plan to give consumers with their newfangled microcomputers like the TRS-80 access.\nOriginally called MicroNet and marketed by Radio Shack, the service offered the CompuServe menu to users when they logged in, giving access to features like email, weather, stock quotes, online shipping and booking of airline tickets, as well as online forums and interactive text games.\nLater renamed to CompuServe Information Service (CIS), it remained competitive with competitors like AOL and Prodigy until the mid-90s, even buying one competitor called The Source. Ultimately it was the rise of Internet and the WWW that would close the door on this chapter of computing history, even as for CompuServe users this new Internet age would have felt very familiar, indeed.", "title": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u767b\u5834\u524d\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9", "body": "1981\u5e747\u6708\u306eCompuServes\u8a8c\u306e\u8868\u7d19\u3002\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3084World Wide Web\u304c\u5e83\u307e\u308b\u524d\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u30011979\u5e749\u670824\u65e5\u306b\u30aa\u30cf\u30a4\u30aa\u306eCompuServe\u304c\u521d\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u8005\u5411\u3051\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3084\u63d0\u4f9b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u304c\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u767b\u5834\u524d\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9", "\u30b3\u30e0\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\uff1a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u3051", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u8ca2\u732e\uff1a\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u8005", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e9\u30e0\u3068\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u60c5\u5831\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\uff08CIS\uff09\uff1a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u5230\u6765\u524d\u591c"]}

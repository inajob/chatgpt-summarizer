As with other OSS projects like the GIMP, these OSS takes on commercial software do not always follow established user interactions (UX), which is where Ondsel sought to bridge the gap by giving commercial CAD users a more accessible FreeCAD experience. This effort is now however at an end, with a blog post by Ondsel core team member [Brad Collette] providing the details.\nThe idea of commercializing OSS is by no means novel, as this is what Red Hat and many others have done for decades now. In our article on FOSS development bounties we touched upon the different funding models for FOSS projects, with the Linux kernel enjoying strong commercial support. The trick is of course to attract such commercial support and associated funding, which is where the development on the UI/UX and feature set of the core FreeCAD code base was key. Unfortunately the business case was not strong enough to attract such commercial partners and Ondsel has been shutdown.\nAs also discussed on the FreeCAD forum, the Ondsel codebase will likely be at least partially merged into the FreeCAD code, ending for now the prospect of FreeCAD playing in the big leagues with the likes of AutoCAD.\nThanks to [Brian Harrington] for the tip.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9CAD\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aFreeCAD\u3068Ondsel\u306e\u7269\u8a9e  ", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9CAD\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8Ondsel\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3002FreeCAD\u306e\u5546\u696d\u5316\u306f\u96e3\u822a\u3057\u3001\u4e3b\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u7d71\u5408\u3055\u308c\u308b\u898b\u8fbc\u307f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9CAD\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aFreeCAD\u3068Ondsel\u306e\u7269\u8a9e  ", "Ondsel\u306e\u9589\u9396\uff1a\u5546\u696d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u305fFreeCAD\u652f\u63f4\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d42\u7109  ", "\u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u6a4b\u6e21\u3057\uff1a\u5546\u696dCAD\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3078\u306eFreeCAD\u4f53\u9a13\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u8a66\u307f  ", "FOSS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u8cc7\u91d1\u8abf\u9054\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3068\u5546\u696d\u7684\u652f\u63f4\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027  ", "FreeCAD\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1aOndsel\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5c55\u671b"]}

However, the hardware is generic enough that it could work as a weather station or even a task scheduler.\nThe project makes good use of modules, so there isnt much to build. A Waveshare 2.9-inch e-ink panel and an ESP32, along with a power supply, are all you need. The real work is in the software. Of course, you also need a box to put it in, but with 3D printing, thats hardly a problem.\nWell, it isnt a problem unless  like [Markus]  you dont have a 3D printer. Instead, he built a wooden case that also holds notepaper.\nThe software uses ESPHome to interface with Home Assistant. There is a fair amount of configuration, but nothing too difficult. Of course, you can customize the display to your hearts content. Overall, this is a great example of how a few modular components and some open-source software can combine to make a very simple yet useful project.\nThere are many ways to use an ESP32 in your home automation setup. Maybe you can salvage the e-ink displays. Just try not to get carried away."}

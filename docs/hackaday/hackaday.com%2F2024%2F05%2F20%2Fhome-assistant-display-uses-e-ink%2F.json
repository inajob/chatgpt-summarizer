However, the hardware is generic enough that it could work as a weather station or even a task scheduler.\nThe project makes good use of modules, so there isnt much to build. A Waveshare 2.9-inch e-ink panel and an ESP32, along with a power supply, are all you need. The real work is in the software. Of course, you also need a box to put it in, but with 3D printing, thats hardly a problem.\nWell, it isnt a problem unless  like [Markus]  you dont have a 3D printer. Instead, he built a wooden case that also holds notepaper.\nThe software uses ESPHome to interface with Home Assistant. There is a fair amount of configuration, but nothing too difficult. Of course, you can customize the display to your hearts content. Overall, this is a great example of how a few modular components and some open-source software can combine to make a very simple yet useful project.\nThere are many ways to use an ESP32 in your home automation setup. Maybe you can salvage the e-ink displays. Just try not to get carried away.", "title": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "ESP32\u3068E\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u3001\u4f5c\u6210\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3002ESPHome\u3067Home Assistant\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3002\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7528\u9014\u5411\u3051\u306eESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u69cb\u7bc9", "ESP32\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u3084\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u30b9\u30b1\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u6728\u88fd\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Home Assistant\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\uff1aESPHome\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a6\u30a7\u30b6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

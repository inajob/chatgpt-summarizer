Given that he already owned two TS101 soldering irons, a 3D printer, and knows how to use FreeCAD (he had just finished designing a custom TS101 holder) it didnt take long to create cost-effective DIY soldering tweezers.\nTwo screws allow adjusting the irons to ensure the tips line up perfectly.\nThe result works great! The TS101 irons are a friction-fit and the hinge (designed using the that-looks-about-right method) worked out just fine on the first try. Considering two TS101 irons are still cheaper than any soldering tweezer he could find, and one can simply undock the TS101s as needed, we call this a solid win.\nOne feature we really like is being able to precisely adjust the depth of each iron relative to each other, so that the tips can be made to line up perfectly. A small screw and nut at the bottom end of each holder takes care of that. Its a small but very thoughtful design feature.\nWant to give it a try? The FreeCAD design file (and .stl model) is available from [Mitxela]s project page. Just head to the bottom to find the links.\nWeve seen DIY soldering tweezers using USB soldering irons from eBay but the TS101 has a form factor that seems like a particularly good fit.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u7528\u30d4\u30f3\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aTS101\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "Mitxela\u304cTS101\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3054\u3066\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3054\u3066\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u8abf\u6574\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u7528\u30d4\u30f3\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aTS101\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u3054\u3066\u7528\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u7cbe\u5bc6\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306aDIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u30d4\u30f3\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "TS101\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u3054\u3066\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u7121\u6599\u306eFreeCAD\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b"]}

Their advanced engine technology may have taken decades to reach the point of sustainable testing, but it held the promise of one day delivering true spaceplanes able to take off from a runway and fly to the edge of the atmosphere before continuing to orbit. It seems their demise is due to a failure to secure more funding.\nWeve written about their work more than once in the past, of their hybrid engines and the development of the advanced cooling system required to deliver air to a jet engine working at extreme speeds.\u00a0 The rights to this tech will no doubt survive the company, and given that its origins lie in a previously canceled British Aerospace project its not impossible that it might return. The dream of a short flight from London to Sydney may be on hold for now then.\nWriting this from the UK theres a slight air of sadness about this news, but given that its not the first time a British space effort has failed, we should be used to it by now.\nHeader: Science Museum London / Science and Society Picture Library, CC BY-SA 2.0", "title": "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u63a8\u9032\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c55\u671b\u3068\u53cd\u97ff", "body": "\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u63a8\u9032\u4f01\u696d\u304c\u8cc7\u91d1\u96e3\u3067\u5012\u7523\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5922\u304c\u9060\u306e\u304f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u63a8\u9032\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c55\u671b\u3068\u53cd\u97ff", "- \u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u53d6\u5f15\u505c\u6b62\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u5922\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u308b\uff1f", "- \u5148\u9032\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u304c\u76f4\u9762\u3057\u305f\u8cc7\u91d1\u4e0d\u8db3\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u60b2\u5287\u3068\u305d\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- \u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u77ed\u8ddd\u96e2\u98db\u884c\u306e\u5922\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u304a\u9810\u3051"]}

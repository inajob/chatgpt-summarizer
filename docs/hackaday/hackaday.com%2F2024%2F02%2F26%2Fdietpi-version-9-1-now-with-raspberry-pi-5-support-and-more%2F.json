The Radxa Rock 4 SE image was necessary because the Rock 4s RK3399 SoC is subtly different from the RK3399-Ts SoC in terms of memory support, which prevents a Rock 4 image from booting on the Rock 4 SE. Meanwhile the Raspberry Pi 5 image is all new and still a bit rough around the edges, with features like the changing of the resolution and camera module support not working yet. These new images are all available for testing.\nWe covered DietPi previously with their 8.12 release, along with the reasons why you might want to use DietPi over Armbian and Raspberry Pi OS. Essentially DietPis main focus is on performance combined with a small installed size, with the included configuration tools and the setup allowing for many more features to be tweaked than you usually find. If the performance improvements, lower RAM usage and faster boot times seen with the Raspberry Pi 4 holds up, then DietPi can just give the Raspberry Pi 5 a nice little boost, while saving power in the process.\nThanks to [StephanStS] for the tip.", "title": "DietPi\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f39.1\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u308b", "body": "DietPi\u304c9.1\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3002Raspberry Pi 5\u3001Radxa Rock 4 SE\u3001NanoPi R5S/R5C 6\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["DietPi\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f39.1\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u308b", "Raspberry Pi 5\u3001Radxa Rock 4 SE\u3001NanoPi R5S/R5C 6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0", "Raspberry Pi 5\u7528\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u306f\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u304c\u3042\u308a", "DietPi\u306fArmbian\u3084Raspberry Pi OS\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u91cd\u70b9", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044DietPi\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7528\u306b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd"]}

[Davis Dewitt] proves that second statement with his RC movie star robot for an upcoming feature film.\nThe video takes us through the design process, including what its like to work with studio concept artists. As for the robot, its controlled by an Arduino Nano, lots of servos, and a COTS airplane R/C controller, all powered by li-po batteries. This is inside an artfully weathered and painted 3D printed body. Apparently weathering is important to make the character look like a well-loved good guy. (Shiny is evil, who knew?) Hats off to [Davis] for replicating that weathering for an identical stunt double.\nCheck out the video below for all the deets, or you can watch to see if The Lightening Code is coming to a theater near you. If youre into films, this isnt the first hack [Davis]\u00a0has made for the silver screen. If you prefer real hacks to props, his Soviet-Era Nixie clock would look great on any desk. Thanks to [Davis] for letting us know about this project via the tips line.\n\n", "title": "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u6620\u753b\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bCG\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u6620\u753b\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bCG\u306e\u5897\u52a0\u3068\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u7279\u64ae\u306e\u8870\u9000\u304c\u554f\u984c\u8996\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u6620\u753b\u7528\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304cArduino\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u73fe\u4ee3\u6620\u753b\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bCG\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- Davis Dewitt\u306b\u3088\u308bRC\u6620\u753b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6620\u753b\u7528\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u5929\u5019\u5909\u5316\u304c\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5370\u8c61\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u6620\u753b\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

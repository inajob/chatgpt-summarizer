We have to admit, we know what a thermin is, but thats as far as we got. Youve surely seen and heard a theremin, the musical instrument developed by Leon Theremin that makes swoopy music often associated with science fiction movies. The luminiferous variation is a similar instrument that uses modern time of flight sensors to pick up your hand positions.\nThe traditional instrument uses coils, and your hands alter the frequency of oscillators. Some versions use light sensors to avoid the problems associated with coils. While the time of flight sensors also use light, they are immune to many false readings caused by stray light.\n\nWhile there is a kit for sale, you can find the schematic and source code on\nGitHub with a BSD-3-Clause license. We had hoped for a video of the device, but we didnt see one.\nOne nice thing about the device is you can easily swap the handedness. That is, you can switch the function of the virtual coils easily if you prefer to use your dominant hand for pitch.\nWe talk about theremins around here more than youd think. You can build a classic one quite easily, and weve seen plenty of more complex designs, too.", "title": "\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u3068\u306f\uff1f\uff1a DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u697d\u5668\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\"Extreme Kits\"\u304c\u3001\u5149\u6ce2\u30c6\u30eb\u30df\u30f3\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7591\u554f\u3092\u63d0\u8d77\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30c6\u30eb\u30df\u30f3\u306f\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3\u30fb\u30c6\u30eb\u30df\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u697d\u5668\u3067\u3001\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u5909\u7a2e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002GitHub\u3067\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u304c\u3001\u52d5\u753b\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u3068\u306f\uff1f\uff1a DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u697d\u5668\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u30c6\u30ec\u30df\u30f3\uff1a\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\uff1aDIY\u30c6\u30ec\u30df\u30f3\u697d\u5668\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\uff1aBSD-3-Clause\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "\u5229\u304d\u624b\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff1a\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u306e\u7279\u5fb4"]}

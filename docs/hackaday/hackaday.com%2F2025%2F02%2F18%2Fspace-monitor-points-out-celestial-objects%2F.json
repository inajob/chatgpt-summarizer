Is Jupiter directly above your desk? Is the ISS currently underneath you?\nIf youve ever found yourself wondering such things, you might want to look into making something like Space Monitor. Designed by [Kevin Assen], this little gadget is able to literally point out the locations of objects in space. Currently its limited to the ISS and Mars, but adding new objects to track is just a matter of loading in the appropriate orbital data.\nIn addition to slewing around its 3D printed indicator, the Space Monitor also features a round LCD that displays the object currently being tracked, as well as the weather. Reading through the list of features and capabilities of the ESP32-powered device, we get the impression that [Kevin] is using it as a sort of development platform for various concepts. Features like remote firmware updates and the ability to point smartphones to the devices configuration page via on-screen QR arent necessarily needed on a personal-use device, but its great practice for when you do eventually send one of your creations out into the scary world beyond your workbench.\nIf youre interested in something a bit more elaborate, check out this impressive multi-level satellite tracker we covered back in 2018.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u793a\u3059\u300c\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u5b87\u5b99\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u306e\u7269\u4f53\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u793a\u3059\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u793a\u3059\u300c\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- ESP32\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u5b87\u5b99\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u5c3e\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- Hubble\u3084ISS\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u628a\u63e1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5de5\u5177", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u8eab\u8fd1\u306b\u611f\u3058\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

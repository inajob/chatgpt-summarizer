Then again, if youre teaching someone how a variable resistor works, that old #2 might be just the thing.\nWhen [HackMakeMod] realized that the graphite in pencil lead is essentially the same thing as the carbon composition material inside most common pots, the idea for a DIY teaching potentiometer was born. The trick was to build something to securely hold the strip while making contact with the ends, as well as providing a way to wipe a third contact across its length. The magic of 3D printing provided the parts for the pot, with a body that holds a thin strip of pencil-smeared paper securely around its inner diameter. A shaft carries the wiper, which is just a small length of stripped hookup wire making contact with the paper strip. A clip holds everything firmly in place. The video below shows the build process and the results of testing, which were actually pretty good.\nOf course, the construction used here isnt meant for anything but demonstration purposes, but in that role, it performs really well. Its good that [HackMakeMod] left the body open to inspection, so students can see how the position of the wiper correlates to resistance. It also makes it easy to slip new resistance materials in and out, perhaps using different lead grades to get different values.\nHats off to a clever build that should be sure to help STEM teachers engage their students. Next up on the lesson plan: a homebrew variable capacitor.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip.", "title": "DIY\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "DIY\u6559\u6750\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u925b\u7b46\u306e\u82af\u3068\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u90e8\u5206\u306b\u30ef\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066\u3001\u5909\u7d20\u62b5\u6297\u3092\u5b9f\u6f14\u3002STEM\u6559\u5e2b\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u751f\u5f92\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u3064\u3051\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u925b\u7b46\u3068\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "STEM\u6559\u80b2\u5411\u3051\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6559\u6750\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u5229\u7528\u306e\u6280\u8853"]}

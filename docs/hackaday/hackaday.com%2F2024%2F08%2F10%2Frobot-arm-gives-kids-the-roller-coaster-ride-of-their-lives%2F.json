But theyre certainly big enough to be tossed around by this giant robot arm roller coaster simulator.\nAs to the question of why [Dave] has a Kuka KR 150 robot in his house, we prefer to leave that unasked and move forward. And apparently, this isnt his first attempt at using the industrial robot as a motion simulator. That attempt revealed a few structural problems with the attachment between the riders chair and the robots wrist. After redesigning the frame with stouter metal and adding a small form-factor gaming PC and a curved monitor in front of the seat, [Dave] was ready to figure out how to make the arm simulate the motions of a roller coaster.\nNow, if you ever thought the world would be a better place if only we had a roller coaster database complete with 4k 60 fps video captured from real coasters, youre in luck. CoasterStats not only exists, but it also includes six-axis accelerometer data from real rides of coasters across Europe. That gave [Dave] the raw data he needed, but getting it translated into robot motions that simulate the feeling of the ride was a bit tricky. [Dave] goes into the physics of it all in the video below, but suffice it to say that the result is pretty cool.\nMore after the break.\n\nBefore anyone gets the urge to call Family Services and report [Dave], know that he seems to have taken great care not to build something thatll turn the kids into jelly. He describes the safety systems in an earlier video, but the basics are laser light curtains to keep the arm within a small safe window, an e-stop switch, and limiting the acceleration to 1 g even when the real coaster would be giving its riders a good beating. Thats probably less than something like this real backyard coaster generates.\n<!--more-->\n"}

Rather than see his kids favourite toy relegated to shed until spring, [John Boss] added electric power, and an extra wheel to make one fun-looking snow trike. Like a boss, you might say.\nPhysically, the trike is a delta configuration: two rear wheels and one front, though as you can see the front wheel has been turned into a ski. Thats not the most stable configuration, but by shifting the foot pegs to the front wheel and keeping the electronics down low, [John] is able to maintain a safe center of gravity. Hes also limiting the throttle so kiddo cant go dangerously fast indeed, the throttle control is in the rear electronics component. The kid just has a big green go button.\nBit-banging the throttle, combined with the weight of the kiddo up front, creates a strong tendency towards wheel-spin, but [John] fixes that with a some cleverly printed TPU paddles zip-tied to the harbor-freight wheels and tires hes hacked into use. Those wheels are fixed to a solid axle thats mounted to flat plate [John] had made up to attach to the bike frame. Its all surprisingly solid, given that [John] is able to demonstrate the safety factor by going for a spin of his own. We would have done the same.\nWe particularly like the use of a tool battery for hot-swappable power. This isnt the first time weve seen a kids toy get the tool battery treatment, but you arent limited to mobile uses. Weve seen the ubiquitous 18V power packs in everything from fume extractors to a portable powerpack that can even charge a Tesla.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306b\u6539\u9020", "body": "\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u96ea\u7528\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3082\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306b\u6539\u9020", "- \u96ea\u9053\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af", "- \u4e2d\u5fc3\u91cd\u5fc3\u3092\u4fdd\u3064\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30ef\u30c3\u30d7\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u5de5\u592b"]}

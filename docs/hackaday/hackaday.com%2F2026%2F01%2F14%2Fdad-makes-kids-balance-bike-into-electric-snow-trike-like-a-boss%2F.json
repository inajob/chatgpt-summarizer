Rather than see his kids favourite toy relegated to shed until spring, [John Boss] added electric power, and an extra wheel to make one fun-looking snow trike. Like a boss, you might say.\nPhysically, the trike is a delta configuration: two rear wheels and one front, though as you can see the front wheel has been turned into a ski. Thats not the most stable configuration, but by shifting the foot pegs to the front wheel and keeping the electronics down low, [John] is able to maintain a safe center of gravity. Hes also limiting the throttle so kiddo cant go dangerously fast indeed, the throttle control is in the rear electronics component. The kid just has a big green go button.\nBit-banging the throttle, combined with the weight of the kiddo up front, creates a strong tendency towards wheel-spin, but [John] fixes that with a some cleverly printed TPU paddles zip-tied to the harbor-freight wheels and tires hes hacked into use. Those wheels are fixed to a solid axle thats mounted to flat plate [John] had made up to attach to the bike frame. Its all surprisingly solid, given that [John] is able to demonstrate the safety factor by going for a spin of his own. We would have done the same.\nWe particularly like the use of a tool battery for hot-swappable power. This isnt the first time weve seen a kids toy get the tool battery treatment, but you arent limited to mobile uses. Weve seen the ubiquitous 18V power packs in everything from fume extractors to a portable powerpack that can even charge a Tesla.\n\n"}

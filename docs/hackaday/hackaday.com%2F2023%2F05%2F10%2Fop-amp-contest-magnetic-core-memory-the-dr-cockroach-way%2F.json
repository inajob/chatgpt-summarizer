Radiation-hard, nonvolatile, and so pretty. Whats there not to love? [Mark Nesselhaus] is no stranger to fun in-your-face electronics builds \u2014 judging from his hackaday.io projects \u2014 and this entry to the Hackaday Op-Amp contest is no outlier. This is a sixteen-bit magnetic core RAM demonstrator built upon glass using copper tape and solder, which always looks great and is actually not all that hard to do yourself provided you grab a new scalpel blade from the pack before starting.\nTransformer-coupled differential front-end amplifier driving an SR latch.\nFor the uninitiated, the crossed X and Y wires each host a hard magnetic toroid which can only be magnetised by a field beyond a certain threshold due to the shape of the B-H curve of ferrite materials. The idea is for a required threshold current, drive the selected X line and Y line each with a current half of this value, so that only the selected core bit sees the full field value, and flips state. This means that only a single bit can be written for each core plane, so to form longer words these layers are stacked, producing some wonderful cubic structures. These magnetic circuits are responsible for putting a human on the moon.\nReading the bit state is basically the opposite. A third sense wire is passed sequentially through each bit in the array. By driving a current the opposite way through the selected core bit, if the core was previously magnetised then the sense wire will read a short pulse that can be amplified and registered. The eagle-eyed will realise that reading is a destructive process, so this needs to be followed up by a write-back process to refresh the bit, although the core state will persist without power, giving the memory nonvolatile behaviour.\n[Mark] utilises a simple discrete transistor differential transformed-coupled front end which senses the tiny current pulse and passes it along to a Set-Reset latch for visualisation. This simple concept could easily be extended to make this a practical memory, but for now, addressing is courtesy of a pair of crocodile clips and a discrete write/read pulse switch. We will watch with interest how far this goes.\nDIY core memory builds are not a regular occurrence around these parts, but we see them from time to time, like this polished 64-bit setup. Core arrays are not the only magnetic memory in town, weve also seen DIY core rope memories as well.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8RAM\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c", "body": "\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u304c16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8RAM\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u786c\u5316\u5f8c\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3067\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u306b\u5f37\u304f\u3001\u975e\u63ee\u767a\u6027\u3067\u3042\u308b\u306a\u3069\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5225\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3088\u308a\u3082\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u8aad\u307f\u66f8\u304d\u64cd\u4f5c\u306f\u307e\u3060\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u898b\u5b88\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8RAM\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306f\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u975e\u63ee\u767a\u6027\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u7d76\u7e01\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u3067SR\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u99c6\u52d5", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u88fd\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30a2RAM", "\u8d85\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u6708\u306b\u4eba\u3092\u9001\u308a\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u3001\u78c1\u6c17\u56de\u8def\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f"]}

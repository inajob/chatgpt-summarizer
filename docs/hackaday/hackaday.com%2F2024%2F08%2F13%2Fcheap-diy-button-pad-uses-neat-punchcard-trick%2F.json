Theyre fun and cool but theyre also something you can build yourself if youre so inclined. [Jason] did just that for his sim racing setup, and he included some nifty old-school tech as well.\nAn ESP32 is at the core of the build, listening to button presses and communicating with the PC. However, the build doesnt actually use regular buttons. Instead, it uses infrared sensors wired up in a matrix. This was an intentional choice, because [Jason] wanted the device to be reconfigurable with different paper card overlays. There are ways to do this with regular buttons too, but it works particularly well with the infrared technique. Plus, each button also gets a Neopixel allowing its color to be changed to suit different button maps.\nWhats really neat is that the button maps\u00a0change instantly when a different overlay card is inserted. [Jason] achieved this with an extra row of infrared sensors to detect punched holes in the bottom of the overlay cards.\nOnce upon a time, even building your own keyboard was an uphill battle. Today, its easier than ever to whip up fun\u00a0and unique interface devices that suit your own exact needs. Thats a good thing! Video after the break.\n\n"}

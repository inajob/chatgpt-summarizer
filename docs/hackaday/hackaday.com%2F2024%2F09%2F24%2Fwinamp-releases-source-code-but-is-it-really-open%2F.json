One of the unlikely software hits from the period was Winamp, the MP3 player of choice in an era when time spent on dodgy file sharing sites or peer to peer sharing would snag you almost any music you wanted. Decades later its interface is still widely copied, but now you can try the original again as its source code has been made available. Its not what wed call open source though, even though they seem to be making an effort to imply as much with phrases such as opening up its source code.\nIf youd like to have a go with it you can snag a copy from this GitHub repository, and youll need a particular version of Visual Studio 2019 to build it. Any celebrations will be muted though by paragraph five of the Winamp Collaborative License, which prohibits distribution of modified versions or forks, and stipulates that only the official maintainers can distribute it. This doesnt sound like open source to us, indeed it seems theyre just looking for community maintenance for free, which probably isnt too surprising from a brand which went all-out to join the NFT bandwagon a couple of years ago.\nSo have a look for nostalgias sake if you want, but wed suggest going for something more community driven if you want to do anything with it.\nHeader: Christiaan Colen, CC BY-SA 2.0."}

[Ian Hamilton] put together a quick concept machine consisting of a Raspberry Pi 400 that uses a VR headset as its monitor, which sure seems like the bones of a new breed of cyberdeck.\nWith passthrough on, one still sees the outside world.\nThe computer-in-a-keyboard nature of the Pi 400 means that little more than a mouse and the VR headset are needed to get a functional computing environment. Well, that and some cables and adapters.\nWhats compelling about this is that the VR headset is much more than just a glorified monitor. In the VR environment, the external video source (in this case, the Raspberry Pi) is displayed in a window just like any other application. Pass-through can also be turned on, so that the headsets external cameras display ones surroundings as background. This means theres no loss of environmental awareness while using the rig.\nVideo over USB-C is technically DisplayPort altmode, and both the video source and the USB-C cable have to support it. In [Ian]s case, the Raspberry Pi 400 outputs HDMI and he uses a Shadowcast 2 capture card to accept HDMI on one end and outputs video over USB-C on the other.\nAs a concept its an interesting one for sure. Perhaps well see decks of this nature in our next cyberdeck contest?"}

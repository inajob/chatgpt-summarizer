If you can believe it, weve already closed out the first challenge of the 2023 Hackaday Prize, and you know what that means  its time to announce the 10 finalists.\nAs a reminder, each of these projects not only takes home $500 USD, but moves on to the next round of judging. During the recently announced 2023 Supercon, well announce the six projects that were selected by our panel of judges to collect their share of $100,000 in prize money plus a residency at Supplyframes DesignLab and eternal hacker glory for the Grand Prize winner.\n\nTeaching the Next Generation\nThe Re-engineering Education challenge asked hackers to come up with ideas that would help others learn new skills. As anyone reading Hackaday knows, learning is more than sitting down in a classroom with a textbook, so the best entries in this category were the ones that were interactive and promoted a hands-on approach.\nBolt Bots can take many forms.\nFor example, several of the finalists focus on robotics. Theres perhaps no better or more engaging way to get young people excited about STEM than having them build their own robots. But it can be a tall order for some schools, which is why projects like the $10 Robot from Neil Lambeth are so exciting. Dropping the cost of the bots control board down to the bare minimum not only means more schools can afford this kind of curriculum, but that students might even able to take their creations home to keep rather than having to leave them in the classroom.\nSimilarly, Sauls Bolt Bots project aims to reduce the upfront cost of building robotic platforms by using 3D printed frame components and off-the-shelf servos. Finally, EL-KiDS from Sekolah Robot Indonesia uses a modular no-code approach to building robots which is perfect for younger students.\nA calculator for a more civilized age.\nThe judges were also impressed with a number of computing projects. While affordable Linux-powered Chromebooks have become a welcome sight in many schools, theyre best used for consuming media and doing classwork  you wont learn much about the nuts and bolts of computing with one.\nFor that, you need something like Lee Harts 1802 MemberChip Card. This pocket-sized computer uses RCAs 1802 microprocessor and 64 KB of memory (split between RAM and ROM) to run BASIC, FORTH, LISP, and a few games. Best of all, students can build it themselves with the help of a Heathkit-style instruction manual.\nWe also saw a number of mobile computing devices entered into the Re-engineering Education challenge, such as the Python Programmable Calculator (PYPRCA) by bobricius and the NEOklacker by Spider Jerusalem. While youll find few students without their own mobile gadgets these days, the same rule applies as with the Chromebooks; theyre great tools, but you dont learn much about what actually makes them tick by using them. Giving students a mobile device they can build, tweak, and rebuild, offers a whole new world of possibilities.\nRe-engineering Education Finalists\n\n\n\n\n\n$10 Robot!\n20\u20ac DIY-Eyetracker for school projects\n1802 MemberChip Card\nBolt Bots  Micro Servo Droids\nHigh Schoolers Build a Radio Receiver\nEL-KiDS\nESPboy  Software development MuliTool\nPython Programmable Calculator\nNEOklacker\nDSP PAW\n\n\n\n\n\nLending a Hand\nThe Re-engineering Education challenge might be over, but the 2023 Hackaday Prize is just getting started. Were currently in the middle of the Assistive Tech challenge, which tasks hackers with developing devices that can help those with disabilities earn back a bit of their independence  a noble goal if there ever was one. Afterwards, weve still got three more challenges to go before this years competition crosses the finish line.\nAs always, we wouldnt be able to put on the Hackaday Prize  now in its tenth year  without the support of our incredible sponsors.

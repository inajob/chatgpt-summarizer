This generally doesnt allow for much design of the clock besides the face, and since [core weaver] was building a clock that plays bird songs, a much more hackable clock driver was needed to interface with the rest of the electronics needed to build this project.\nThe clock hands for this build are driven by a double stepper motor which controls an hour and minute hand coaxially but independently. Originally an H-bridge circuit was designed for driving each of the hands but they draw so little current in this configuration that they could be driven by the microcontroller directly. A DS3231 clock is used for timekeeping connected to an ATMega128a which controls everything else. At the start of each hour the clock plays a corresponding bird song by communicating with an mp3 module, and a remote control can also be used to play the songs on demand.\nBird clocks are not an uncommon thing to find off the shelf, but this one adds a number of customizations that let it fly above those offerings, including customizing the sounds that play on the hour and adding remote control capabilities, a lithium battery charging circuit, and a number of other creature comforts. If youre looking for even more unique bird clock designs this binary bird clock might fit the bill.\n\n", "title": "\u30af\u30aa\u30fc\u30c4\u767a\u632f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067DIY\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30af\u30a9\u30fc\u30c4\u632f\u52d5\u5b50\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ea\u30d3\u30eb\u30c8\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u9ce5\u306e\u9cf4\u304d\u58f0\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u5909\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u306f\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30af\u30aa\u30fc\u30c4\u767a\u632f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067DIY\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3088\u3046", "\u9ce5\u306e\u3055\u3048\u305a\u308a\u304c\u6d41\u308c\u308b\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u304a\u3046", "\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u9ce5\u306e\u3055\u3048\u305a\u308a\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "DS3231\u6642\u8a08\u3068ATMega128a\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u9ce5\u306e\u3055\u3048\u305a\u308a\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u5236\u5fa1", "\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3067\u4ed6\u306e\u9ce5\u6642\u8a08\u3068\u4e00\u7dda\u3092\u753b\u3059\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30fc\u9ce5\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u6210"]}

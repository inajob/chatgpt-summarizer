Tom Nardi dropped by, too.\nDid you miss Supercon? It isnt quite the whole experience, but most of the talks are on our YouTube channel, with more coming in the weeks ahead. Check out the live tab for most of the ones up now. You can even watch the badge hacking celebration. Well be writing up more in the following weeks.\nAl nailed Whats That Sound, as did many others, except Elliot. [Jacx] gets a T-shirt, and you get a chance to play again next week.\nThe hacks this week range from a pair of posts pertaining to poop  multi-color 3D printer poop, that is. We wondered if you could print rainbow filament instead of a purge tower. The Raspberry Pi 5 draws a lot of excess power when in standby. Turns out, thanks to the Internet, the easy fix for that is already in. Other hacks range from EMI test gear to portable antennas with excursions into AI, biomedical sensors, and retrocomputing.\nIn the Cant Miss category, we discussed Maya Poschs post, which could just as easily be titled: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about CAT Cable (But Were Afraid to Ask). Last, but not least, youll hear about Lewin Days round up of exotic gyroscope technology, including some very cool laser pictures.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload for listening or for a very long ringtone.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 243 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2023 Hackaday Superconference\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Jacx] who was one of many who submitted the correct answer: a self-inking date stamp.

But what happens if the same idea is used to create a low voltage instead of a high one? [D. Creative] has a soldering gun project doing just this, making a low voltage at a very high current.\nThe video of the project is below the break, and while electrically its nothing unexpected, were taken by the quality of the build. All the parts come from scrap electronics, the main transformer is three ferrite cores with a piece of copper busbar as the secondary. The circuitry is built dead bug style, and its housed in a gun-style case made by hand from sheet Perspex. It takes 12 volt power from a laptop power supply, and feeds it to the oscillator which is perched up at the back of the device. The transformer fits in the barrel, and a pair of large capacitors fit in the handle. We expect it to get hot, but the duty cycle on these devices in use is probably low enough to keep it from melting.\nWe like anything that uses scrap parts to make something useful, and were particularly taken with the casing of this one. It looks as though the parts come from old switch mode power supplies, something weve been known to rob ourselves.\n\n"}

But [Sylefeb]s version of the Amiga classic  Another World is in a class of its own. It doesnt recreate an Amiga or run an emulator, instead it implements the game itself on a relatively modest Lattice UP5K FPGA.\nThis feat is possible because of the games architecture, it runs on a quite minimalist virtual machine that only needs blitter and rasterising hardware. This makes it a good candidate for the FPGA treatment. [Sylefeb] goes into a deep discussion of the hardware implemented in the FPGA, which makes a solid primer for how some of the 16-bit era games worked. In particular, we needed to read over the section about the rasterisation of polygons more than once. But its worth it.\nThe game can be run on a few dev boards featuring this FPGA, among which were particularly pleased to see the MCH 2023 conference badge. It requires a copy of the original to be owned for the game files, but we suspect if youre this deep in youd probably see that as a small price to pay."}

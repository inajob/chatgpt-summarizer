But [Sylefeb]s version of the Amiga classic  Another World is in a class of its own. It doesnt recreate an Amiga or run an emulator, instead it implements the game itself on a relatively modest Lattice UP5K FPGA.\nThis feat is possible because of the games architecture, it runs on a quite minimalist virtual machine that only needs blitter and rasterising hardware. This makes it a good candidate for the FPGA treatment. [Sylefeb] goes into a deep discussion of the hardware implemented in the FPGA, which makes a solid primer for how some of the 16-bit era games worked. In particular, we needed to read over the section about the rasterisation of polygons more than once. But its worth it.\nThe game can be run on a few dev boards featuring this FPGA, among which were particularly pleased to see the MCH 2023 conference badge. It requires a copy of the original to be owned for the game files, but we suspect if youre this deep in youd probably see that as a small price to pay.", "title": "Lattice UP5K FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Another World\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b", "body": "FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Amiga\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0Another World\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u53ef\u80fd\u3002FPGA\u5185\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3002Dev\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5b9f\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["Lattice UP5K FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Another World\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067Amiga\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u5165\u9580\u66f8", "MCH 2023\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u884c", "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306aAmiga\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306eFPGA\u5b9f\u88c5"]}

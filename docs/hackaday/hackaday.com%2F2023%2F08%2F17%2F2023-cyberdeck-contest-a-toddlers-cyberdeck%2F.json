Pushing buttons, twiddling knobs, and yanking things of course! So [Josh] did what any self-respecting hacker would do and built his little man a custom cyberdeck.\nThe build follows the usual route of some electronics wedged into a pelican-style waterproof case \u2014 which is a good choice for this particular owner \u2014 a repurposed all-in-one LCD video player in the lid and a bunch of switches in the base. The player is apparently a V100-base SBC the likes of which are used in shops for those annoying looping promotional videos, but it doesnt really matter if all its doing is being a focus point.\nThere is no connection from the base to the display but that doesnt matter here. The base is the fun part, with lots of old-school toggle switches and rotary knobs to play with and a load of LEDs to flash in mysterious ways. The guts of this are controlled via an Arduino Mega 2560, with copious amounts of hot glue on display in true hacker style. On the coding side of things, [Josh] used ChatGPT to produce the code from his prompting and Wokwi \u00a0to simulate it before deployment to the hardware.\n \n\n"}

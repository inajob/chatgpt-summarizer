It was literally lightning in a bottle, with a mix of gases like methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water in a closed-loop glass apparatus and a pair of electrodes to provide a spark to simulate lightning lancing across the early prebiotic sky. [Miller] and [Urey] showed that amino acids, the building blocks of protein, could be cooked up under conditions that existed before life began.\nFast forward 70 years, and Miller-Urey is still relevant, perhaps more so as weve extended our reach into space and found places with conditions similar to those on early Earth. This modified version of Miller-Urey is a citizen science effort to update the classic experiment to keep up with those observations, plus perhaps just enjoy the fact that its possible to whip up the chemistry of life from practically nothing, right in your own garage.\n[Markus Bindhammer]s setup is similar to [Miller] and [Urey]s in a lot of ways, but differs mainly by using plasma as the energy input, rather than a simple electrical discharge. [Markus] doesnt expand on his reasoning for using plasma other than the practical consideration of it being hot enough to oxidize nitrogen inside the apparatus, providing the anoxic environment needed. The plasma discharge is controlled by a microcontroller and MOSFETs, to keep the electrodes from melting. Also, rather than methane and ammonia, the raw ingredient here is a formic acid solution, because the spectroscopic signature of formic acid has been detected in space, and because it has interesting chemistry that can potentially lead to the production of amino acids.\nUnfortunately, while the apparatus and experimental procedure are fairly simple, quantifying the results requires some specialized equipment. [Markus] will be sending his samples off for analysis, so we dont yet know what the experiment will show. But we love the setup here, which just goes to show that even the greatest experiments are worth repeating, because you never know what youre going to find.", "title": "\u9ad8\u6821\u3067\u7fd2\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "body": "Miller-Urey\u5b9f\u9a13\u306f70\u5e74\u5f8c\u3082\u6709\u52b9\u3002[Markus Bindhammer]\u306f\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Miller-Urey\u306e\u5909\u5f62\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u691c\u51fa\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5f62\u9178\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u3092\u751f\u7523\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3060\u304c\u3001\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u6821\u3067\u7fd2\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\uff1d\u30e6\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30c1\u30ba\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9", "\u96fb\u6975\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3046", "\u30db\u30eb\u30e0\u9178\u6eb6\u6db2\u3092\u539f\u6750\u6599\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3001\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u751f\u6210\u306b\u7e4b\u304c\u308b\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5fdc", "\u5206\u6790\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5c02\u9580\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u6027\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u671f\u5f85"]}

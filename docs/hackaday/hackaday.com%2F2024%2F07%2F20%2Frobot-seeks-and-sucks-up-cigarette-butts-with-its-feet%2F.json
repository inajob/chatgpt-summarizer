In the meantime, researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology have used the problem as an opportunity to explore what seems to be a novel approach: attaching vacuum pickups to a robots feet, therefore removing the need for separate effectors.\nVERO (Vacuum-cleaner Equipped RObot) is a robotic dog with a vacuum cleaner backpack and four hoses, one going down each leg. A vision system detects a cigarette butt, then ensures the robot plants a foot next to it, sucking it up. The research paper has more details, but the video embedded below gives an excellent overview.\nWhile VERO needs to think carefully about route planning, using the legs as effectors is very efficient. Being a legged robot, VERO can navigate all kinds of real-world environments  including stairs  which is important because cigarette butts know no bounds.\nAlso, using the legs as effectors means there is no need for the robot to stop and wait while a separate device (like an arm with a vacuum pickup) picks up the trash. By simply planting a foot next to a detected cigarette butt, VERO combines locomotion with pickup.\nIts fascinating to see how the Mini Cheetah design has really become mainstream to the point that these robots are available off-the-shelf, and its even cooler to see them put to use. After all, robots tackling trash is a good way to leverage machines that can focus on specific jobs, even if they arent super fast at it.\n\n", "title": "\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cVERO\u300d", "body": "\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u5de5\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8db3\u306b\u6383\u9664\u6a5f\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002VERO\u306f\u6383\u9664\u6a5f\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u3067\u3001\u8db3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u306e\u5438\u3044\u6bbb\u3092\u5438\u3044\u53d6\u308b\u3002VERO\u306f\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u614e\u91cd\u306b\u8003\u3048\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cVERO\u300d", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cVERO\u300d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u55ab\u7159\u30dd\u30a4\u6368\u3066\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cVERO\u300d\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cVERO\u300d\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u6383\u9664\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u55ab\u7159\u30dd\u30a4\u6368\u3066\u554f\u984c\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u8db3\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cVERO\u300d"]}

Partly shrouded in the secrecy of World War II and the Manhattan Project effort, the Mark I, \u201cHarvard\u2019s Robot Super Brain\u201d, was built and donated by IBM, and marked their entry into what we would now call the computer industry.\nNumerous computing luminaries used the Mark I, aside from its designer Howard Aiken. Grace Hopper, Richard Bloch, and even John von Neumann all used the machine. It was an electromechanical computer, using gears, punch tape, relays, and a five horsepower motor to keep it all running in sync. If you want to dig into how it actually worked, the deliciously named patent \u201cCalculator\u201d goes into some detail.\nThe video goes on to tell the story of Aiken\u2019s various computers, the rift between Harvard and IBM, and the transition of computation from mechanical to electronic. If this is computer history that you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s well worth a watch. (And let us know if you also think that they\u2019re using computer-generated speech to narrate it.)\nIf \u201cmodern\u201d computer history is more your speed, check out this documentary about ENIAC.\n\n\nThanks [Stephen Walters] for the tip!"}

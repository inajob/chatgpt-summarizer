In the email that was sent to franchises, McDonalds did say that they are still looking at voice ordering solutions for automated order taking (AOT), but it appears that for now the test was a disappointment. Judging by the many viral videos of customers struggling to place an order through the AOT system, its not hard to see why.\nThis AOT attempt began when in 2019 McDonalds acquired AI company Apprente to create its McD Tech Labs, only to sell it again to IBM who then got contracted to create the technology for McDonalds fast-food joints. When launched in 2021, it was expected that McDonalds drive-through ordering lanes would eventually all be serviced by AOT, with an experience akin to the Alexa and Siri voice assistants that everyone knows and loves (to yell at).\nWith the demise of this test at McDonalds, it would seem that the biggest change is likely to be in the wider automation of preparing fast-food instead, with robots doing the burger flipping and freedom frying rather than a human. That said, would you prefer the McD voice assistant when going through a Drive-Thru\u00ae over a human voice?", "title": "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5931\u6557\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u5e97\u8217\u3067\u5ec3\u6b62\u300d", "body": "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306f\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5ec3\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u3068\u767a\u8868\u3002AOT\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u82e6\u6226\u3059\u308b\u5ba2\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u591a\u6570\u51fa\u56de\u308a\u3001\u5931\u6557\u3002AI\u4f01\u696dApprente\u3092\u8cb7\u53ce\u3057\u3001IBM\u306b\u58f2\u5374\u3002\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5931\u6557\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u5e97\u8217\u3067\u5ec3\u6b62\u300d", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u3001AI\u97f3\u58f0\u6ce8\u6587\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3082\u3000\u7d50\u5c40\u5931\u6557\uff1f", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u3001\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u64a4\u53bb\u3092\u767a\u8868", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u3001\u97f3\u58f0\u6ce8\u6587\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86", "\u30de\u30af\u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u97f3\u58f0\u6ce8\u6587\u3001\u9867\u5ba2\u306e\u82e6\u52b4\u306f\u306a\u305c\uff1f"]}

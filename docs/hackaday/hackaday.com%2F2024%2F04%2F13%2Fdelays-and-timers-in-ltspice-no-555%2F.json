Of course, then all your friends will say Could have done that with a 555! But the 555 isnt magic  it uses a capacitor and a comparator in different configurations to work. Want to understand whats going on inside? [Mano Arrostita] has a video about simulating delay and timer circuits\u00a0in LTSpice.\nThe video isnt specifically about the 555, but it does show how the basic circuits inside a timer chip work. The idea is simple: a capacitor will charge through a resistor with an exponential curve. If you prefer, you can charge with a constant current source and get a nice linear charge.\nYou can watch the voltage as the capacitor charges and when it reaches a certain point, you know a certain amount of time has passed. The discharge works the same way, of course.\nWe like examining circuits for learning with a simulator, either LTSpice or something like Falstad. It is easier than breadboarding and encourages making changes that would be more difficult on a real breadboard. If you want a refresher on LTSpice or current sources, you can kill two birds with one stone.\n\n"}

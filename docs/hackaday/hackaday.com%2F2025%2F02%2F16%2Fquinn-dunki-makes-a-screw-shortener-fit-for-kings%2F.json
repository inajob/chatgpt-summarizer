While she cant teach you how to fix the latter, [Quinn Dunki] has made herself an absolutely deluxe screw shortening jig. And while thats cool and all, the real value here is the journey; watching over [Quinn]s shoulders while shes in the machine shop is always illuminating.\nFirst off, she starts with her old jig, which frankly makes us want one. Its a short piece of aluminum angle stock with threaded holes in it. You thread the screw in as far as you want, and use the edge as a cutting guide. Very nice!\nBut aluminum threads wear out quickly so it works if youre shortening dozens of screws, but gets wonky when you need to cut hundreds. The new jig is made out of steel, and has a slit that clamps the threads in place so she doesnt have to hold the tiny screws with her other hand while sawing.\nThis video is, on the surface, about making an improved tool out of steel. But its the tips along the way that make it worth your watch. For instance deburr early and often is a recurring leitmotif here: it keeps the extra bits that form along any cut from messing up edge finding or vise registration. And yeah, she deburrs after every operation.\nThere are mistakes, and lessons learned along the way. Were not going to spoil it all. But in the end, its a sweet tool that weve never seen before.\nIf you havent read [Quinn]s series on machine tools that she wrote for us, its a treasure trove of machining wisdom.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cd\u30b8\u3092\u77ed\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30b8\u30b0\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cd\u30b8\u306e\u9577\u3055\u8abf\u7bc0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001Quinn\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u92fc\u88fd\u30b8\u30b0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u306b\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u968f\u6240\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cd\u30b8\u3092\u77ed\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30b8\u30b0\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u304b\u3089\u92fc\u3078\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u30cd\u30b8\u77ed\u7e2e\u30b8\u30b0\u306e\u6539\u826f", "- \u6a5f\u68b0\u5de5\u623f\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30cd\u30b8\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u3088\u308a\u826f\u3044\u5de5\u5177\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5931\u6557\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- Quinn Dunki\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\uff1a\u77e5\u6075\u3068\u5275\u610f\u306e\u5b9d\u5eab"]}

Unfortunately, a great deal of them are difficult to use if youre visually impaired. This high-contrast Braille keypad aims to solve those issues with simple design choices.\nThe keypad was developed as a school project by students [Nicholas Nguyen] and [Daniel Wang]. It uses a regular layout, with 1 at the top left and 9 at the bottom right. The keypad itself is 3D printed with large buttons for easier use. Each button has its numeral inlaid on the face which allows it to be easily filled in with paint for high-contrast readability.\nThe real neat feature, though, is that each individual button features its relevant number in Braille. The pips are directly 3D printed into the shape of each button. For those that familiar with the tactile writing system, this makes the keypad much easier to use. It obviates the need to guess at the keypads orientation, and were honestly surprised we dont see this on more devices out in the wild.\nWeve featured a variety of neat Braille hacks over the years, including this neat tactile display.\n\n", "title": "\u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u898b\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "body": "\u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3001\u9ad8\u5bfe\u6bd4\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u3084\u70b9\u5b57\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u6301\u30643D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u70b9\u5b57\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u898b\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9ad8\u5bfe\u6bd4\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3068\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "\u5404\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306b\u76f4\u63a53D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30e6\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a"]}

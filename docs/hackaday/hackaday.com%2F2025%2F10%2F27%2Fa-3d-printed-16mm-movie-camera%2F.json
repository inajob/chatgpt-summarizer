But making one yourself is another matter entirely, as they are surprisingly complex and high-precision devices. This hasnt stopped [Henry Kidman] from giving it a go though, and what makes his camera more remarkable is that its 3D printed.\nThe problem facing a 16mm movie camera designer lies in precisely advancing the film by one frame at the correct rate while filming, something done in the past with a small metal claw that grabs each successive sprocket. His design eschews that for a sprocket driven by a stepper motor from an Arduino. His rotary shutter is driven by another stepper motor, and he has the basis of a good camera.\nThe tests show promise, but he encounters a stability problem, because as it turns out, its difficult to print a 16mm sprocket in plastic without it warping. He solves this by aligning frames in post-processing. After fixing a range of small problems though, he has a camera that delivers a very good picture quality, and that makes us envious.\nSadly, those of us who ply our film-hacking craft in 8mm dont have the luxury of enough space for a sprocket to replace the claw.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c16mm\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f16mm\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u306e\u7d4c\u7def\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c16mm\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- Arduino\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u6620\u753b\u64ae\u5f71", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "- \u6620\u50cf\u54c1\u8cea\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u500b\u4eba\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

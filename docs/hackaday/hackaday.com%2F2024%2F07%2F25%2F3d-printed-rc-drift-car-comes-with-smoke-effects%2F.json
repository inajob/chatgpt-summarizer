If you dont have money for endless tires, fuel, and engine rebuilds, you might like to get involved at the RC scale instead. [Max Imagination] has just the build to get you started.\nThe design uses 3D printing for the majority of the chassis. Rigidity is front of mind, as is creating the right\u00a0 steering and suspension geometry for smooth, controllable drifts. The drivetrain is 3D-printed too, using plastic gears and universal-joint axles combined with off-the-shelf bearings. Steering is controlled via an off-the-shelf servo, with a brushless motor putting power down to all four wheels. While drifting at full scale is best achieved with rear-wheel-drive, its easier to control at the small scale with four driven wheels.\nTrue to the DIY ethos, an Arduino-based RC system is used to drive the steering servo and motor speed controller, with a home-built pistol-grip controller. It also activates a small power supply which runs little humidifier modules, which turn water into a visible vapor for a fun smoke effect. It doesnt really imitate tire smoke, since it disappears nearly the instant the car moves, but its still a neat effect.\nIts a neat build that makes a great starting point for your dive into RC. Meanwhile, if youre more about speed than getting sideways, weve seen a homebrew RC car designed to that end as well.

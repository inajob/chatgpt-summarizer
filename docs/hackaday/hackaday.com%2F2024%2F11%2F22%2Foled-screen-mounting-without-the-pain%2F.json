They may be a rare part here in 2024, but we find ourselves reminded of them by [24Eng]s project. Its a 3D printed housing for one of those common small OLED displays, designed to be mounted on a panel with just a single round hole. Having had exactly this problem in the past trying to create a rectangular hole, we can immediately see the value in this.\nIt solves the problem by encasing the display in a printed shell, and passing a coarsely threaded hollow cylinder behind it for attachment to the panel and routing wires. This is where we are reminded of panel meters, many of which would have a similar sized protrusion on their rear housing their mechanism.\nThe result is a neatly made OLED display mounting, with a hole thats ease itself to create. Perhaps now youll not be afraid to make your own panels.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u53d6\u4ed8\u3051", "body": "OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u53d6\u4ed8\u3051", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aOLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30cf\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308bOLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u98a8\uff1f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8OLED\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u8907\u96d1\u306a\u7a74\u3042\u3051\u306f\u4e0d\u8981\uff01OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u53d6\u4ed8\u3051\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5"]}

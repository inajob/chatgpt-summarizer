They may be a rare part here in 2024, but we find ourselves reminded of them by [24Eng]s project. Its a 3D printed housing for one of those common small OLED displays, designed to be mounted on a panel with just a single round hole. Having had exactly this problem in the past trying to create a rectangular hole, we can immediately see the value in this.\nIt solves the problem by encasing the display in a printed shell, and passing a coarsely threaded hollow cylinder behind it for attachment to the panel and routing wires. This is where we are reminded of panel meters, many of which would have a similar sized protrusion on their rear housing their mechanism.\nThe result is a neatly made OLED display mounting, with a hole thats ease itself to create. Perhaps now youll not be afraid to make your own panels."}

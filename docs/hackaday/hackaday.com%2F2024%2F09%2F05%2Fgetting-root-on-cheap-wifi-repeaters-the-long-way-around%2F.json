Probably not much, but sometimes, just getting root to prove you can is the main goal of a project. If that happens to lead somewhere useful, well, thats just icing on the cake.\nLike many interesting stories, this one starts on AliExpress, where [Easton] spied some low-cost WiFi repeaters, the ones that plug directly into the wall and extend your wireless network another few meters or so. Unable to resist the siren song, a few of these dongles showed up in the mailbox, ripe for the hacking. Spoiler alert: although the attempt on the first device had some success by getting a console session through the UART port and resetting the root password, [Easton] ended up bricking the repeater while trying to install an OpenWRT image.\nThe second attempt, this time on a different but similar device, proved more fruitful. The rudimentary web UI provided no easy path in, although it did a pretty good job enumerating the hardware [Easton] was working with. With the UART route only likely to provide temptation to brick this one too, [Easton] turned to a security advisory about a vulnerability that allows remote code execution through a specially crafted SSID. That means getting root on these dongles is as simple as a curl command  no hardware hacks needed!\nAs for what to do with a bunch of little plug-in Linux boxes with WiFi, well leave that up to your imagination. We like [Easton]s idea of running something like Pi-Hole on them; maybe Home Assistant would be possible, but these are pretty resource-constrained machines. Still, the lessons learned here are valuable, and at this price point, let the games begin.", "title": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLinux\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u6a29\u9650\u7372\u5f97\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d50\u672b", "body": "\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3068\u305f\u30601\u3064\u306eGPIO\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLinux\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u4f55\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3002\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u53d6\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u76ee\u7684\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u30021\u53f0\u3067\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30012\u53f0\u3081\u306b\u306f\u3055\u3089\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5b9f\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3067\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u7121\u99c4\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLinux\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u6a29\u9650\u7372\u5f97\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d50\u672b", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305fWiFi\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1aGPIO\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9", "\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066Linux\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5b9f\u884c", "\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5236\u7d04\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306ePi-Hole\u5b9f\u884c: \u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLinux\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u306eLinux\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027: \u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u306e\u5c0e\u5165"]}

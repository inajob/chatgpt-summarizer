After revealing the bone-chilling winners of this years Halloween contest, the discussion switches over to old-timey automatons, receiving deep space transmissions with a homebrew antenna that would make E.T. proud, and the treasures that can be found while poking around in a modern cars CAN bus.\nTheyll also go over how NASA saved the taxpayers a bunch of money by hacking a remote controlled WWII tank, CNC controlled microscopes, and a cinema-quality camera you can probably build from what youve already got in the parts bin. Finally, theyll detail an ambitious effort to recreate an old computers motherboard with a new feature in KiCad, and muse over all the interesting things that become possible once your test equipment can talk to your computer.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and enjoy listening with a cold turkey sandwich.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 245 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2023 Halloween Hackfest: This Year\u2019s Spooky Winners\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThis weeks sound was an automatic wire stripper!

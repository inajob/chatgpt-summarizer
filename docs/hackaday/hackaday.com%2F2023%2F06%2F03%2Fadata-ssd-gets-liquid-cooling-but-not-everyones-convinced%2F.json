They offered incredibly fast seek times by virtue of dispensing with solid rust for silicon instead. Now, some companies have started pushing the limits to the extent that their drives supposedly need liquid cooling, as reported by The Register.\nThe device in question is the ADATA Project NeonStorm, which pairs a PCIe 5.0 SSD with RGB LEDs, a liquid cooling reservoir and radiator, and a cooling fan. The company is light on details, but its clearly excited about its storage products becoming the latest piece of high-end gamer jewelry.\nNotably though, not everyones jumping on the bandwagon. Speaking to The Register,\u00a0Jon Tanguy from Crucial indicated that while the company has noted modern SSDs running hotter, it doesnt yet see a need for active cooling. In their case, heatsinks have proven enough. He notes that NAND flash used in SSDs actually operates best at 60 to 70 C. However, going beyond 80 C risks damage and most drives will shutdown or throttle access at this point.\nRealistically, you probably dont need to liquid cool your SSDs, even if youve got the latest and greatest models. However, if you want the most tricked out gaming machine on Twitch, theres plenty of products out there that will happily separate you from your money.", "title": "\u300c\u30ea\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30af\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306aSSD\u3063\u3066\uff1f\u300d-\u3000\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306aSSD\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4e00\u7a2e\u3067\u3042\u308bSolid-state drives (SSDs)\u306b\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u4f01\u696d\u304c\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001ADATA\u306eProject NeonStorm\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001RGB LED\u3001\u6db2\u4f53\u51b7\u5374\u8a2d\u5099\u3001\u51b7\u5374\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002SSDs\u306f\u901a\u5e38\u3001\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u304c\u51b7\u5374\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u554f\u984c\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3068\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u6700\u65b0\u304b\u3064\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3001\u901a\u5e38\u306f\u6db2\u4f53\u51b7\u5374\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ea\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30af\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306aSSD\u3063\u3066\uff1f\u300d-\u3000\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306aSSD\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u6700\u5148\u7aef\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\uff1f ADATA Project NeonStorm", "\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306aRGB LED\u3067\u88c5\u98fe\u3055\u308c\u305fPCIE5.0 SSD\u3001ADATAPorject NeonStorm\u304c\u767a\u58f2", "\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306aSSD\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\uff01\u3067\u3082\u30ea\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30af\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\uff1f", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7a76\u6975\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8SSD\uff01\uff1fADATAPorject NeonStorm"]}

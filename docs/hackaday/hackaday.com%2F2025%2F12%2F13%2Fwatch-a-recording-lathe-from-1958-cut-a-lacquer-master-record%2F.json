But [Technostalgism] takes us all the way back to the beginning, giving us a first-hand look at how a lacquer master is cut by a specialized recording lathe.\nAn uncut lacquer master is an aluminum base coated with a flawless layer of lacquer. It smells like fresh, drying paint.\nCutting a lacquer master is the intricate process by which lacquer disks, used as the masters for vinyl records, are created. These glossy black masters  still made by a company in Japan  are precision aluminum discs coated with a special lacquer to create a surface that resembles not-quite-cured nail polish and, reportedly, smells like fresh paint.\nThe cutting process itself remains largely unchanged over the decades, although the whole supporting setup is a bit more modernized than it would have been some seventy years ago. In the video (embedded below), we get a whole tour of the setup and watch a Neumann AM32B Master Stereo Disk Recording Lathe from 1958 cut the single unbroken groove that makes up the side of a record.\nThe actual cutting tool is a stylus whose movement combines the left and right channels and is heated to achieve the smoothest cuts possible. The result is something that impresses the heck out of [Technostalgism] with its cleanliness, clarity, and quality. Less obvious is the work that goes into arranging the whole thing. Every detail, every band between tracks, is the result of careful planning.\nIts very clear that not only is special equipment needed to cut a disk, but doing so effectively is a display of serious craftsmanship, experience, and skill. If youre inclined to agree and are hungry for more details, then be sure to check out this DIY record-cutting lathe.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5207\u524a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "body": "\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5207\u65ad\u306f\u719f\u7df4\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u8981\u3057\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5207\u524a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u65e5\u672c\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6280\u8853", "- \u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30c6\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853", "- DIY\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30c6\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u5207\u524a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u97f3\u8cea\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u8077\u4eba\u306e\u6280"]}

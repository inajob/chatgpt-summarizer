Yours truly had one, and put it through many brutal hours of Amiga-based gameplay. [Drygol] was recently asked if he could alter some of these sticks to be even clickier than stock, and jumped at the change to do some modding.\n[Drygol]s idea was to swap out the original microswitches in the sticks for keyboard switches instead. In particular, the idea was to use the Cherry MX Blues which have a particularly nice click to them. But this wasnt just going to be a straight swap. Instead, since the hardware was retro and preservation was desired, the modification had to be reversible.\nThe result was a drop-in 3D-printed bracket that holds four Cherry switches around the joysticks central bauble. Thus, when the stick is moved, it actuates the keyboard switches with a satisfying click. A 12mm tactile switch was also installed in the base to be activated by the fire button. Then, it was a simple matter of\u00a0 tidying up some of the sticks during reassembly and wiring up the original cables to the new switches.\nIts a neat way to give an old-fashioned digital joystick a new lease on life. This would be a particularly great mod for tired sticks with worn out microswitches, too. Hilarious archaic marketing video after the break. They really are whacko for Wico.\n\n"}

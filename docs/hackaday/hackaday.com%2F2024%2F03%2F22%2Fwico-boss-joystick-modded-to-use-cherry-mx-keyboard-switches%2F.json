Yours truly had one, and put it through many brutal hours of Amiga-based gameplay. [Drygol] was recently asked if he could alter some of these sticks to be even clickier than stock, and jumped at the change to do some modding.\n[Drygol]s idea was to swap out the original microswitches in the sticks for keyboard switches instead. In particular, the idea was to use the Cherry MX Blues which have a particularly nice click to them. But this wasnt just going to be a straight swap. Instead, since the hardware was retro and preservation was desired, the modification had to be reversible.\nThe result was a drop-in 3D-printed bracket that holds four Cherry switches around the joysticks central bauble. Thus, when the stick is moved, it actuates the keyboard switches with a satisfying click. A 12mm tactile switch was also installed in the base to be activated by the fire button. Then, it was a simple matter of\u00a0 tidying up some of the sticks during reassembly and wiring up the original cables to the new switches.\nIts a neat way to give an old-fashioned digital joystick a new lease on life. This would be a particularly great mod for tired sticks with worn out microswitches, too. Hilarious archaic marketing video after the break. They really are whacko for Wico.\n\n", "title": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eWico Boss\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eWico Boss\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306f\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e1\u3064\u3067\u3001Cherry MX Blue\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u3066\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u606f\u5439\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "titles": ["1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eWico Boss\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b", "Cherry MX\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4", "\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wico Boss\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u518d\u751f\uff1aCherry\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4ea4\u63db", "\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u611f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c"]}

They combined simplicity and reliability in a package that was much less expensive than competitors, giving a much wider range of people access to their first printers. Of course there are much better printers on the market today, leaving many of these printers sitting unused. [Irbis3D] had an idea that with so many of these obsolete, inexpensive printers on the secondhand market, he could build something better with their parts.\nThe printer he eventually pieces together takes parts from two donor Ender printers and creates a printer with a CoreXY design instead of the bedslinger (Cartesian) design of the originals. CoreXY has an advantage over other printer topologies in that the print head moves in X and Y directions, allowing for much faster print times at the expense of increased complexity. There are some challenges to the design that [Irbis3D] had to contend with, such as heating problems with the extruder head that needed some modifications, as well as a resonance problem common with many printer designs which can generally be solved by replacing parts one-by-one until satisfactory prints are achieved.\nOf course, not all of the parts for the new printer come from the old Ender printers. The longer belts driving the print head needed to be ordered, as well as a few other miscellaneous bits. But almost everything else is taken from these printers, which can be found fairly cheaply on the secondhand market nowadays. In theory its possible to build this version for much less cost than an equivalent printer as a result. If youre looking for something even more complicated to build, wed recommend this delta printer with a built-in tool changer.\nThanks to [BusterCasey] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "- \u5ec3\u68c4\u3055\u308c\u305fEnder 3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "body": "Ender 3\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001CoreXY\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u65b0\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u6539\u9020\u6a5f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5ec3\u68c4\u3055\u308c\u305fEnder 3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "- CoreXY\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u5171\u9cf4\u554f\u984c\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u51e6\u6cd5\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "- \u4e2d\u53e4\u5e02\u5834\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f"]}

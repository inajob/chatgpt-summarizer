One of these antennae, for the RIME (Radar for Icy Moons Exploration) instrument that uses ice-penetrating radar to get a subsurface look at Jupiters moons, ended up being rather stuck. Fortunately, on May 12th it was reported that ESA engineers managed to shock the sticky pin loose.\nRelease of the jammed antenna coinciding with the actuation of the NEA (NEA 6 Release). The antenna wobbles about before settling in a locked position. (Credit: ESA)\nWe previously covered the discovery of Juices\u00a0 RIME antenna troubles, with one of the retaining pins that hold the antenna in place in its furled position stubbornly refusing to shift the few millimeters that would have allowed for full deployment. Despite the high-tech nature of the Juice spacecraft, the optimal solution to make the pin move was simply to try and shake it loose.\nAttempts were initially made using the spacecrafts thrusters to shake the whole vehicle, as well as by warming it in sunlight. Each of these actions seemed to help a little bit, but the breakthrough came when a non-explosive actuator (NEA) was actuated in the jammed bracket. This almost fully fixed the problem, leading the team in charge to decide to fire another NEA, which finally allowed the pin to fully shift and the antenna to fully deploy and lock into place.\nAssuming no further issues occur during Juices long trip through the Solar System, Juice is expected to arrive at Jupiter after four gravity assists in July of 2031. There it will perform multiple science missions until a planned deorbit on Ganymede by late 2035.", "title": "ESA\u306eJupiter Icy Moons Explorer\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4e2d\u306b\u767a\u751f\u3057\u305f\u554f\u984c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "ESAs Jupiter-bound space probe Juice had difficulty deploying its RIME instrument's antenna, which ended up being stuck.

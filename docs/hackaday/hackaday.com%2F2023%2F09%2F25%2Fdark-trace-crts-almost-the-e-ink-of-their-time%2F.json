But have you seen the Skiatron? Its a CRT that looks like a normal mid-20th-century tube, until its switched on. Then its secret is revealed; instead of the glowing phosphor trace wed expect, the paper-white screen displays a daylight-readable and persistent black trace. Theyre invariably seen in videos of radar installations, with the 360 degree scans projected onto large table-top screens which show the action like a map. Its like e-ink, but from the 1940s. Whats going on?\nThe tenebrescent mineral Hackmanite, before and after UV exposure. Leland Green, CC BY-SA 2.0 and CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe phosphor coating on a traditional CRT screen is replaced by a halide salt, and the property on which the display relies is called tenebrescence, changing colour under the influence of radiation. This seems most associated online with UV treatment of some minerals and gemstones to give them a prettier look, and its use a s a display technology is sadly forgotten.\nA high-school physics understanding of the phenomenon is that energy from the UV light or the electron beam in the case of the tube, places some electrons in the crystal into higher energy levels, at which they absorb some visible light wavelengths. This is reversible through heat, in some substances requiring the application of heat while in others the heat of room temperature being enough. Of course here at Hackaday were hands-on people, so into the EPROM eraser went a small amount of table salt in a makeshift dish made of paper, but sadly not to be rewarded by a colour change.\nOn a real dark-trace CRT the dark trace would be illuminated from behind by a ring light round the glass neck of the tube. An interesting aside is that, unlike phosphor CRTs, they were more suitable for vertical mounting. It seems that small amounts of phosphor could detach themselves from a vertically mounted screen and drop into the electron gun, something that wasnt a problem for tenebrescent coatings.\nThis display tech has shuffled off into the graveyard of obsolescence, were guessing because CRT technology became a lot better over the 1950s, and radar technologies moved towards a computerised future in which the persistence of the display wasnt the only thing keeping the information on the screen. It seems at first sight to be a surprise that tenebrescent coatings have never resurfaced in other displays for their persistence, but perhaps there was always a better alternative whether it was ultra-low-power LCDs or more recently e-ink style devices.\nFor more bleeding-edge 1950s radar displays, weve previously brought you Volscan, a radar with an early form of GUI, which no doubt was one of those which consigned dark-trace CRTs to history."}

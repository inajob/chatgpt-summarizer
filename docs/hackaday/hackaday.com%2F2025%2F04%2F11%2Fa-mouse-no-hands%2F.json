Take [Uri Tuchman]s foot mouse. Its a computer mouse for foot operation, but its not just a functional block. Instead its an ornate inlaid-wood-and-brass affair in the style of a very fancy piece of antique footwear.\nThe innards of an ordinary USB mouse are placed in something best described as a wooden platform heel, upon which is placed a brass sole with a couple of sections at the front to activate the buttons with the users toes. The standout feature is the decoration. With engraving on the brass and inlaid marquetry on the wood, it definitely doesnt look like any computer peripheral weve seen.\nThe build video is below the break, and were treated to all the processes sped up. At the end he uses it in a basic art package and in a piloting game, with varying degrees of succes. Were guessing it would take a lot of practice to gain a level of dexterity with this thing, but we salute him for being the one who tries it.\nThis has to be the fanciest peripheral weve ever seen, but surprisingly its not the first foot mouse weve brought you.\n\n"}

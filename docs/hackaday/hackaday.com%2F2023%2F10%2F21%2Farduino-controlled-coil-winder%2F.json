After building one such rig, [Pisces Printing] wanted to find even further time savings, and thus designed an improved, faster version.\nAt its heart, its a straightforward design, using a linear rail and a leadscrew driven by a stepper motor. Control is via an Arduino Nano, with a few push buttons and a 16 x 2 LCD display for user feedback.\nOften, completing a first build will reveal all manner of limitations and drawbacks of a design. In this case, the original winder was improved upon with faster stepper motors to cut the time it took to wind a coil. A redesigned PCB also specified a better buck converter power supply to avoid overheating issues of the initial design. A three-jaw lathe-style chuck was also 3D printed for the build to allow easy fixing of a coil bobbin.\nDesigning custom tools can be highly satisfying in and of itself, beyond the productivity gains they offer.

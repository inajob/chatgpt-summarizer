As long as the liquid is being printed into contact with a salt solution, the result is a polymer that solidifies upon leaving the syringe.\nWhats also interesting is that the process by which the PNIPAM-based solutions solidify is entirely reversible. Researchers demonstrate printing, breaking down, then re-printing, which is an awfully neat trick. Finally, by mixing different additives in with PNIPAM, one can obtain different properties in the final product. For example, researchers demonstrate making conductive prints by adding carbon nanotubes.\nWhile weve seen the concept of printing with liquids by extruding them into a gel bath or similar approach, we havent seen a process that prides itself on being so reversible before. The research paper with all the details is available here, so check it out for all the details."}

Hes trying it again, and you can check it out in the video below. You can also download the 3D printable files.\nThis isnt a 3D-printed keychain. The screw threads have to mesh with a small space between them, and the design is not trivial. Even if you dont want to build your own, the look inside the engineering behind these devices is interesting, and there is quite a bit of background about how the rotors shapes are optimized.\n\nThe complexity of the rotors is probably what caused the last version to fail. The rotor profile, this time, was handled differently using a Python script to pick up data from an existing profile and output suitable 3D printing data.\nThe finished product sounds loud, and the Printables page notes, [The compressor] is extremely dangerous so act accordingly. He did have a service do the screw printing using a special high-temperature resin. The first prints had backward angles and were a bit smaller than needed. So he finally printed his own screws over many hours. The other parts had to be printed numerous times to get the sizes correct.\nNot the first compressor weve seen. One even used PVC.\n"}

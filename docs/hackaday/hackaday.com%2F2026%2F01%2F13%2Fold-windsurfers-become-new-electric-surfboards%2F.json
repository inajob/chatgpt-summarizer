While its sad to see a once-popular and enjoyable sport loose its mass market appeal, it does present a unique opportunity for others as theres cheap windsurfing gear all over the online classifieds now. [Dane] recently found that some of these old boards are uniquely suited to be modified into electric surfboards.\nThe key design element of certain windsurfers that makes this possible is the centerboard, a fin mounted on the windsurfer extending down into the water that resists the lateral force of the sail, keeping the board moving forward instead of sideways. [Dane] used this strengthened area of the board to mount a submerged electric motor, with all of the control electronics and a battery on the top of the board. The motor controller did need a way to expel excess heat while being in a sealed waterproof enclosure, but with a hole cut in the case and a heat sink installed on top of it, this was a problem quickly solved.\nThe operator control consists of a few buttons which correspond to pre-selected speeds on the motor. Theres no separate control input for steering, though; in order to turn this contraption the operator has to lean the board. With some practice its possible to stand up on this like any other electric surfboard and scoot around [Dane]s local lake. For the extreme budget version of this project be sure to check out [Ben Gravy]s model which involves duct taping two cheap surfboards together instead."}

While its sad to see a once-popular and enjoyable sport loose its mass market appeal, it does present a unique opportunity for others as theres cheap windsurfing gear all over the online classifieds now. [Dane] recently found that some of these old boards are uniquely suited to be modified into electric surfboards.\nThe key design element of certain windsurfers that makes this possible is the centerboard, a fin mounted on the windsurfer extending down into the water that resists the lateral force of the sail, keeping the board moving forward instead of sideways. [Dane] used this strengthened area of the board to mount a submerged electric motor, with all of the control electronics and a battery on the top of the board. The motor controller did need a way to expel excess heat while being in a sealed waterproof enclosure, but with a hole cut in the case and a heat sink installed on top of it, this was a problem quickly solved.\nThe operator control consists of a few buttons which correspond to pre-selected speeds on the motor. Theres no separate control input for steering, though; in order to turn this contraption the operator has to lean the board. With some practice its possible to stand up on this like any other electric surfboard and scoot around [Dane]s local lake. For the extreme budget version of this project be sure to check out [Ben Gravy]s model which involves duct taping two cheap surfboards together instead.", "title": "- \u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u8870\u9000\u3068\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u518d\u751f", "body": "\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u8870\u9000\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u4f8b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u8870\u9000\u3068\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u518d\u751f", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u7406\u7531", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u52d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

[Tito] has grabbed the faithful black plastic box and turned it into a frequency counter as an innovative entry to our 2025 One Hertz Challenge.\nThe code was prepared in assembly using ZASM\u2014a Z80 online assembler. It works in quite a simple manner. The code runs for one second at a time, counting rising edges on the EAR port of the ZX Spectrum. Those edges are added up to determine the frequency in question, and the job is done. [Tito] has tested the code and found its capable of reading frequencies up to 20 KHz. Since it runs on a one second period, its thus eligible for entry by meeting the requirements of the One Hertz Challenge. Code is available on Github for the curious.\nThe ZX Spectrum has a clock speed of 3.5 MHz, meaning its not exactly the tool of choice if youre reading faster signals. Weve seen similar done before. In any case, this project was a great way to exercise assembly coding skills and to bust out some classic Speccy hardware\u2014and thats always a good time. If youve got your own retrocomputer hacks brewing up in the lab, dont hesitate to let us know!\n \n\n\n"}

[Tito] has grabbed the faithful black plastic box and turned it into a frequency counter as an innovative entry to our 2025 One Hertz Challenge.\nThe code was prepared in assembly using ZASM\u2014a Z80 online assembler. It works in quite a simple manner. The code runs for one second at a time, counting rising edges on the EAR port of the ZX Spectrum. Those edges are added up to determine the frequency in question, and the job is done. [Tito] has tested the code and found its capable of reading frequencies up to 20 KHz. Since it runs on a one second period, its thus eligible for entry by meeting the requirements of the One Hertz Challenge. Code is available on Github for the curious.\nThe ZX Spectrum has a clock speed of 3.5 MHz, meaning its not exactly the tool of choice if youre reading faster signals. Weve seen similar done before. In any case, this project was a great way to exercise assembly coding skills and to bust out some classic Speccy hardware\u2014and thats always a good time. If youve got your own retrocomputer hacks brewing up in the lab, dont hesitate to let us know!\n \n\n\n", "title": "- ZX Spectrum\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "ZX Spectrum\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u300220KHz\u307e\u3067\u6e2c\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3082\u8ca2\u732e\u3002", "titles": ["- ZX Spectrum\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- 2025 One Hertz Challenge\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aZX Spectrum\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- ZASM\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- ZX Spectrum\u306720 KHz\u307e\u3067\u306e\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

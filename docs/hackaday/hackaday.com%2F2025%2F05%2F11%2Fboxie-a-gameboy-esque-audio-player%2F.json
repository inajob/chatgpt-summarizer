[Mario] designed this audiobook player, dubbed Boxie, for his 3-year-old son to replace the often-used but flawed Toniebox.\nThe inspiration for Boxie was the Toniebox, a kid-friendly audiobook player. While functional, the Toniebox had drawbacks: it required internet connectivity, limited media selection, and had unreliable controls. Enter Boxie, a custom-built, standalone audiobook player free from web services, designed to address these issues with superior audio quality and toddler-friendly controls.\nBoxies media is stored on microSD cards inserted into a slot on the device. To make this manageable for a toddler, he designed a PCB with a standard microSD card interface, ensuring easy swapping of audiobooks. The enclosure, crafted via 3D printing, is durable and compact, tailored for small hands.\n\n\nThe cartridges slide into the body of the Boxie. This presented a problem, most cartridge media utilize edge connectors. Strictly speaking, his DIY cartridges didnt have those and couldnt use traditional cartridge reader components. First trying pogo pins, he ran into several issues, most notably the inability to hold up to the wear and tear of a 3-year-old. A clever hack to add robustness was achieved when he switched to using a series of battery springs to interface with the cartridge.\nInside the Boxie lives an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which provides the smarts to read all the controls, play audio from the inserted cartridge. The main housing also contains the battery, DAC, amp, and speaker. Mario faced a fair number of new challenges on this project, including designing a battery charging circuit and building his own ESP32-S3 board with support for charging NiMH batteries.\nAll of the 3D designs, PCB files, and source code are available on his GitHub account.

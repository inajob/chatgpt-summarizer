With these systems being installed between 1873 and 1890, they were due major maintenance and upgrades by the time the 1980s and with it their 100th year of operation rolled around. This rebuilding and upgrading process was recorded in a documentary by a local SF television station, which makes for some fascinating viewing.\nSan Francisco cable car making its way through traffic. Early 20th century.\nWhile the cars themselves were fairly straight-forward to restore, and the original grips thatd latch onto the cable didnt need any changes. But there were upgrades to the lubrication used (originally pine tar), and the powerhouse (the barn) was completely gutted and rebuilt.\nAs opposed to a funicular system where the cars are permanently attached to the cable, a cable car system features a constantly moving cable that the cars can grip onto at will, with most of the wear and tear on the grip dies. Despite researchers at San Francisco State University (SFSU) investigating alternatives, the original metal grip dies were left in place, despite their 4-day replacement schedule.\nUltimately, the rails and related guides were all ripped out and replaced with new ones, with the rails thermite-welded in place, and the cars largely rebuilt from scratch. Although new technologies were used where available, the goal was to keep the look as close as possible to what it looked at the dawn of the 20th century. While more expensive than demolishing and scrapping the original buildings and rolling stock, this helped to keep the look that has made it a historical symbol when the upgraded system rolled back into action on June 21, 1984.\nDecades later, this rebuilt cable car system is still running as smoothly as ever, thanks to these efforts. Although SFs cable car system is reportedly mostly used by tourists, the technology has seen somewhat of a resurgence. Amidst a number of funicular systems, a true new cable car system can be found in the form of e.g. the MiniMetro system which fills the automated people mover niche.\n\n\nThanks to [JRD] for the tip.", "title": "- \u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\uff1a\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u624b\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u624b\u52d5\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u30011984\u5e74\u306b\u6539\u4fee\u3055\u308c\u4eca\u3082\u904b\u884c\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\uff1a\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u624b\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- 100\u5e74\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u5efa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5b88\u308a\u629c\u3044\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- \u65b0\u65e7\u6280\u8853\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc", "- \u89b3\u5149\u540d\u6240\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8607\u3063\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u73fe\u5728"]}

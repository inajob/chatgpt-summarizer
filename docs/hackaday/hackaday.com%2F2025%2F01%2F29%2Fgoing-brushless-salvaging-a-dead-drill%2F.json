So when his cordless drill\u2019s motor gave up after some unfortunate exposure to the elements, [Chaz] wasn\u2019t about to bin it. Instead, he embarked on a brave journey to breathe new life into the machine by swapping its dying brushed motor for a sleek brushless upgrade.\nThings got real as [Chaz] dismantled the drill, comparing its guts to a salvaged portable bandsaw motor. What looked like an easy swap soon became a true hackers challenge: incompatible gear systems, dodgy windings, and warped laminations. Not discouraged by that, he dreamed up a hybrid solution: 3D-printing a custom adapter to make the brushless motor fit snugly into the existing housing.\nThe trickiest part was designing a speed control mechanism for the brushless motor\u2014an impressively solved puzzle. After some serious elbow grease and ingenuity, the franken-drill emerged better than ever. Weve seen some brushless hacks before, and this is worth adding to the list. A great tool hack and successful way to save an old beloved drill. Go ahead and check out the video below!\n\n"}

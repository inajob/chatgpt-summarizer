Theyre heavy, not particularly energy dense, have limited charge cycles, and often cant be fully discharged without damage or greatly increased wear. With that in mind, one can imagine that a laptop that uses a battery like this would be not only extremely old but also limited by this technology. Of course, in the modern day we can do a lot to bring these retro machines up to modern standards like adding in some lithium batteries to this HP laptop.\nSimply swapping the batteries in this computer wont get the job done though, as lead-acid and lithium batteries need different circuitry in order to be safe while also getting the maximum amount of energy out. [CYUL] is using a cheap UPS module from AliExpress which comes with two 18650 cells to perform this conversion, although with a high likelihood of counterfeiting in this market, the 18650s were swapped out with two that were known to be from Samsung. The USB module also needs to be modified a bit to change the voltage output to match the needs of the HP-110Plus, and of course a modernized rebuild like this wouldnt be complete without a USB-C port to function as the new power jack.\n[CYUL] notes at the end of the build log that even without every hardware upgrade made to this computer (and ignoring its limited usefulness in the modern world) it has a limited shelf life as the BIOS wont work past 2035. Hopefully with computers like this well start seeing some firmware modifications as well thatll let them work indefinitely into the future. For modern computers well hope to avoid the similar 2038 problem by switching everything over to 64 bit systems and making other software updates as well.", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u925b\u84c4\u96fb\u6c60\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u3067\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u6539\u826f\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u925b\u84c4\u96fb\u6c60\u304b\u3089\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u3078\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u624b\u9806", "- HP-110Plus\u3092USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- BIOS\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u3068\u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064UPS\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

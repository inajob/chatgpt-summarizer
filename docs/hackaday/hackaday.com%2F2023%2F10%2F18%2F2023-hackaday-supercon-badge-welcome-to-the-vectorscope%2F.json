(Or at least fakes it pretty convincingly.) Taking inspiration from the phosphor scopes of yesteryear, the 2023 Vectorscope badge is part analog audio playground, part art project, and all about prototyping. Who doesn\u2019t like the warm glow and lovely green fade of an old Tektronix tube scope? That\u2019s what we\u2019re after.\nConceptually, the badge is two separate devices in one. Most obvious is the vectorscope, which takes in voltages in the 0 V  3 V range and plots them out in X-Y mode in glorious fake-phosphor effect on the lovely round IPS screen. We\u2019ve also tied an audio amplifier to the Y input that plays whatever waveform you\u2019re watching.\nBut you don\u2019t have to bring your own waveforms with you \u2013 the other half of the badge is an arbitrary programmable waveform generator that drives two channels. Off the bat, it\u2019s configurable with the front panel controls, so you\u2019re obviously invited to make Lissajous figures and store them in the program memories.\nCombining the two halves lets you draw in voltages and time, but not until you connect them together, naturally. You see, this isn\u2019t an analog simulation \u2013 it\u2019s the programmable equivalent of the real deal, courtesy of the AK4619 ADC/DAC. Voltages go out on one set of pins and come back in on the other.\nAnd you get to play around with these voltages in through-hole space too, because we\u2019ve included a very generous prototyping board for your analog explorations. Does this instantly suggest a curve tracer to you? Be our guest! Other forms of analog video-mangling? We want to see what you come up with. Make an audio filter and watch it work on the screen in front of your very eyes.\nOf course we\u2019re not leaving you code monkeys out in the cold. MicroPython puts the \u201cprogramming\u201d in the programmable waveform generator. If you\u2019re not content with the four stock waveforms, you\u2019re invited to write your own. And this is where it gets artsy.\nYou can upload your own repetitive waveforms to the onboard direct digital synth routine, but why stop there? We\u2019ve left most of the processing power of the underlying RP2040 untouched, for you to use. And four buttons on the front panel let you store and play back your code, so you have space to stash your demos, and a sweet joystick with a custom keycap gives you control.\n\nInspiration\nWhat can you do with a vectorscope, a joystick, and two times 125 MHz of processing power to drive the beam? Asteroids and Lunar Lander were written with less! On the other end of the complexity spectrum, we\u2019ve included a convenient system tick for writing parametric functions of time. Honestly, floating point math and trigonometric functions are a little slow on the RP2040, but we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be coding curves in no time. We\u2019d really like to see a Fourier series expansion of the Jolly Wrencher, but that might light the CPU on fire.\nHave you seen [Jerrobeam Fenderson]\u2019s exquisite oscilloscope music? That\u2019s the reason that there an audio amplifier on the scope\u2019s Y channel. Or go for [Japhy Riddle]\u2019s comedy version.\nAnd what is a roundup of vector display art without mentioning the vast world of laser shows? We\u2019re sure there has to be a lot of dynamic vector art out there in ILDA format. Anyone know of any good sources?\nOn the hardware side, we\u2019d like to remind you that echoes, reverb, distortion pedals, and all sorts of sound effects are pretty neat when applied to video signals. Or skip the waveform generator altogether and bring your own oscillators! As long as you keep the voltages in the 0 V  3 V range, you can do whatever you want. All those synth DIY circuits rattling around in your skull? Time to make them real.\nWhat else is good to do with a vector display? Sound off in the comments and/or start your research now.\nUnder the Hood\nWe\u2019d been thinking of doing something analog this year, because we\u2019ve been heavily digital with the 2019 FPGA badge and last year\u2019s virtual retrocomputer. [Sebastian Holzapfel]\u2019s Eurorack FPGA frontend showed us how to abuse the AK4619 ADC/DAC chip for DC voltage purposes, and our path was clearer still. Finally, [Schneider] showed us the prototypes for the flow3r badge for this summer\u2019s Chaos Camp in Berlin, and we needed to make a vintage round-screen scope.\nAll of the heavy lifting is done behind the scenes using the RP2040\u2019s programmable IO (PIO) blocks and the DMA subsystem. We\u2019ll give a badge talk where we dive into detail once the dust on the code has settled, but the short version is that these funny little machines are chained together to pull in 120,000 bytes per second from the ADCs, trim them down, convert from uint to int, and store them temporarily in memory.\nMeanwhile, another DMA takes the sample data, formats it up into pixel commands for the LCD screen, and pushes it out using another custom PIO routine. A timer-driven interrupt also fires off occasionally to feed the DAC and make the voltages. And all of this with essentially 0% CPU usage.\nMicroPython is an interesting companion to this kind of system. It provides a live console, a convenient programming language, and all of the niceties you\u2019d expect from a higher-level language. And since most of the grunt work is done on the chip\u2019s hardware, it\u2019s just fine that it\u2019s not quite as fast as a compiled language.\nStart Your Engines\nWhat do you want to do with the badge? If you want to make some nice vector art, and you\u2019re already a bit comfortable with Python, then gather up some cool conceptual ideas, and you\u2019re all set! If you\u2019re tempted to play around on the analog side of life, start breadboarding up your distortion or delay circuits now. The expansion board be waiting for you.\nIf you\u2019ve never worked with MicroPython before, we heartily recommend Thonny for a simple IDE. Just select \u201cPi Pico\u201d in Tools..Options..Interpreter, plug in a USB cable, and you\u2019re off and running. For transferring files and/or using your own editor in conjunction with the MicroPython system, we use mpremote, which gives you a terminal, lets you mount and copy files to the Pico\u2019s filesystem, and basically makes working on the microcontroller super pleasant.\nIf you think you want to design some custom hardware to go along with the badge, the signal generator and scope outputs and inputs are nine pins wide at 0.1\u201d spacing. The extra pins broken out in through-holes? We\u2019ll have wire and soldering irons.\nWith two weeks to go until Supercon, the speakers are all lined up, the catering is ordered, and the tickets are all sold out. (But hop on the waiting list if you\u2019re interested, because someone always cancels.) See you all soon!\nPS: The custom-made joystick caps will probably be black by the time you get them, the code might even be finished, and weve already taken care of those bodge wires.", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306a\u30d9\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u304c2023\u5e74Supercon\u306e\u6ce8\u76ee\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u306a\u308b\uff01", "body": "2023\u5e74\u306eSupercon\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3067\u3059\uff01\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306f\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u306e\u904a\u3073\u5834\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3082\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u4f5c\u6210\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306e\u97f3\u97ff\u52b9\u679c\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306a\u30d9\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u304c2023\u5e74Supercon\u306e\u6ce8\u76ee\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u306a\u308b\uff01", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u5f62\u6210\u5668\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30012023 Vectorscope\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Arduino\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u751f\u6210\u7269\uff01", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3084\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8", "RP2040\u642d\u8f09\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edPython\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8"]}

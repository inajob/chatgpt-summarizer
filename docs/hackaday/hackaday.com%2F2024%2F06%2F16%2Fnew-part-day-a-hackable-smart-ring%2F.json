This time, hes exploring a device that seems like it could have come from the pages of a Cyberpunk RPG manual  a shiny chrome Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) smart ring thats packed with sensors, is reasonably hacker friendly, and is currently selling for as little as $20.\nThe rings structure is simple  the outside is polished anodized metal, with the electronics and battery carefully laid out along the inside surface, complete with a magnetic charging port. It has a BLE-enabled MCU, a heartrate sensor, and an accelerometer. Its not much, but you can do a lot with it, from the usual exercise and sleep tracking, to a tap-sensitive interface for anything you want to control from the palm of your hand. In the videos comments, someone noted how a custom firmware for the ring could be used to detect seizures; a perfect example of how hacking such gadgets can bring someone a brighter future.\nThe ring manufacturers website provides firmware update images, and it turns out, you can upload your own firmware onto it over-the-air through BLE. Theres no signing, no encryption  this is a dream device for your purposes. Even better, the MCU is somewhat well-known. Theres an SDK, for a start, and a datasheet which describes all you would want to know, save for perhaps the tastiest features. Its got 200 K of RAM, 512 K of flash, BLE library already in ROM, this ring gives you a lot to wield for how little space it all takes up. You can even get access to the chips Serial Wire Debug (SWD) pads, though youve got to scrape away some epoxy first.\nAs weve seen in the past, once [Aaron] starts hacking on these sort of devices, their popularity tends to skyrocket. Wed recommend ordering a couple now before sellers get wise and start raising prices. While weve seen hackers build their own smart rings before, its tricky business, and the end results usually have very limited capability. The potential for creating our own firmware for such an affordable and capable device is very exciting  watch this space!\n\n\nWe thank [linalinn] for sharing this with us!"}

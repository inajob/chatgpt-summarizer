Now fast-forward a half-century or more, and affordable, good-quality power transformers are still a problem, and often where modern retro projects go to die. Luckily, [Terry] at D-Lab Electronics has a few suggestions on\u00a0budget-friendly transformers, and even shows off a nice three-tube audio amp using them.\nThe reason transformers were and still are expensive has a lot to do with materials. To build a transformer with enough oomph to run everything takes a lot of iron and copper, the latter of which is notoriously expensive these days. Theres also the problem of market demand; with most modern electronics favoring switched-mode power supplies, theres just not a huge market for these big lunkers anymore, making for a supply and demand equation thats not in the hobbyists favor.\nRather than shelling out $70 or more for something like a Hammond 269EX, [Terry]s suggestion is to modify an isolation transformer, specifically the Triad N-68X. The transformer has a primary designed for either 120 or 230 volts, and a secondary that delivers 115 volts. Turn that around, though, and you can get 230 volts out from the typical North American mains supply  good enough for the plate supply on the little amp shown. That leaves the problem of powering the heaters for the tubes, which is usually the job of a second 6- or 12-volt winding on a power transformer. Luckily, the surplus market has a lot of little 6.3-volt transformers available on the cheap, so that shouldnt be a problem.\nWe have to say that the amp [Terry] put these transformers to work in sounds pretty amazing  not a hint of hum. Good work, we say, but we hope he has a plan in case the vacuum tube shortage gets any worse.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "\u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u6cd5", "body": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30ea\u30c8\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3001\u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002Triad N-68X\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7d76\u7e01\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306e\u4e0d\u8db3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5fc3\u914d\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u898b\u3064\u3051\u65b9", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u4e0d\u8db3\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u5411\u304b\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\u3068\u6539\u9020\u6cd5", "\u7701\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

Since the machine was bought from a US shop and [Michael] is based in Australia it required some modifications to adapt it to the local 220+ VAC mains, followed by adding a PID temperature controller and a small compressor to provide the compressed air rather than from a large shop compressor.\nAlthough [Michael] had discussed using the machine for PLA with the seller to confirm that this would work, a user error meant that the now defective unit had been sitting idly for many years, until recently.\nSince the machine had been gathering dust and rust in the garage, fixing the machine up took a complete teardown to remove corrosion and resolve other issues. After this the original fault was identified, which turned out to be a shorted wire near the heater which had been turned up to a too high temperature, leading to the release of magic smoke and banishment of the machine to the Pit of Despair, AKA the shadowy depths of ones garage.\nIn this first installment, [Michael] cleaned up the machine and restored it to a working state. In the next part injection molding will be attempted again, which should give some idea of the feasibility of turning scraps of PLA and failed 3D prints into smooth injection molded parts, assuming you have the CNC machine or patience to carve out the requisite molds, of course.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3001\u6545\u969c\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u307e\u3059 ", "body": "YouTube\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308bTeaching Tech\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\u304c\u3001\u4ee5\u524d\u306b\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u7528\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001PLA\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5ec3\u6750\u3092\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u9069\u5fdc\u3084PID\u6e29\u5ea6\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u306a\u3069\u306e\u4fee\u6b63\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u653e\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9306\u3084\u6545\u969c\u500b\u6240\u306e\u9664\u53bb\u306a\u3069\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3060\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u306f\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u72b6\u614b\u306b\u5fa9\u65e7\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6b21\u56de\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5ec3\u6750\u3084\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u306a\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u691c\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3001\u6545\u969c\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u307e\u3059 ", "\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u3092\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u53d6\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u518d\u7a3c\u50cd\u3055\u305b\u308b ", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5ec3\u6750\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u6210\u5f62\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f ", "\u4eba\u6c17YouTuber\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u6545\u969c\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u516c\u958b ", "\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u306e\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\uff01\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u53ef\u80fd\u304b\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u308b"]}

In a video you can watch below, he asks the question: Did electronic toys influence your path? Certainly, for us, the answer was yes.\nThe CB base station looked familiar although ours was marked General Electric. Some of us certainly had things similar to the 150-in-one kit and versions of the REMCO broadcast system. There were many versions of crystal radio kits, although a kit for that always seemed a little like cheating.\n\nShortwave radios were fun in those days, too. We miss the days when you could find interesting stations on shortwave. We were also happy to see the P-box kits. If you werent interested in radio, there were also digital logic kits including a computer that was really a giant multi-pole switch that could create logic gates.\nIt made us wonder what toys are launching the next generation of engineers. We are not convinced that video games, Tik Tok, and ChatGPT are going to serve the same purpose these toys did for many of us. What do you think? What were your favorite toys and what do think will serve that purpose for the next generation?\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff01\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177", "body": "\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u9803\u3001[MIKROWAVE1]\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177\u306b\u56f2\u307e\u308c\u3066\u80b2\u3061\u3001\u305d\u308c\u304c\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u9032\u8def\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u305f\u3002\u77ed\u6ce2\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3084\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308a\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3084\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u3092\u80b2\u3066\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306b\u7591\u554f\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff01\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\uff1a\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u306e\u9803\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177", "\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u3092\u80b2\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u73a9\u5177\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076"]}

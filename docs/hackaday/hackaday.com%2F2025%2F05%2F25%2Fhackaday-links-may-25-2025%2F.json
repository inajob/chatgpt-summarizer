Very exciting, we know, and according to a syndicated reading list for Summer 2025, its called The Last Algorithm, and its a tale of a programmer who discovers a dark and dangerous secret about artificial intelligence. If that seems a little out of sync with his usual space-hacking fare such as The Martian and Project Hail Mary, thats because the book doesnt exist, and neither do most of the other books on the list.\nThe list was published in a 64-page supplement that ran in major US newspapers like the Chicago Sun-Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer. The feature listed fifteen must-read books, only five of which exist, and its no surprise that AI is to behind the muck-up. Writer Marco Buscaglia took the blame, saying that he used an LLM to produce the list without checking the results. Nobody else in the editorial chain appears to have reviewed the list either, resulting in the hallucination getting published. Readers are understandably upset about this, but for our part, were just bummed that Andy doesnt have a new book coming out.\n\nIn equally exciting but ultimately fake news, we had more than a few stories pop up in our feed about NASAs recent discovery of urban lights on an exoplanet. AI isnt to blame for this one, though, at least not directly. Ironically, the rumor started with a TikTok video debunking a claim of city lights on a distant planet. Social media did what social media does, though, sharing only the parts that summarized the false claim and turning a debunking into a bunking. This is why we cant have nice things.\nThat wasnt the only story about distant lights, though, with this report of unexplained signals from two nearby stars. This one is far more believable, coming as it does from retired JPL scientist Richard H. Stanton, who has been using a 30 telescope to systematically search for optical SETI signals for the past few years. These searches led to seeing two rapid pulses of light from HD 89389, an F-type star located in the constellation Ursa Major. The star rapidly brightened, dimmed, brightened again, then returned to baseline over a fraction of second; the same pattern repeated itself about 4.4 seconds later.\nIntrigued, he looked back through his observations and found a similar event from a different star, HD 217014 in Pegasus, four years previously. Interestingly, this G-type star is known to have at least one exoplanet. Stanton made the first observation in 2023, and hes spent much of the last two years ruling out things like meteor flashes or birds passing through his field of view. More study is needed to figure out what this means, and while its clearly not aliens, its fun to imagine it could be some kind of technosignature.\nAnd one last space story, this time with the first observation of extra-solar ice. The discovery comes from the James Webb Space Telescope, which caught the telltale signature of ice crystals in a debris ring circling HD 181327, a very young star only 155 light-years away. Water vapor had been detected plenty of times outside our solar system, but not actual ice crystals until now. The ice crystals seem to be coming from collisions between icy bodies in the debris field, an observation that has interesting implications for planetary evolution.\nAnd finally, if like us youre impressed anytime someone busts out a project with a six-layer PCB design, wait till you get a load of this 124-layer beast. The board comes from OKI Circuit Technologies and is intended for high-bandwidth memory for AI accelerators. The dielectric for each layer is only 125-\u03bcm thick, and the board is still only 7.6 mm thick overall. At $4,800 per square meter, its not likely well see our friends at JLC PCB offering these anytime soon, but its still some pretty cool engineering.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u65b0\u8457\u300eThe Last Algorithm\u300f\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\u507d\u60c5\u5831", "body": "\u8457\u8005\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u66f8\u300eThe Last Algorithm\u300f\u306f\u865a\u69cb\u3067\u3001\u8aa4\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u65b0\u8457\u300eThe Last Algorithm\u300f\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\u507d\u60c5\u5831", "- NASA\u306e\u300c\u7570\u661f\u306e\u90fd\u5e02\u306e\u5149\u300d\u767a\u898b\u306f\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u52d8\u9055\u3044\u304b\u3089", "- \u8fd1\u96a3\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4e0d\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u767a\u898b", "- \u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30d6\u5b87\u5b99\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u304c\u521d\u306e\u5916\u60d1\u661f\u306e\u6c37\u3092\u89b3\u6e2c", "- 124\u5c64\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdPCB\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u754c\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\u3092\u63d0\u793a"]}

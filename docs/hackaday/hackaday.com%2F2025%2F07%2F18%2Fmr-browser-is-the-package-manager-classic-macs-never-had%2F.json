Enter [that-ben] with MR Browser, a simple utility to fetch software from Macintosh Repository for computers too old to hit up the website.\nIf youre not familiar with Macintosh Repository, it is what it says on the tin: a repository of vintage Macintosh software, like Macintosh Garden but apparently less accessible to vintage machines.\nMRBrowser sys6 runs nicely on the Macintosh Plus, as you can see.\nThere are two versions available, depending on the age of your machine. For machines running System 6, the appropriately-named MR Browser sys6 will run on any 68000 Mac in only 157 KB of and MacTCP networking. (So the 128K obviously isnt going to cut it, but a Plus from 86 would be fine.)\nThe other version, called MR Browser 68K, ironically wont run on the 68000. It needs a newer processor (68020 or newer, up-to and including PPC) and TCP/IP networking. Anything starting from the Macintosh II or newer should be game; its looking for System 7.x upto the final release of Mac OS 9, 9.2.2.\u00a0 Youll want to give it at least 3 MB of RAM, but can squeak by on 1.6 MB if you arent using pictures in the chat.\nChat? Yes, perhaps uniquely for a software store, theres a chat function. Thats not so weird when you consider that this program is meant to be a stand-alone interface for the Macintosh Repository website, which does, indeed, have a chat feature. It beats an uncaring algorithm for software recommendations, thats for sure. Check it out in action in the demo video below.\nIts nice to see people still making utilities to keep the old machines going, even if coding on them isnt always the easiest.\u00a0 If you want to go online on with vintage hardware (Macintosh or otherwise) anywhere else, youre virtually locked-out unless you use something like FrogFind.\nThanks to [PlanetFox] for the tip. Submit your own, and you may win fabulous prizes. Not from us, of course, but anythings possible!\n\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MR_Browser.mp4\n*", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044Macintosh\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff01MR Browser\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u53e4\u3044Mac\u5411\u3051\u306bMR Browser\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u53d6\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044Macintosh\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff01MR Browser\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aMac\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u521d\u4ee3Mac\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01MR Browser sys6\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 68k\u3068PPC\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eMR Browser\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u958b\u767a\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

No more arrows painted on a barn roof or rotating airway beacons. Now, there are a host of radio navigation aids. GPS, of course, is available. But planes often use VOR to determine a bearing to a known point and DME  distance measuring equipment  to measure the distance to that point. DME operates around 1000 MHz and is little more than a repeater. An airplane sends a pair of pulses, and times how long it takes for the DME to repeat them. [Daniel Est\u00e9vez] has been monitoring these transmissions with a LimeSDR.\nLike most repeaters, the DME transponders listen on one frequency and transmit on another. Those frequencies are 63 MHz apart. This poses a challenge for some types of SDRs which have limits on bandwidth.\n\nThe LimeSDR has two chains of onboard processing, but each is tied to its own ADC. No problem. Just split the antenna and feed the same signal to both ADCs. Problem solved. An LNA makes up for the splitter loss.\nOnce you have the signal, a GNU Radio setup can grab the data to do any final processing and recording. Analysis shows how DME sends 2,700 pulses per second no matter what. Thats because the transponder adjusts its squelch to make this true. When there isnt much going on, the receiver will be squelched below the noise level and be very sensitive. However, if many aircraft are using the system, it will automatically adjust to only repeat the strongest pulses.\nWhile this wasnt trivial, it was much easier using modern SDR tools than it would have been when radios had to be built for specific purposes.\nWant to see inside a real DME receiver? If you simulate the right pulses, you can convert a DME into a clock.", "title": "LimeSDR\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306eDME\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001VOR\u3001DME\u306a\u3069\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u822a\u6cd5\u652f\u63f4\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002Daniel Est\u00e9vez\u306fLimeSDR\u3067DME\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u76e3\u8996\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u53d6\u5f97\u3084\u51e6\u7406\u306fGNU Radio\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u6570\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066DME\u304c\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u9001\u4fe1\u8abf\u6574\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306eDME\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3089\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u3092\u6a21\u5023\u3059\u308c\u3070\u6642\u8a08\u306b\u5909\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["LimeSDR\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306eDME\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "SDR\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u7528VOR\u3068DME\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc", "\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u5909\u9077\uff1aDME\u3068VOR\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "GNU Radio\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u7528\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u51e6\u7406", "\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5fDME\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8997\u304f\uff1a\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u6790\u304b\u3089\u6642\u8a08\u3078"]}

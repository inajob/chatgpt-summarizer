At least we can, and we dont mind admitting it. Take film capacitors  we all know they arent a polarized part like an electrolytic capacitor is, but as [TheDannVal] points out, that doesnt mean both their leads are the same.\nThis might sound counterintuitive, but if you consider for a moment their construction it makes sense. A film capacitor is made from two strips of foil with a strip of plastic film between then, rolled up tightly into a cylinder. One of the pieces of foil that forms one side of the capacitor ends up on the outside of the cylinder, and thus forms the shield for the other. Thus if that side isnt connected to the lower impedance side of whichever circuitry it resides in, it can pick up noise, while the inside strip of foil can not. Its so obvious when demonstrated, but we have to admit to never having considered it before. Some film capacitors have a line marked on them to denote the connection forming the shield, for those that dont he provides a couple of methods for detecting it.\nThe full video is below the break, and maybe you too can now pay attention to your capacitors for lower noise audio circuitry.\n\n"}

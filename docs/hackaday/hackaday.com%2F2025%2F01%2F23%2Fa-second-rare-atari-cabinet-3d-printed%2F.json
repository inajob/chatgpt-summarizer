The flowing exuberance of glitter-finished fibreglass made these machines instantly recognisable. Not so well known though is that there was a second cabinet in a similar vein from Atari. Space Race is most often seen in a conventional wooden cabinet, but there were a limited number of early examples made in an asymetric angular take on the same fibreglass recipe as Computer Space. Theyre super rare, but that hasnt stopped a replica being made by the same team and documented in a pair of videos by [RMC  The Cave].\nJust like the earlier project, a start was made with a 3D model. In this case an owner of a real cabinet was found, who ran off a not-very-good scan with a mobile phone. This was then used as the basis for a much better model, and the various pieces were printed. Using all manner of reel ends gave the assembled cabinet a coat of many colours look, but after a coat of filler, paint, and then glitter lacquer, you would never know. Electronics come courtesy of modern emulation hardware and a Sony CCTV monitor, and the joysticks were made from a mixture of common hardware and 3D prints. Both the videos are below the break, and youll now no doubt also want to see the original project..\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSpace Race\u300d\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u8907\u88fd\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30ec\u30a2\u306a\u300cSpace Race\u300d\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u7684\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6280\u8853", "- \u8272\u3068\u308a\u3069\u308a\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u8853", "- \u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

However, it was a bit odd since the calculator didnt correspond to anything you ever saw on the TV show. It was essentially a very simple calculator with a Star Trek picture and some blinking LEDs. [Computer History Archives Project] has two examples of the rare calculator and shows them off, including the insides, in the video below. Weve also included a vintage commercial for the device a little farther down.\nInside the 5-inch by 9.5-inch cabinet was an unremarkable printed circuit board. The main component was a TI calculator chip, but there were a surprising amount of other components, including three that [Computer History Archives Project] could not identify.\nMEGO was known for making Star Trek toys, including a cassette player that (sorta) looked like a tricorder and communicator walkie-talkies. We wish theyd made the calculator look like some sort of prop from the show, although the beeping noises, we suppose, were supposed to sound like the Star Trek computers.\nHonestly, we want to 3D print a case to replicate this with modern insides that can drive a display to put different Trek clips and sound effects out. Now, that would be something. Maybe [Michael Gardi] can take a look at it when hes got a spare minute. If anything, the calculator looks too advanced to be on the original series. They should have gone VFD. Although Mr. Spock has been seen with a flight slide rule (an E6-B, if we recall). We prefer our props to look like the real ones, thank you.\n\n\n", "title": "1976\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u300cStar Trekulator\u300d", "body": "1976\u5e74\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u306a\u3044\u96fb\u5353\u6642\u4ee3\u3001MEGO\u793e\u304cStar Trek\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u300cStar Trekulator\u300d\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001TV\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u3068\u9055\u3046\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067LED\u304c\u5149\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3002\u53ce\u7d0d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u57fa\u677f\u306f\u4e3b\u306bTI\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u4ed6\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3082\u591a\u6570\u3002", "titles": ["1976\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u300cStar Trekulator\u300d", "MEGO\u793e\u304c\u88fd\u9020\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u756a\u7d44\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306eStar Trekulator", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306aStar Trek\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u306b\u88c5\u98fe\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u3044 - Star Trek\u30c6\u30fc\u30de"]}

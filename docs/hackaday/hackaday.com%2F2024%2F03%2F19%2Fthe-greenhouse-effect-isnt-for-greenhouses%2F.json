Its a structure with glass walls that lets light in and traps heat, all for the benefit of the plants inside. As for how it works, thats elementary! Its all down to the greenhouse effect right?\nAlas, no. So many of us have been mislead. Lets rexamine how we think\u00a0greenhouses work, and then explore whats actually going on.\n\nGreen Me Up Scotty\nIts warmer inside, but its not because of infrared radiation!

It all comes down to misconceptions around the greenhouse effect.\nIn reality, the greenhouse effect is not how greenhouses work at all. Instead, its an analogy we use to help explain the concept of the Earth retaining additional heat from sunlight. In the case of our planet, sunlight comes to Earth, and a great deal of that is shortwave radiation\u2014visible light. Much of that light is absorbed by the Earth and reradiated as longer-wavelength infrared radiation. So-called greenhouse gases in Earths atmosphere capture that infrared radiation rather than letting it float back off into space. The higher the concentration of greenhous gases in the atmosphere, the more heat is trapped, and Earth warms up as a result. The greenhouse effect.\nIt turns out greenhouses work great even if you build them out of materials that are transparent to infrared. The Eden Project in Cornwall is a great example of this, using plastic ETFE cells in its construction.

After all, greenhouses are full of plants that absorb sunlight, right? And some of that is re-radiated as heat. Further supporting the idea is the fact that greenhouses are traditionally made of glass. Glass tends to absorb infrared radiation rather than letting it pass through\u2014much like greenhouse gases in our atmosphere! It all makes sense!\nAnd yet, thats not how greenhouses really work at all. The tell is that you can build a greenhouse out of polyethylene. Unlike glass, polyethylene is quite transparent to the thermal wavelengths of infrared. If greenhouses relied on trapping infrared radiation for warmth, they wouldnt work with the plastic at all. But they do!\nGreenhouses arent really about radiation at all. Instead, theyre all about controlling convection instead.\nPicture a bare patch of ground. As the sun shines on it, it heats up. The warm ground in turn heats up the air above it. The warmer air expands and becomes less dense, and rises up from the ground. Its replaced by cooler air which again saps heat from the ground and through convection, carries away more heat in turn. In some cases, this effect can create a large rising column of warm air called a thermal\u2014which is often enjoyed by gliders, hang gliders, and several species of birds.\nCommercial greenhouses use a variety of methods to strictly control temperature and humidity for the best possible growing results. Goldlocki, CC BY-SA 3.0\nNow picture that same patch of ground, but theres a greenhouse sitting on top of it. The greenhouse and the ground warm up by the heat of the sun. However, this time, the air cant go anywhere. The air trapped in the greenhouse keeps picking up energy from the sun all day, and from the ground at night. Without being able to flow anywhere, all that heat is trapped by the walls of the greenhouse. Thus, the greenhouse becomes warmer, and stays warmer, than the surrounding air. Its all about preventing convection, not blocking radiation.\nAirflow, or the lack of it, is key to how a greenhouse works. In fact, to control temperature in a greenhouse, ventilation is vital. Its also important for regulating humidity and ensuring a supply of fresh air for photosynthesis of the plants inside. To this end, many greenhouses feature roof vents, side vents, and fans to expel excess heat and moisture and to draw in cooler, drier air when necessary.\nOf course transparency still plays a role in the greenhouse. It allows the suns rays to penetrate the building and be absorbed by the plants inside. This is key for photosynthesis, and for raising the internal temperature in the first place.\nIts interesting how the simple choice of name for a widely-understood environmental effect could so skew the common understanding of how greenhouses work. The misconception obviously is further supported by the fact that it\u00a0sounds\u00a0right, but as we all know\u2014in science,\u00a0sounds right is rarely the same as actually right.\nYou can now use this nifty misconception as your go to well actually fact when youre trying to be annoying at a dinner party. Youre welcome!"}

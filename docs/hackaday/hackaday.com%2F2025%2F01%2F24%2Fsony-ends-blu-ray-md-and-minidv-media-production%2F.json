For Sony this seems to have now escalated to where itll be shuttering its recordable optical media storage operations, after more than 18 years of producing recordable Blu-ray discs. As noted by [Toms Hardware] this also includes minidisc (MD) media and MiniDV cassettes.\nWe previously reported on Sony ending the production of recordable Blu-ray media for consumers, which now seems to have expanded to Sonys remaining storage media. It also raises the likelihood that Sonys next game console (likely PlayStation 6) will not feature any optical drive at all as Blu-ray loses importance. While MiniDV likely was only interesting to those of us still lugging one of those MiniDV camcorders around, the loss of MD production may be felt quite strongly in the indie music scene, where MD is experiencing somewhat of a revival alongside cassette tapes and vinyl records.\nAlthough it would appear that physical media is now effectively dead in favor of streaming services, it might be too soon to mark its demise."}

If you werent, hes his very first video on YouTube detailing the design and construction of this piece.\u00a0 Weve embedded it below, and its worth a watch. (Pun intended, as always.)\nThe build was inspired by the delightful amber LED dot-matrix display modules that circle the band of the watch. They go by HCMS2901, but [Sahko] recommends using the HCMS3901 as its both more 3.3V-tolerant and easier to find now. A challenge in mounting so many displays was the voltage on the supply rail dropping below the logic level; presumably the newer version does not have this problem to the same degree. Either way we love the look of these little displays and are pondering projects of our own that might include them.\nHes got quite a few wrapped around his wrist, so at full brightness, all these displays draw one amp. That explains why like the LED watches of the 1970s, the default state of the displays is OFF. Even with a LiPo pouch salvaged from a disposable vape, the runtime would only be half an hour at full brightness without that periodicity. Luckily [Sahko] included buttons on the band of the watch to activate it and control the brightness so it isnt always blasting at full. There are also different modes available, including a really cool waterfall effect you can see in the video.\nThe band is an interesting choice, too: its just a flex PCB. Theres nothing backing it, aside from its own stiffeners, which makes us very curious how well this watch would hold up to daily use. Theres no clasp in the traditional sense, either: the band is closed by a 4-pin connector that doubles as both charge and the USB programmer for the stm32u08 microcontroller that runs the displays. Conveniently for a watch, this version of the stm32 has an RTC, so it keeps time as well. We dig the minimalism of this design; its a great contrast to the maximalism of wrapping your wrist in displays.\nWeve seen very similar displays on an edge-viewed watch, but a tiny amber LED matrix never gets old. If you wrapping your wrist in all those tiny LEDs is too impractically power-hungry, try using Nixie tubes.\nWere always watching for projects wrist mounted clocks or otherwise so if youve got the time, please drop us a tip.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306aLED\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044YouTuber\u306eSahko\u304cLED\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3084\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u304c\u8a70\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306aLED\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "HCMS2901\u3068HCMS3901\uff1aLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u9078\u3073\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "\u72ec\u81ea\u306eLED\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u88fd\u4f5c\uff01\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u660e\u308b\u3055\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "\u30d5\u30ec\u30ad\u30b7\u30d6\u30ebPCB\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u8010\u4e45\u6027", "\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3068\u6642\u9593\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305fSTM32\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u642d\u8f09\u6642\u8a08"]}

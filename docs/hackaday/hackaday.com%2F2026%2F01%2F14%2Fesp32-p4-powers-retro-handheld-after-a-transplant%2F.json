With RISC-V architecture and two cores running 400 MHz, to ears of a certain vintage it sounds more like the heart of a Unix workstation than a traditional MCU. Times a funny thing like that. [DynaMight] was looking for an excuse to play with this powerful new system on a chip, so put together what he calls the GB300-P4: a commercial handheld game console with an Expressif brain transplant.\nOlder ESP32 chips werent quite up to 16-bit emulation, but that hadnt stopped people trying; the RetroGo project by [ducalex] already has an SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive emulation mode, along with all the 8-bit you could ask for. But the higher-tech consoles can run a bit slow in emulation on other ESP32 chips. [DynaMight] wanted to see if the P4 performed better, and to no ones surprise, it did.\nIf the build quality on this handheld looks suspiciously professional, thats because it is: [DynaMight] started with a GB300, a commercial emulator platform. Since the ESP32-P4 is replacing a MIPS chip clocked at 914 MHz in the original  which sounds even more like the heart of a Unix workstation, come to think of it  the machine probably doesnt have better performance than it did from factory unless its code was terribly un-optimized. In this case, performance was not the point. The point was to have a handheld running RetroGo on this specific chip, which the project has evidently accomplished with flying colours. If youve got a GB300 youd rather put an Expressif Inside sticker on, the project is on github. Otherwise you can check out the demo video below. (DOOM starts at 1:29, because of course it runs DOOM.)\nThe last P4 project we featured was a Quadra emulator; we expect to see a lot of projects with this chip in the new year, and theyre not all going to be retrocomputer-related, were sure. If youre cooking up something using the new ESP32, or know someone who is, you know what to do.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32-P4\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u300cGB300-P4\u300d", "body": "ESP32-P4\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fGB300-P4\u306f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u643a\u5e2f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3067\u3001\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3082\u5feb\u9069\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306fGitHub\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32-P4\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u300cGB300-P4\u300d", "- \u9ad8\u6027\u80fdRISC-V\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u306eESP32-P4\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- RetroGo\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb", "- GB300\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u65b0\u578bESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u5c55\u671b"]}

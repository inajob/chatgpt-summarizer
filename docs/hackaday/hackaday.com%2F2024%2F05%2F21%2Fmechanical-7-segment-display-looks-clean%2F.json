He could have gone with a simple OLED, LCD, or LED display, but he wanted something more tactile and interesting. So he built a mechanical 7-segment display instead!\nCurrently, [Jens]s channel is in the four-digit subscriber range, so he planned to build a four-digit display. He started by searching for existing projects in this space, and came across the designs of [shiura] on Thingiverse. [shiura] had a 3D printed cam-driven 7-segment digit that runs on a single servo motor. Once armed with four of the digits, he hooked them up to a Pi Pico W to drive them all with four servo outputs. The Pico W is responsible for querying the channel subscriber count online, and updating the display in turn.\nIts a neat build, and [Jens] learned some things along the way\u2014like how Super Lube seemed to ruin filament for him. Ultimately, the build came good, and it looks great. Weve seen some other mechanical 7-segment builds before, too!\n\n"}

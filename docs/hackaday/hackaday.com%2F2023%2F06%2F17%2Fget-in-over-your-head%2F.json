But let\u2019s be honest, how often does that really happen relative to how many projects end up looking easy at first, and then end up teaching you a lot along the way, often the hard way? If you\u2019re like me, the latter happens more than the former, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly clever.\nInstead, it\u2019s just the nature of learning. In the beginning, you don\u2019t know something, so you don\u2019t realize how difficult it is, hence the first classic line. And of course it\u2019s going to be hard, because learning is always hard. If you knew it already, it would be easier, but it wouldn\u2019t be learning!\nWhether you get through or not depends on your own stubbornness and of course the nature of the hurdles. But whether you learn or not depends entirely on you not knowing what you\u2019re doing in the first place.\nPay good attention to the second line in the post-hack couplet, and heed its advice. Starting off on something that you don\u2019t already know how to do provides you with a fearlessness, and the courage to try something that you might not have otherwise dared. It\u2019s good to get in over your head sometimes. That\u2019s where you learn, and those are the audacious projects that end up being the most successful.\nOr they end up as horrendous failures, but we\u2019re crossing our fingers for you. Be brave! And if you can\u2019t be brave, be incompletely informed.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Its a number on the camp network, but pleasingly retro. How about doing the same thing at home? Easy enough if you still have a wired landline, but those are now fast becoming a rarity. Help is at hand though courtesy of [Remy], whos written about his experiences using a 1960s Dutch phone as a SIP device.\nThe T65 was the standard Dutch home phone of the 1960s and 1970s, and its curvy grey plastic shape is still not difficult to find in that country.\u00a0 The guide covers using various different VoIP boxes between such an old machine and the Internet, but theres more of interest to be found in it. In particular the use of an inline pulse-to-tone converter, either the wonderfully-named DialGizmo, or perhaps closer to our world, a PIC-based kit.\nSo if you can lay your hands on a VoIP box its completely possible to use an aged phone here in 2024. Remember though, a SIP account isnt the only way to do it.\nJ. de Kat Angelino, CC BY 3.0."}

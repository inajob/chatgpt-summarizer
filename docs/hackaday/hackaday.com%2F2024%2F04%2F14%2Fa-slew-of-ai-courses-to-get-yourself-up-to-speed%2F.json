Some want to teach you to use their tools, some want you to pay for training, and others will use free training to entice you to buy further training. Since AI is the new hot buzzword, there are plenty of free classes from reputable sources. The nice thing about a free class is that if you find it isnt doing it for you, theres no penalty to just quit.\nWe noticed NVIDIA  one of the companies that has most profited from the AI boom  has some courses (not all free, though). Generative AI Explained, and Augment your LLM Using Retrieval Augmented Generation caught our eye. Theres also Building a Brain in 10 Minutes, and Introduction to Physics-informed Machine Learning with Modulus. These are all quite short, though.\n\nSurprisingly, Google hasnt been as successful with AI, but it does have some longer and possibly more technical topics in its Google Cloud Skills Boost program. There are actually several paths with AI content, such as Generative AI for Developers. If you prefer Amazon, they have a training center with many free courses, including those on AI topics like Foundations of Prompt Engineering. Of course, you can expect these offerings will center on what a great idea the Google systems or the Amazon systems are. Cant blame them for that.\nThey are all, of course, playing catchup to OpenAI. If you prefer to see what classes they offer, you can check out their partner DeepLearning.ai. Many other vendors have training here, also.\nIf you want something more rigorous, edX has a plethora of AI classes ranging from Harvards CS50 introduction class that uses Python (see the almost 12-hour video below) to offerings from IBM, Google, and others. These are typically free, but you have to pay if you want grading and a certificate or college credit. Microsoft also offers a comprehensive 12-week study program.\nNaturally, there are more. The good news if you have choices. The bad news is that it is probably easy to make the wrong choice. Do you have any youve taken that youd recommend or not recommend? Leave us a comment!\nWe are always amazed at how much you can learn online if you are structured and disciplined about it. There is no shortage of materials from very reputable schools available.\n"}

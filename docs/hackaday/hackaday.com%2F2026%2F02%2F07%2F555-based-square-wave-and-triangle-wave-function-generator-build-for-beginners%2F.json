[Andrew] shows us how to build a square-wave generator on a breadboard using a 555 timer, explaining how its internal flip-flop is controlled by added resistance and capacitance to become a relaxation oscillator. He shows how to couple a potentiometer to vary the frequency.\nHe then adds an integrator built from a TL082 dual op amp to convert the circuit to a triangle-wave generator, using its second op amp to build a binary inverter. He notes that a binary inverter is usually implemented with a comparator, but he uses the op amp because it was spare and could be put to good use. Again, potentiometers are added for frequency control, in this case a 1 M\u03a9 pot for coarse control and a 10 k\u03a9 pot for fine control. He ends with a challenge to the viewer: how can this circuit be modified to be a sine-wave generator? Sound off in the comments if you have some ideas!\nIf youre interested to know more about function generators check out A Function Generator From The Past and Budget Brilliance: DHO800 Function Generator.\n\n", "title": "- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6ce2\u5f62\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- OP\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u4e09\u89d2\u6ce2\u751f\u6210\u5668\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u8abf\u6574\u7528\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bOP\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u5229\u70b9", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u5668\u3078\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff01\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u306f\uff1f"]}

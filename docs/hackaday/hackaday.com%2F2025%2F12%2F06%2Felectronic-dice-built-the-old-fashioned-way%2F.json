You could even choose an ESP32 and have it log your rolls to the cloud. Or, you could follow the lead of [Axiometa] and do it the old-school way.\n\nThe build is based around the famous 555 timer IC. Its paired with a 4017 decade counter IC, which advances every time it receives a clock signal from the 555. With the aid of some simple transistor logic, this lights the corresponding LEDs for the numbers 1 to 6, which are laid out like the face of a typical six-sided die. For an added bit of fun, a tilt sensor is used to trigger the 555 and thus the roll of the dice. A little extra tweak to the circuit ensures the 555 keeps counting just a little while after you stop shaking. This makes the action feel like an actual dice roll.\nSchematics are available for the curious. Wed love to see this expanded to emulate a range of other dice\u2014like a D20 version that could blink away on the DD table. Weve covered some very exciting technology in that area as well.\n", "title": "- 555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fcIC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u50be\u659c\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u8ee2\u304c\u3057\u611f\u3092\u6f14\u51fa\u3002", "titles": ["- 555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed", "- \u50be\u304d\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u4f53\u9a13", "- 4017\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcIC\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- D20\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u62e1\u5f35\u3067\u304d\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

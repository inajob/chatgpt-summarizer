You could pay $80/month for a landline, use a VOIP or Bluetooth solution instead, or do something a million times cooler and turn it into a jukebox.\nNow when the receiver is lifted, [Turi] hears music instead of a dial tone or a voice on the other end. But playback isnt limited to the handset  theres a headphone jack around back.\nTo listen to a track, he can either dial one in directly, or call up a random track using one of the smaller buttons below. A handy directory organizes the tunes by the hundreds, putting childrens tracks between 1-99 and the intriguing category hits between 900-999.\nThe phones new guts are commanded by a Raspberry Pi Pico, which is a great choice for handling the key matrix plus the rest of the buttons. As you may have guessed, theres an DF Player Mini mp3 player that reads the tracks from an SD card. Everything is powered by a rechargeable 18650 battery.\nJukephone is open source, and youll find more pictures on [Turi]s blog post. Be sure to check out the very brief build and demo video after the break.\n\n\n"}

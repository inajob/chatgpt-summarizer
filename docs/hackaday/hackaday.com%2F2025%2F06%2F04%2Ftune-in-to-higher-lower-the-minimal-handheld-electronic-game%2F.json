Its an audio-driven game in which the unit plays two tones and asks the player to choose whether the second tone was higher in pitch, or lower. The game relies on 3D printed components and minimal electronics, limiting player input to two buttons and output to whatever a speaker stuck to an output pin from an ATtiny85 can generate.\nFastener-free enclosure means fewer parts, and on the inside are pots for volume and difficulty. We love the thoughtful little tabs that hold the rocker switch in place during assembly.\nGameplay may be straightforward, but working with so little raises a number of design challenges. How does one best communicate game state (and things like scoring) with audio tones only? Whats the optimal way to generate a random seed when the best source of meaningful, zero-extra-components entropy (timing of player input) happens after the game has already started? Whats the most efficient way to turn a clear glue stick into a bunch of identical little light pipes? [Tommy] goes into great detail for each of these, and more.\nIn addition to the hardware and enclosure design, [Tommy] has tried new things on the software end of things. He found that using tools intended to develop for the Arduboy DIY handheld console along with a hardware emulator made for a very tight feedback loop during development. Being able to work on the software side without actually needing the hardware and chip programmer at hand was also flexible and convenient.\nWeve seen [Tommy]s work before about his synth kits, and as usual his observations and shared insights about bringing an idea from concept to kit-worthy product are absolutely worth a read.\nYou can find all the design files on the GitHub repository, but Higher Lower is also available as a reasonably-priced kit with great documentation suitable for anyone with an interest. Watch it in action in the video below.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHigher Lower\u300d\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30c8\u30df\u30fc\u304c\u624b\u639b\u3051\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHigher Lower\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u8ff0\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u4e21\u9762\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u5149\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHigher Lower\u300d\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u97f3\u3060\u3051\u3067\u904a\u3076\uff01\u7c21\u6613\u96fb\u5b50\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- GitHub\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\uff01\u300cHigher Lower\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u60c5\u5831"]}

This has more to do with some of the popular ones dating from the earliest years of the transistor age than it does to germanium being inherently a low frequency semiconductor, but its fair to say you wont be using an OC71 in a high frequency RF application. Its clear that [Ken Yap]s project is taking no chances though, because hes using a vintage germanium transistor at a very low frequency  1 Hz, to be exact.\nThe circuit is a simple enough phase shift oscillator that flashes a white LED, in which a two transistor amplifier feeds back on itself through an RC phase shift network. The germanium part is a CV7001, while the other transistor is more modern but still pretty old these days silicon part, a BC109. The phase shift network has a higher value resistor than you might expect at 1.8 MOhms, because of the low frequency of operation. Power meanwhile comes from a pair of AA cells.\nWe like this project not least for its use of very period passive components and stripboard to accompany the vintage semiconductor parts. Perhaps it wont met atomic standards for timing, but thats hardly the point.\nThis project is an entry in the 2025 One Hertz Challenge. Why not enter your own second-accurate project?\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u578b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u30ac\u30fc\u30df\u30a6\u30e0\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f1Hz\u306e\u56de\u8def\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002LED\u70b9\u706f\u7528\u306e\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u4f4d\u76f8\u30b7\u30d5\u30c8\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u578b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- 1 Hz\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0LED\uff1a\u53e4\u5178\u56de\u8def\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "- \u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u56de\u8def\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 2025\u5e74\u306e\u30ef\u30f3\u30d8\u30eb\u30c4\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- OC71\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304fCV7001\u3001\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

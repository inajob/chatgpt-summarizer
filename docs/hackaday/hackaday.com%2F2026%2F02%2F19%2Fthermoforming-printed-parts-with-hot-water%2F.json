Correspondingly, after [Zion Brock]s recent video on his journey into thermoforming PLA with a mold and a heat gun, he got many comments suggesting that he should use hot water instead.\n\nWe covered his previous video as well, in which he goes through the design steps of making these grilles for a retro-styled, 3D printed radio. The thermoforming method enables him to shape the curvy grille with a heat gun and two-piece mold in a matter of minutes, rather than spending hours more time printing and removing many supports.\nTheoretically using hot water instead of hot air would provide a more equal application of heat, but putting your hands into 70\u00b0C water does require some more precautions. Theres also the issue that PLA is very hygroscopic, so the part requires drying afterwards to prevent accelerated hydrolysis. Due to the more even heating, the edge of the PLA that clamped into the mold also softened significantly, causing it to pop out of the mold and requiring a small design modification to prevent this.\nBasically, aqua-thermoforming like this has many advantages, as its slower and more consistent, but its less straightforward to use than hot air. This makes both a useful tool when youre looking at doing thermoforming.\n\n"}

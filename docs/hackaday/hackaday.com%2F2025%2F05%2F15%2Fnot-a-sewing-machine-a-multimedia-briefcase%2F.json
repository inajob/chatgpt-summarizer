[Techmoan] has an unusual device from Singer that is decidedly not a sewing machine. It is a 1970s-era multimedia briefcase called the Audio Study Mate. This odd beast, as you can see in the video below, was a cassette player that also included a 35mm filmstrip viewer. Multimedia 1970s-style!\nThe film strip viewer is a bright light and a glass screen with some optics. You have to focus the image, and then a button moves the film one frame. However, thats for manual mode. However, the tape could encode a signal to automatically advance the frame. That didnt work right away.\n\nLuckily, that required a teardown of the unit to investigate. Inside was a lot of vintage tech, and at some point, the auto advance started working somewhat. It never fully worked, but for a decades-old electromechanical device, it did pretty well.\nWe do, sometimes, miss what you could pull off with 35mm film.\n"}

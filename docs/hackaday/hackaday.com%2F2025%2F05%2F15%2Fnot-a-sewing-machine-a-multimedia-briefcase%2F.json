[Techmoan] has an unusual device from Singer that is decidedly not a sewing machine. It is a 1970s-era multimedia briefcase called the Audio Study Mate. This odd beast, as you can see in the video below, was a cassette player that also included a 35mm filmstrip viewer. Multimedia 1970s-style!\nThe film strip viewer is a bright light and a glass screen with some optics. You have to focus the image, and then a button moves the film one frame. However, thats for manual mode. However, the tape could encode a signal to automatically advance the frame. That didnt work right away.\n\nLuckily, that required a teardown of the unit to investigate. Inside was a lot of vintage tech, and at some point, the auto advance started working somewhat. It never fully worked, but for a decades-old electromechanical device, it did pretty well.\nWe do, sometimes, miss what you could pull off with 35mm film.\n", "title": "- \u30bb\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u88fd\u54c1\uff1a1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u88fd\u54c1\u300cAudio Study Mate\u300d\u306f\u3001\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3068\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bb\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u88fd\u54c1\uff1a1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3068\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b9\u30bf\u30c7\u30a3\u30e1\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "- \u6620\u50cf\u3068\u97f3\u58f0\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- 35mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f53\u9a13"]}

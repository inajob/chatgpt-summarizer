Sometimes these have been very good, and other times theyve missed the mark in some way. Latest to find its way to us is the CL-32 from [Moosepr], its a handheld computer with an ESP32 as brains, an electronic paper display, and a QWERTY keyboard in its smart printed case.\nThe hardware is relatively standard, save for the keyboard which is a dome-switch design in which the membrane carrying the domes is hand-made. We like this, and dont think weve seen anyone else doing that. Expansion is taken care of by a novel socket arrangement in which boards nestle in a recess in the surface. Some experimentation was required as always to drive the display, but the result is a functional computer.\nSadly theres little detail in terms of what the software will be, and no hardware files as yet. But what we can see is promising enough to make this one to watch, so well look forward to what they come up with. If an ESP32 OS is a problem, theres always badge.team, who have been continuously improving theirs since 2017."}

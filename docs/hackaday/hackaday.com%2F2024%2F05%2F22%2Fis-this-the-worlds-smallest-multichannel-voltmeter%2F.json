Theyre cheap and useful, but theyre single-channel, and difficult to incorporate into a breadboard project. If youve ever been vexed by these limitations then [Alun Morris] has just the project for you, in the worlds smallest auto-ranging multichannel voltmeter. Its a meter on a tiny PCB with a little OLED display, and as its name suggests, it can keep an eye on several voltages for you.\nAt its heart is an ATtiny1614 microcontroller on a custom PCB, but for us the part we most like lies not in that but in the prototype version made on a piece of protoboard. Theres considerable soldering skill in bending surface mount components to your will on this material, and though these arent quite the smallest parts its still something that must have required some work under the magnifier.\nAll of the code and hardware details can be found in the GitHub repository, and for your viewing pleasure theres a video showing it in action which weve placed below.\n\n"}

You may or may not like that, but thats part of the deal when you buy these things. But with some smarts of your own, you might be able to make that widget talk to you rather than about you.\nSuch an opportunity presented itself to [Benjamen Lim] when a bunch of brand X smartwatches came his way. Without any documentation to guide him, [Benjamen] started with an inspection, which revealed a screen of debug info that included a mysterious IP address and port. Tearing one of the watches apart  a significant advantage to having multiple units to work with  revealed little other than an nRF52832 microcontroller along with WiFi and cellular chips. But the luckiest find was JTAG pins connected to pads on the watch face that mate with its charging cradle. That meant talking to the chip was only a spliced USB cable away.\nOnce he could connect to the watch, [Benjamen] was able to dump the firmware and fire up Ghidra. He decided to focus on the IP address the watch seemed fixated on, reasoning that it might be the address of an update server, and that patching the firmware with a different address could be handy. He couldnt find the IP as a string in the firmware, but he did manage to find a sprintf-like format string for IP addresses, which led him to a likely memory location. Sure enough, the IP and port were right there, so he wrote a script to change the address to a server he had the keys for and flashed the watch.\nSo the score stands at [Benjamen] 1, smartwatch 0. Its not clear what the goal of all this was, but wed love to see if he comes up with something cool for these widgets. Even if theres nothing else, it was a cool lesson in reverse engineering."}

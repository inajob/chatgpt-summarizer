It\u2019s basically a treasure hunt, but the treasures are all shoebox-sized NFC readers that are \u201ceasily\u201d findable on a map. Players all have a smart card and run around from box to box, collecting points that depend on how far apart the boxes are from each other. Walk, skate, or bike 1 km between check-ins, and ten points show up on the e-paper screen.\nIt\u2019s been going on for a few weeks now, and it\u2019s not uncommon to see a line of two or three kids at any given box, all with the purple lanyards and smart cards around their necks. So far, the highest-rated plausible single efforts have 450 km (280 miles) under their belt. My son\u2019s grade-school average is 45 km (28 miles) over three weeks. The goal is getting kids out on the early summer afternoons, and that seems to be working!\nOf course I had to reverse engineer the infrastructure, so here\u2019s what I started with. Each box knows your point standing as soon as you tap the card, with a small delay. Scores appear online about every four hours. And the boxes are all ~1 km from each other or less.\nMy first thought was some kind of mesh network \u2013 that would be by far the coolest solution. Each box could simply report your card number to a central database, and the rest is a simple matter of software. LoRa radios rounded out my fantasy design.\nBut the length of time between getting the points and their appearance online suggests otherwise. And, a little bit of playing around with my cellphone\u2019s NFC reader gives up the juice \u2013 they are MiFare Classic cards with data storage. So I got my own card, ran around town, and diffed the results. I haven\u2019t cracked the location/time-stamping yet, but I know exactly where my total points are stored.\nI\u2019m going to keep observing until I\u2019ve got it figured out completely, but I\u2019m so tempted to tweak the points and see what happens. Are some of the digits in what I think are a timestamp in reality a checksum? Will I get disqualified? Or worse, what if I make a mistake and get myself publicly into first place? OK, better to sit this one out on the sidelines \u2013 I really don\u2019t want to be the jerk who crashes a fantastic kid\u2019s game. Sometimes youve gotta know when not to hack.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

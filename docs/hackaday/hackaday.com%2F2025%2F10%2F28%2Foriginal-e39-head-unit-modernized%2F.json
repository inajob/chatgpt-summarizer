If you wanted a new Pioneer or Kenwood stereo it was usually a simple matter to slide the factory radio out and put your choice of aftermarket head unit in its place. [Stefan] has an E39 BMW from this era and wanted to upgrade the factory radio but use the original hardware instead of replacing it.\nThis isnt just a simple stereo upgrade either. [Stefan] has gone all-out for this build which he started in 2020. Beginning with a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Linux application to handle control input from the vehicles various knobs and buttons he moved on to a map application and an on-screen keyboard. From there he implemented VGA to send video to the OEM screen, and now has a fully functional system based on a Raspberry Pi. It does everything the original unit can do including playing music and showing the feed from the backup camera, plus adds plenty of new, modern features like Bluetooth.\nFor a certain classic car enthusiast, this build hits a sweet spot of modernizing a true classic like the E39 without removing or permanently modifying any OEM components. The amount of work that went into it is pretty staggering as well, with [Stephan] putting in over 100 hours of work just to get the video signal timing correct. We also like it because it reminds us of the flash-in-the-pan carputer trend from the late 00s where people in the pre-smartphone age were shoving all kinds of computing horsepower in their trunks.", "title": "\u53e4\u5178BMW\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01E39\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "E39 BMW\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u7dad\u6301\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3001100\u6642\u9593\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u5178BMW\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01E39\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff0190\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u8eca\u8f09\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff1a\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "100\u6642\u9593\u306e\u52b4\u529b\uff01E39\u306b\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01\u8eca\u8f09\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068DIY\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

Making the problem simple like this can help make its fundamentals easier to understand, but when applying these assumptions to real-world problems these assumptions are quickly challenged. Which is what happened when [Seth] from Berm Peak attempted to tow a huge trailer with a bicycle  while in theory the bike just needs a big enough gear ratio he quickly found other problems with this setup that had to be solved.\n[Seth] decided on a tandem bike for this build. Not only does the second rider add power, but the longer wheelbase makes it less likely that the tongue weight of the trailer will lift the front wheel off the ground. It was modified with a Class 3 trailer hitch, as well as a battery to activate the electric trailer brakes in case of an emergency. But after hooking the trailer up the first time the problems started cropping up. At such a high gear ratio the bike is very slow and hard to keep on a straight line. Some large, custom training wheels were added between the riders to keep it stable, but even then the huge weight still caused problems with the chain and even damaged the bikes freehub at one point.\nEventually, though, [Berm Peak] was able to flat tow a Ford F-150 Lightning pulling a trailer a few yards up a hill, at least demonstrating this proof of concept. It might be the absolute most a bicycle can tow without help from an electric motor, although real-world applications for something like this are likely a bit limited. Hes been doing some other bicycle-based projects with more utility lately, including a few where he brings abandoned rental e-bikes back to life by removing proprietary components.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3067\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u727d\u5f15\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u7406\u8ad6\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7", "body": "\u7269\u7406\u306e\u300c\u7403\u4f53\u306e\u725b\u300d\u306e\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u5f15\u7528\u3057\u3001Seth\u304c\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3067\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u727d\u5f15\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u8ab2\u984c\u3082\u514b\u670d\u3057\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9f\u8a3c\u3092\u9054\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3067\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u727d\u5f15\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u7406\u8ad6\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u30bf\u30f3\u30c7\u30e0\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u6539\u9020\uff1a\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u727d\u5f15\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u9ad8\u30ae\u30a2\u6bd4\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\uff1a\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u305f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u6539\u9020\u7269\u8a9e", "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc \u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u3068\u4e08\u592b\u306a\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u9650\u754c\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

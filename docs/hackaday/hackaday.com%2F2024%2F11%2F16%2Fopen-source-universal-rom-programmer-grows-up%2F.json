But through the magic of Open-Source collaboration, revision 2 of the project overcomes all of these limitations and\u2014as you can see in the video below\u2014looks very polished.\nIf you recall, the programmer is in a shield format that can plug into an Arduino or  if you prefer a retrocomputer  a 6502uno. Along with hardware improvements from the community, [Henrik Olsson] wrote Python software to handle the programming (see the second video below).\n\nThe biggest change in the new version is that you dont have to configure the voltages with jumpers anymore. This was required because different devices draw power on different pins, but a clever two-transistor circuit lets the software handle it. There is still one jumper for switching between 32-pin and 28-pin EEPROMs. The extra transistors added four cents to the total price, although if you buy the kit from [Anders], it is still $9, just like before.\nSkimming the database, we dont see any Microcontrollers (MPUs). However, it looks like the device should be able to program flash MPUs, too.\nWe covered the first edition of this project, and we were impressed even then. We do hope people will add MPUs and other devices like PALs to the project over time.\n\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eEEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5354\u529b\u3067\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305fEEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eEEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- Arduino\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044EEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305fEEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u7c21\u4fbf\u3055", "- Python\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u6700\u65b0EEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3EEPROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u3067MPU\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01"]}

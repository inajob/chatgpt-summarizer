This technique is referred to as sound localization via time difference of arrival. [Kim Hendrikse] decided to put the technique to good use to track down the location of illicit fireworks launches.\nThe build is based on the Raspberry Pi, with [Kim] developing an autonomous recording unit complete with GPS module for determining their location and keeping everything time synchronized. By deploying a number of these units, spread out over some distance, its possible to localize loud sounds based on the time stamps they show up in the recording on each unit.\nEarly testing took place with an air horn and four recording units. [Kim] found that the technique works best for sounds made within the polygon.\u00a0 Determining the location was achieved with a sound investigation tool called Raven Lite, developed by Cornell University. The process is very manual, involving hunting for peaks in sound files, but wed love to see a version that automated comparing sound peaks across many disparate recording units. In any case, it worked incredibly well for [Kim] in practice. Later testing with friends and a network of six recorders spread over Limburg, Netherlands, [Kim] was later able to localize fireworks launches with an accuracy down to a few meters.\nSimilar techniques are used to locate gunshots, and can work well with pretty much any loud noise thats heard over a great distance. If youve been using your hacker skills to do similar investigative work, dont hesitate to let us know on the tipsline!"}

Combining lasers to project multi-colored beams onto a screen is ambitious enough, but doing it with a galvanomirror, STM32 microcontroller, and mostly scratch-built components? That\u2019s next-level tinkering. This project isn\u2019t just a feast for the eyes\u2014it\u2019s a adventure of control algorithms, hardware hacks, and the occasional oops, that didn\u2019t work. You can follow [Shoaib]s build log and join the journey here.\nThe nitty-gritty is where it gets fascinating. Shoaib digs into STM32 Timers, explaining how modes like Timer, Counter, and PWM are leveraged for precise control. From adjusting laser intensity to syncing galvos for projection, every component is tuned for maximum flexibility. Need lasers aligned? Enter spectrometry and optical diffusers for precision wavelength management. Want real-time tweaks? A Python-controlled GUI handles the instruments while keeping the setup minimalist. This isn\u2019t just a DIY build\u2014it\u2019s a work of art in problem-solving, with successes like a working simulation and implemented algorithms along the way.\nIf laser projection or STM32 wizardry excites you, this build will inspire. We featured a similar project by [Ben] back in September, and if you dig deep into our archives, you can eat your heart out on decades of laser projector projects. Explore Shoaibs complete log on Hackaday.io. It is\u2014literally\u2014hacking at its most brilliant."}

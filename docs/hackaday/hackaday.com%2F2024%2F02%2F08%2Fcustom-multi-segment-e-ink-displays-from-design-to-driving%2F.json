LEDs, LCDs, VFDs; if you want to keep your BOM at a reasonable price, youve pretty much got to settle for whatever some designer thinks looks good. And if the manufacturers aesthetic doesnt match yours, its tough luck for you.\nMaybe not though. [upir] has a thing for custom displays, leading him to explore custom-made e-ink displays. The displays are made by a company called Ynvisible, and while theyre not exactly giving away the unique-looking flexible displays, they seem pretty reasonably priced. Since the displays are made with a screen printing process, most of the video below concerns getting [upir]s preferred design into files suitable for printing. He uses Adobe Illustrator for that job, turning multi-segment design ideas by YouTuber [Posy] into chunky displays. There are some design restrictions, of course, chief of which is spacing between segments. [upir] shows off some Illustrator-fu that helps automate that process, as well as a host of general vector graphics design tips and tricks.\nAfter sending off the design files to Ynvisible and getting the flexible displays back, [upir] walks us through the details of driving them. Its not as simple as youd think, at least in the Arduino world; the segments need +1.5 volts with reference to the common connection to turn on, and -1.5 volts to turn off. His clever solution is to use an Arduino Uno R4 and take advantage of the onboard DAC. To turn on a segment, he connects a segment to a GPIO pin set high while sending 3.5 volts out of the DAC output into the displays common connection. The difference between the two pins is 1.5 volts, turning the segment on. To turn it off, he drops the DAC output to 1.5 volts and drives the common GPIO pin low. Pretty clever, and no extra circuitry is required.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen [upir] trying to jazz things up in the display department. Hes played with masking LED matrix displays with SMD stencils before, and figured out how to send custom fonts to 162 displays too.\n\n"}

The final product is slightly less curvy than the picture, but some artistic license was necessary to go from the page to the real world.\nThe enclosure itself looks straightforward, if a bit tedious, but the articulating crab controller is a work of art itself. He couldve made the arms static or non-functional, but theyre a fully-functional PlayStation controller that can move around just like on your favorite crustacean at the beach, minus the pinching. We love this whimsical take on the console mod which is a breath of salty air to the continuous race to get increasingly complex consoles into handheld form, although theres certainly nothing wrong with that!\nIf youre looking for some other console mods, how about this Apple M1 inside a Wii or getting your old Ouya up-and-running again?\n\n"}

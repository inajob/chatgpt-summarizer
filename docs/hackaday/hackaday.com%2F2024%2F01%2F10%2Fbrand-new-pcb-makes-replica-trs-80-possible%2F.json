Sadly, though, original TRS-80s are getting hard to come by, and those that are in decent enough shape to do anything interesting are commanding top dollar. [RetroStack]s obvious labor of love project provides the foundation upon which to build a brand new TRS-80 as close as possible to the original.\nThe PCB is revision G and recreates the original in every detail  component layout, connectors, silkscreen, and even trace routing. [RetroStack] even replicated obvious mistakes in the original board, like through-holes that were originally used to fixture the boards for stuffing, and some weird unused vias. There are even wrong components, or at least ones that appear on production assemblies that dont show up in the schematics. And if youre going to go through with a build, youll want to check out the collection of 3D printable parts that are otherwise unobtainium, such as the bracket for rear panel connectors and miscellaneous keyboard parts.\nWhile we love the devotion to accuracy that [RetroStack] shows with this project, we know that not everyone is of a similar bent. Luckily there are emulators and clones you can build instead. And if youre wondering why anyone would devote so much effort to half-century-old technology  well, when you know, you know.\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.\nFeature image: Dave Jones, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n", "title": "TRS-80 Model I\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046", "body": "TRS-80 Model I\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306f\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306b\u304f\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["TRS-80 Model I\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306eTRS-80\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3068\u307b\u307c\u540c\u3058TRS-80\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c", "TRS-80 Model I\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u57fa\u677f\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "TRS-80\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\uff01"]}

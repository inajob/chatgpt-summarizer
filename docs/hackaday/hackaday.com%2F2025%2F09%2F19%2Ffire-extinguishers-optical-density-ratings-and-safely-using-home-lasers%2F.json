(Credit: FauxHammer, YouTube)\nAfter [Ross] from FauxHammer miniature model fame got lured into reviewing laser engravers and similar via the Bambu Lab H2Ds laser module, he found himself getting slightly nervous about the whole safety aspect of these lasers. After all, lasers can not only light stuff on fire, but its a well-known fact that even reflected laser light can be sufficient to cause permanent damage to your retinas. Or worse.\nSince your eyes generally do not regenerate, it makes sense to get caught up on laser safety before turning on one of those plentiful-and-increasingly-affordable home laser systems for engraving and/or cutting.\nWhile the issue of stuff catching on fire is readily solved by having a good CO2 extinguisher  and plan B options  at the ready, for safety glasses its significantly more complex. Theres not just the issue of finding glasses that block the wavelength of the laser system that you are using, but also with the right optical density (OD) rating. Every mm of the safety lens material can attenuate a certain amount of laser light at the given wavelength, so the OD rating of your laser safety goggles need to match the lasers power output level, or you might be living with a false sense of security.\nFinally, there is the issue of the smoke and fumes produced by these lasers as they obliterate the target material. Much of what is in this smoke you do not want to breathe in, even ignoring long-term dust and VOC exposure issues, so having a solid fume extraction setup and PPE as necessary are absolute necessities. As [Ross] puts it, you dont want to breathe in the smell of regret today, for your future self to reflect on a decade from now.\nWork safe, work smart, dont become the subject of a laser safety PSA.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5b89\u5168\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1a\u76ee\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "body": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u4f5c\u696d\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u9069\u5207\u306a\u4fdd\u8b77\u773c\u93e1\u3068\u6392\u6c17\u8a2d\u5099\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5b89\u5168\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1a\u76ee\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56", "- \u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30af\u3068\u7159\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6642\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u88c5\u5099", "- \u5b89\u5168\u7b2c\u4e00\uff01\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u4f5c\u696d\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u6574\u3048\u65b9"]}

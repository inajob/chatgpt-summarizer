For [Gauthier], getting up to open or close the window every three minutes so their cat can go out on the balcony was a bridge too far, so they decided to take a crack at automating the window. The end result not only does the job, its extremely low-tech and pretty much invisible except when in use.\nOf course, [Gauthier] didnt arrive at this solution immediately. Their first thoughts went to RFID or perhaps a pressure sensor to detect the cats, coupled with something motorized to open and shut the window, like a belt or maybe a linear actuator. But ultimately, the system has to be robust, so thats when [Gauthier] got the idea to employ gravity by using pulleys and weights.\nDue to the configuration of the space and the shape of the window, [Gauthier] was able to to hide cable pretty well  you cant really see anything when the window is closed. Be sure to check it out in action after the break. \n\n \n\n", "title": "\u300c\u611b\u732b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff01\u7a93\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u4f4e\u30c6\u30af\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u300d", "body": "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u7a93\u3092\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u958b\u3051\u9589\u3081\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u9762\u5012\u3060\u3063\u305f[Gauthier]\u6c0f\u304c\u7a93\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u3002\u6700\u521d\u306fRFID\u3084\u5727\u529b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u91cd\u308a\u3068\u6ed1\u8eca\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002\u7a93\u304c\u9589\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6642\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u76ee\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u611b\u732b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff01\u7a93\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u4f4e\u30c6\u30af\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u300d", "\u300cRFID\u3084\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\uff01\u7a93\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u958b\u9589\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u91cd\u529b\u3068\u6ed1\u8eca\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\uff01\u7a93\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u732b\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u7a93\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u96a0\u308c\u305f\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\uff01\u7a93\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u300d"]}

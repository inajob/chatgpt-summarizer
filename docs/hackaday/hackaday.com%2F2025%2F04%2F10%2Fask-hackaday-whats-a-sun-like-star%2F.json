Of course, the answer is it is and it isnt. Saying something is like something else presupposes a lot of hidden assumptions. In the category things with two wheels, we have a winner. In the category things that require gasoline, not so much. Weve noticed before that news stories about astronomy often talk about sun-like stars or Earth-like planets. But what does that really mean? [Paul Gilster] had the same questions, if you want to read his opinion about it.\n[Paul] mentions that even textbooks cant agree. He found one that said that Centauri A was sun-like while Centauri B was sometimes considered sun-like and other times not. So while Paul was looking at the examples of press releases and trying to make sense of it all, we thought wed just ask you. What makes a star like our sun? What makes a planet like our planet?\n\nPart of the problem is we dont really know as much as we would like about other planets and their stars. We know more than we used to, of course. Still, it would be like wondering if the motorcycle was like that distant point of light. Maybe.\nThis is one of those things that seems deceptively simple until you start thinking about it. Is a planet Earth-like if it is full of water? What if it is totally covered in water? What if theres no life at all? But life isnt it, either. Methane-breathing silicon-based life probably doesnt live on Earth-like planets.\nMaybe Justice Potter Stewart was on to something when he said, I know it when I see it! Unfortunately, thats not very scientific.\nSo what do you think? Whats a sun-like star? Whats an Earth-like planet? Discuss in the comments.\nDont even get us started on super-earths, whatever they are. We are learning more about our neighbors every day, though."}

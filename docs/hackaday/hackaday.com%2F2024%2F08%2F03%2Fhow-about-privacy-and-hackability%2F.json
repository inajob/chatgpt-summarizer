[Jeff Sandberg] used an RTL-SDR dongle and some software to integrate this data into his own home automation system, which lets him keep track of his home\u2019s power usage.\nHalf of the comment section was appalled that the meters broadcast this data in the clear, and these readers thought this data should be encrypted even if the reach is limited to the home-owner\u2019s front yard. But that would have stopped [Jeff] from accessing his own data as well, and that would be a shame. So there\u2019s clearly a tradeoff in play here.\nWe see this tradeoff in a lot of hardware devices as well \u2013 we want to be able to run our firmware on them, but we don\u2019t want criminals to do the same. We want the smart device to work with the cloud service, but to also work with our own home automation system if we have one. And we want to be able to listen in to our smart meters, but don\u2019t necessarily want others to do so.\nThe solution here is as easy as it is implausible that it will get implemented. If the smart meters transmitted encrypted, each with their own individual password, then everyone would win. The meter reader would have a database of passwords linked to meter serial numbers or addresses, and the home owner could just read it off of a sticker, optimally placed on each unit. Privacy and usability would be preserved.\nThis issue isn\u2019t just limited to electric meters. Indeed, think of all of the data that is being sent out from or about you, and what percentage of it is not encrypted and should be, but also about what data is sent out encrypted that you could use access to. The solution is to put you in control of the encryption, by selecting a password or having access to one that\u2019s set for you. Because after all, if it\u2019s your data, it should be your data: private and usable.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

For general processing photonics is currently less common, but is the subject of significant research. Unlike most photonic circuits which are formed using patterns etched into semiconductor mask using lithography, purely light-based circuits are a tantalizing possibility. This is the focus of a recent paper (press release, ResearchGate) in Nature Photonics by [Tianwei Wu] and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania.\nWhat is somewhat puzzling is that despite the lofty claims of this being the first time that such an FPGA-like device has been created for photonics, this is far from the case, as evidenced by e.g. a 2017 paper by [Kaichen Dong] and colleagues (full\u00a0 article PDF) in Advanced Materials.\u00a0Here the researchers used a slab of vanadium dioxide (VO2) with a laser to heat sections to above 68 \u00b0C where the material transitions from an insulating to a metallic phase and remains that way until the temperature is lowered again. The \u03bcm-sized features that can be created in this manner allow for a wide range of photonic devices to be created.\nA rewritable metacanvas. a) Schematic of laser writing different photonic operator patterns on a metacanvas. b) Temperature-dependent resistance of a VO2 film. c) Optical images from writing and erasing process on the metacanvas. . d) Diagram showing the mathematical matrix (F) is compiled onto a metacanvas in the form of a photonic operator for manipulation of light waveform. e) Schematic of a metacanvas programmed as a beam steerer with a steering angle \u03d5. (Credit: Dong et al., 2018)\nWhat does appear to be different with the photonic system presented by [Wu] et al. is that it uses a more traditional 2D approach, with a slab of InGaAsP on which the laser pattern is projected. Whether it is more versatile than other approaches remains to be seen, with the use of fully photonic processors in our computers still a long while off, never mind photonics-accelerated machine learning applications.", "title": "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4e00\u65b0\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u5149\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5149\u3060\u3051\u3067\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u8a66\u307f\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a66\u307f\u306b\u3001\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u30d0\u30cb\u30a2\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u8ca2\u732e\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u30012017\u5e74\u306b\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u5149\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u56de\u8def\u3092\u518d\u66f8\u304d\u63db\u3048\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4e00\u65b0\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u5149\u306b\u3088\u308b\u56de\u8def\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "2017\u5e74\u4ee5\u964d\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03\u3059\u308b", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b2D\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u8ab2\u984c"]}

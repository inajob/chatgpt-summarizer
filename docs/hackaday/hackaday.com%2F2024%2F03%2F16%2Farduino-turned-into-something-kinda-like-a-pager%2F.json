They still exist, of course, but only in very niche applications. [Jo\u00e3o Santos] wanted a pager-like experience for himself, though, so he enlisted an Arduino and got to work. Watch a video of the system working below.\nThe build uses an Arduino Uno to drive a simple HD44780 LCD display with 16 characters each across two lines of text. Its hooked up to a Wemos D1, which uses its WiFi connection to get online. To this end, its capable of talking to a web application which allows users to enter text messages. It receives these messages, passes them to the Arduino Uno over I2C, and then the Uno shuttles the message to the display. Its overkill, but [Jo\u00e3o] just found it quicker to get everything up and running via this route.\n\nThose who want to message [Jo\u00e3o] via the system can head to a website that runs on the OutSystems platform. There, they can enter their name and message, and it will be sent to the pager-like device for display.\nIts a fun little thing, and it makes us wonder if pagers could make a comeback. Maybe simple devices could work in a similar way to Sidewalk or Apple AirTags, communicating via a low-power network made up of smartphones in the local area. Weve seen something similar done with LoRa. If you happen to whip up something along those lines, dont hesitate to let us know!\n"}

He puts the machine through its paces, noting that the 7 inch touchscreen is a pretty nice feature for those whose eyesight isnt quite what it used to be.\nThe internals are similar to the nanoVNA-F V3, but not identical.\nWhats a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)? Its not for testing Ethernet or WiFi. Its aimed at a more classical type of network. The VNA tests and evaluates characteristics of electrical networks, especially as related to RF and microwave.\nIt provides detailed information about properties across a specified frequency range, making it an indispensable tool for advanced work. Tektronix has a resource page that goes into detail about exactly what kinds of things a VNA is good for.\n[Kerry] shows off a few different features and sample tests before pulling the unit apart. In the end, hes satisfied with the features and performance of the device, especially the large screen and sensible user interface.\nAfter all, not every piece of test equipment does a great job at fulfilling its primary function, like the cheap oscilloscope that was a perhaps a little too cheap.\n\n"}

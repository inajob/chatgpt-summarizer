What started out as a pasta-making version of those Play-Doh hair people quickly morphed into a more scaled-back endeavor with simply extruding pasta through the mannequins chin to create pasta hair.\nInitial attempts at using a basketball to extrude clay (used as a pasta stand-in) through holes in a mannequins head were unsuccessful, so [Giertz] turned to a more conventional pasta gun to handle the pasta extrusion. Since the gun didnt have the volume necessary to produce a full head of hair, or even a respectable mustache, the next mannequins chin was subjected to multiple drill holes for pasta to escape in a hairy tangle.\nThe results arent exactly appetizing, but it definitely does make edible pasta. If youre looking for more pasta hacks, how about ramen in an edible package, flat pack pasta, or Barillas Open Source pasta tool?\n\n"}

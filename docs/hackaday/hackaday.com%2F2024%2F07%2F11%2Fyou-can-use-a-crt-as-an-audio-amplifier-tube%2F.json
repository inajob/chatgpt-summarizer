Were not normally talking about big ol color CRTs, but apparently they can do the job too. Thats what [Termadnator] is here to show us.\nThe CRT in question is a 14 unit from a common garden variety Philips color TV.\u00a0 [Termadnator] pulled out the TVs original circuitry, and replaced much of it with his own. He had to whip up a high-voltage power supply with a 555 and a laptop power supply, along with a bunch of fake MOSFETs pressed into service. He also had to build his own Leyden jar capacitor, too. The specifics of converting it to audio operation get a bit messy, but fear not\u2014[Termadnator] explains the idea well, and also supplies a schematic. Perhaps the coolest thing, though, is the crazy color pattern that appears on the display when its working as an amp.\nSound output isnt exactly loud, and its a little distorted, too. Still, its amusing to see an entire TV instead doing the job of a single amplifier tube. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to bugminer for the tip!]", "title": "\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u7ba1\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\uff1a14\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1CRT\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "CRT\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002TV\u306e\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u3001555\u3068\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u96fb\u6e90\u3067\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3002\u8272\u3068\u308a\u3069\u308a\u306e\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u97f3\u8cea\u306f\u3084\u3084\u6b6a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u7ba1\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\uff1a14\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1CRT\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305fCRT\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7", "\u30ec\u30a4\u30c7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u7570\u8272\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u306a\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059CRT\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u4e00\u53f0\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3059\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

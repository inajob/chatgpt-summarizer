Were not normally talking about big ol color CRTs, but apparently they can do the job too. Thats what [Termadnator] is here to show us.\nThe CRT in question is a 14 unit from a common garden variety Philips color TV.\u00a0 [Termadnator] pulled out the TVs original circuitry, and replaced much of it with his own. He had to whip up a high-voltage power supply with a 555 and a laptop power supply, along with a bunch of fake MOSFETs pressed into service. He also had to build his own Leyden jar capacitor, too. The specifics of converting it to audio operation get a bit messy, but fear not\u2014[Termadnator] explains the idea well, and also supplies a schematic. Perhaps the coolest thing, though, is the crazy color pattern that appears on the display when its working as an amp.\nSound output isnt exactly loud, and its a little distorted, too. Still, its amusing to see an entire TV instead doing the job of a single amplifier tube. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to bugminer for the tip!]"}

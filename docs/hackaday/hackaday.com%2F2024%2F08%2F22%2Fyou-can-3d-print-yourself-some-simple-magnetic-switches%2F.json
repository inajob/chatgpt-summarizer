Theyre always doing their magnet thing. However, if you align them with a bunch of other\u00a0magnets in just the right way, you can create a permanent magnet that you can effectively switch on and off.\u00a0[Andrew Klein] has done just that with his 3D-printed magnetic switch design.\nThe concept is simple enough. The design consists of a 3D-printed housing in two parts, top and bottom. When set into one orientation, the housing holds two arrays of magnets in opposite orientations. This effectively cancels out their magnetic fields and allows you to move the assembly around as if its pretty much not magnetic at all. However, rotate the device to its alternative orientation, and the magnets poles are aligned. This effectively combines their magnetic fields and makes the assembly act as one big large magnet.\nThese devices are useful if you want to create magnetic clamps or fixtures that can be attached and detached at will from ferrous surfaces. Being able to effectively switch the magnet off is much easier than trying to wrench a powerful magnet from a metal plate, after all.\nYou can do something similar with electromagnetic techniques, too!

First up in the news  its giga-sunset time for Gigaset IoT devices, which simultaneously became paperweights on March 29th. And all that Flipper Zero panic? It has spread to Australia, but still remains exactly that: panic.\nThen its on to Whats That Sound. Kristina failed again, although she was in the right neighborhood. Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nThen its on to the hacks, beginning with the terrifying news of an xz backdoor. From there, we marvel at a 1980s butler in a box  a voice-activated home automation system  and at the idea of LoRa transmissions without a radio. Finally, we discuss why you dont want to piss off Trekkies, and whether AI has any place in tech support.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 265 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nA Giga-Sunset For Gigaset IoT Devices\nFlipper Zero Panic Spreads To Oz: Cars Unaffected\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out this form with your best guess, and you might win!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nSecurity Alert: Potential SSH Backdoor Via Liblzma\n\nExploit The Stressed-out Package Maintainer, Exploit The Software Package\nxkcd: Dependency\noss-security  backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma leading to ssh server compromise\n\n\nRetrogadgets: Butler In A Box\nLoRA, With No Radio\nGive Your Pi Pico Captouch Inputs For All Your Music Needs\nElectrospinning Artificial Heart Valves\nExperiencing Visual Deficits And Their Impact On Daily Life, With VR\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nCold Boot Attack You Can Do With A Pi\nESP-Drone: Building An ESP32-Based Quadcopter For Not Much Cash\nSMD Soldering, Without The Blobs\nWhy Is My 470uF Electrolytic Cap More Like 20uF?\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\nArt Exhibit Lets You Hide From Self-Driving Cars\nVideo Killed The Radio Alarm Clock\nLamp Becomes Rotating, Illuminated Sign For Festival Table\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nHow Star Trek Breached The Defences Of A Major Broadcaster\nTech Support\u2026 Can AI Be Worse?\n\nWrencher-2: A Bold New Direction For Hackaday\n\n\n"}

He hasnt finished yet, but progress has been made.\nIf you were wondering what might be involved in a high-speed Ethernet switch implementation look no further. Hes been working on this project, on and off, since 2012. His design now includes a dizzying array of parts. [Andrew] managed to snag some XCKU5P FPGAs for cheap, paying two cents in the dollar, and having access to this fairly high-powered hardware affected the projects direction.\n\nYou might be familiar with [Andrew Zonenberg] as we have heard from him before. Hes the guy who gave us the glscopeclient, which is now ngscopeclient.\nAs perhaps you know, when he says in his report that he is an experienced RTL engineer, he is talking about Register-Transfer Level, which is an abstraction layer used by hardware description languages, such as Verilog and VHDL, which are used to program FPGAs. When he says RTL hes not talking about Resistor-Transistor Logic (an ancient method of developing digital hardware) or the equally ancient line of Realtek Ethernet controllers such as the RTL8139.\nWhen it comes to open-source software you can usually get a copy at no cost. With open-source hardware, on the other hand, you might find yourself needing to fork out for some very expensive bits of kit. High speed is still expensive! And proprietary, for now. If youre looking to implement Ethernet hardware today, you will have to stick with something slower. Otherwise, stay tuned, and watch this space.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u9032\u884c\u4e2d", "body": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30fb\u30be\u30cd\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0\u304c\u9032\u3081\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9ad8\u901fEthernet\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u5831\u544a\u30022012\u5e74\u304b\u3089\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3067\u304a\u308a\u3001\u9032\u5c55\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u9032\u884c\u4e2d", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30fb\u30be\u30cd\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u9ad8\u901f\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "- XCKU5P FPGA\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\uff01"]}

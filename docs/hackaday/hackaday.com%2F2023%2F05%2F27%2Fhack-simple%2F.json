But today I\u2019d like to raise a rhetorical glass in tribute of the simple hacks. Because, to be perfectly honest, the vast majority of my hacks are simple hacks, and it\u2019s probably the same for you too. And these often go unsung because, well, they\u2019re simple. But that doesn\u2019t mean that something simple can\u2019t be helpful.\nCase in point: an ESP8266 press-buttons device that we featured this week. It doesn\u2019t do much. It\u2019s main feature is that it connects to a home automation network over WiFi and enables you to flip three relays. Wires coming off the board are to be soldered to the not-yet-smart device in question, simply connected to each side of the button you\u2019d like to press. In the example, a coffee machine was turned on and the \u201cgo\u201d button pressed, automating one of the most essential kitchen rituals. While recording the podcast, I realized that I\u2019ve built essentially this device and have it controlling our house\u2019s heating furnace.\nFor the experienced hacker, there\u2019s not much here. It\u2019s a simple board design, the software heavily leverages ESPHome, so there\u2019s not much work on that front either. But imagine that you lacked any of the wide-ranging skills that it takes to make such a device: PCB layout, ESP8266 software wrangling, or the nuances of designing with relays. You could just as easily build this device wrong as right. The startup costs are non-trivial.\nMaking a simple design like this available to the public isn\u2019t a technical flex, and it\u2019s not contributing to the cutting edge. But it just might be giving someone their first taste of DIY home automation, and a sweet taste of success. There\u2019s not much easier than finding a switch and soldering on two wires, but if that\u2019s the spark that pushes them on their path to greater hacks, that\u2019s awesome. And even if it doesn\u2019t, at least it\u2019s another appliance under user control, connected to a private WiFi network rather than spying you out and phoning home to Big Toaster.\nSo here\u2019s to the simple hacks!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

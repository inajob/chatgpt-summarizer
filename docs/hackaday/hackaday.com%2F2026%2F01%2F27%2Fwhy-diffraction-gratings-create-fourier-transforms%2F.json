At the time, he noted that the diffraction pattern was a frequency decomposition of the specimen\u2019s features \u2013 in other terms, a Fourier transform. Now, he\u2019s back with an explanation of why this is, deriving equations for the Fourier transform from the first principles of diffraction (German video, but with auto-translated English subtitles. Beware: what should be \u201cHuygens principle\u201d is variously translated as \u201csquirrel principle,\u201d \u201cprinciple of hearing,\u201d and \u201cprinciple of the horn\u201d).\nThe first assumption was that light is a wave that can be adequately represented by a sinusoidal function. For the sake of simplicity (you\u2019ll have to take our word for this), the formula for a sine wave was converted to a complex number in exponential form. According to the Huygens principle, when light emerges from a point in the sample, it spreads out in spherical waves, and the wave at a given point can therefore be calculated simply as a function of distance. The principle of superposition means that whenever two waves pass through the same point, the amplitude at that point is the sum of the two. Extending this summation to all the various light sources emerging from the sample resulted in an infinite integral, which simplified to a particular form of the Fourier transform.\nOne surprising consequence of the relation is the JPEG representation of a micrograph of some onion cells. JPEG compression calculates the Fourier transform of an image and stores it as a series of sine-wave striped patterns. If one arranges tiles of these striped patterns according to stripe frequency and orientation, then shades each tile according to that pattern\u2019s contribution to the final image, one gets a speckle pattern with a bright point in the center. This closely resembles the diffraction pattern created by shining a laser through those onion cells.\nFor the original experiment that generated these patterns, check out [xoreaxeax]\u2019s original ptychographical microscope. Going in the opposite direction, researchers have also used physical structures to calculate Fourier transforms.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u7121\u3057\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u306e\u89e3\u660e", "body": "[xoreaxeax]\u306f\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u8a66\u6599\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a8\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u767a\u5c55\u3055\u305b\u3001\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u306e\u539f\u7406\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u7121\u3057\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u306e\u89e3\u660e", "\u5149\u306e\u56de\u6298\u304b\u3089\u5c0e\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u306e\u6570\u5f0f", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30b2\u30f3\u30ba\u539f\u7406\u3068\u5149\u306e\u6ce2\u52d5\u7279\u6027", "JPEG\u5727\u7e2e\u3068\u5fae\u7d30\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u767a\u898b: \u56de\u6298\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u89e3\u6790"]}

And naturally, we like to share our hacks with our pets. Whether it\u2019s a robot ball-thrower, a hamster wheel that\u2019s integrated into your smart home system, or even just an automatic feeder for when you\u2019re not home, we want to see what kind of projects that your animal friends have inspired you to pull off.\nThe three top choices will take home $150 gift certificates from DigiKey, the contest\u2019s sponsor, so that you can make even more pet-centric projects. You have until May 27th to get your project up on Hackaday.io, and get it entered into Pet Hacks.\n\nHonorable Mention Categories\nOf course, we have a couple thoughts about fun directions to take this contest, and we\u2019ll be featuring entries along the way. Just to whet your whistle, here are our four honorable mention categories.\n\nPet Safety: Nothing is better than a hack that helps your pet stay out of trouble. If your hack contributes to pet safety, we want to see it.\nPlayful Pets: Some hacks are just for fun, and that goes for our pet hacks too. If it\u2019s about amusing either your animal friend or even yourself, it\u2019s a playful pet hack.\nCyborg Pets: Sometimes the hacks aren\u2019t for your pet, but on your pet. Custom pet prosthetics or simply ultra-blinky LED accouterments belong here.\nHome Alone: This category is for systems that aim to make your pet more autonomous. That\u2019s not limited to vacation feeders \u2013 anything that helps your pet get along in this world designed for humans is fair game.\n\nInspiration\nWe\u2019ve seen an amazing number of pet hacks here at Hackaday, from simple to wildly overkill. And we love them all! Here are a few of our favorite pet hacks past, but feel free to chime in the comments if you have one that didn\u2019t make our short list.\nLet\u2019s start off with a fishy hack. Simple aquariums don\u2019t require all that much attention or automation, so they\u2019re a great place to start small with maybe a light controller or something that turns off your wave machine every once in a while. But when you get to the point of multiple setups, you might also want to spend a little more time on the automation. Or at least that\u2019s how we imagine that [Blue Blade Fish] got to the point of a system with multiple light setups, temperature control, water level sensing, and more. It\u2019s a 15-video series, so buckle in.\nOK, now let\u2019s talk cats. Cats owners know they can occasionally bring in dead mice, for which a computer-vision augmented automatic door is the obvious solution. Or maybe your cats spend all their time in the great outdoors? Then you\u2019ll need a weather-proof automatic feeder for the long haul. Indoor cats, each with a special diet? Let the Cat-o-Matic 3000 keep track of who has been fed. But for the truly pampered feline, we leave for your consideration the cat elevator and the sun-tracking chair.\nDogs are more your style? We\u2019ve seen a number of automatic ball launchers for when you just get tired of playing fetch. But what tugged hardest at our heartstrings was [Bud]\u2019s audible go-fetch toy that he made for his dog [Lucy] when she lost her vision, but not her desire to keep playing. How much tech is too much tech? A dog-borne WiFi hotspot, or a drone set up to automatically detect and remove the dreaded brown heaps?\nFinally, we\u2019d like to draw your attention to some truly miscellaneous pet hacks. [Mr.\u00a0Goxx] is a hamster who trades crypto, [Mr.\u00a0Fluffbutt] runs in a VR world simulation hamster wheel, and [Harold] posts his workouts over MQTT \u2013 it\u2019s the Internet of Hamsters after all. Have birds? Check out this massive Chicken McMansion or this great vending machine that trains crows to clean up cigarette butts in exchange for peanuts.\nWe had a lot of fun looking through Hackaday\u2019s back-catalog of pet hacks, but we\u2019re still missing yours! If you\u2019ve got something you\u2019d like us all to see, head on over to Hackaday.io and enter it in the contest. Fame, fortune, and a DigiKey gift certificate await!\n\n \n\n"}

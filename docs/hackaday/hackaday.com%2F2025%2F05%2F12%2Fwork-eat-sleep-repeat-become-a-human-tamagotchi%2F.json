He ditched the entire concept and rebuilt it from the ground up. Forget cute wide-eyed blobby animals and pixel-poop. This Raspberry Pi-powered project ditches nostalgia in favour of brutal realism: inflation, burnout, capitalism, and the occasional existential crisis. Think Sims meets cyberpunk, rendered charmingly in Python on a low-res RGB LED matrix.\nInstead of hunger and poop meters, this dystopian pet juggles Maslows hierarchy: hunger, rest, safety, social life, esteem, and money. Players make real-life-inspired decisions like working, socialising, and going into education  each affecting the stats in logical (and often unfair) ways. No free lunch here: food requires money, money requires mind-numbing labour, and labour tanks your rest. You can even die of overwork \u00e0 la Amazon warehouse. The UI and animation logic are all hand-coded, and theres a working buzzer, pixel-perfect sprite movement, and even mini-games to simulate job repetition.\nIts equal parts social commentary and pixel art fever dream. While we have covered Tamagotchi recreations some time ago, this one makes you the needy survivor. Want your own dystopia in 6432? Head over to [Terence Grover]s Github and fork the full open source code. Well be watching. The Tamagotchi certainly is.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u9078\u629e\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1\u98a8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u63d0\u6848\u300d", "body": "\u30c6\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1\u98a8\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u73fe\u5b9f\u793e\u4f1a\u3092\u53cd\u6620\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u629e\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u9078\u629e\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1\u98a8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u63d0\u6848\u300d", "- \u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f\u793e\u4f1a\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3055\u305b\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300d", "- \u300c\u52b4\u50cd\u3068\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u3055\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cMaslow\u306e\u968e\u5c64\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d", "- \u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u672a\u6765\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u9032\u5316\u300d"]}

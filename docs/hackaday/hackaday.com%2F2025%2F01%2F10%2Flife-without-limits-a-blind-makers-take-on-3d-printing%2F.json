Using OpenSCAD and a 3D printer, [Mrblindguardian] designs and prints models independently, relying on speech software and touch to bring his ideas to life. His story, published on his website Accessible3D.io, is a call to action for makers to embrace accessibility in their designs and tools.\n[Mrblindguardian]\u2019s approach to 3D printing with OpenSCAD is fascinating. Without visual cues, he can still code every detail of his designs, like a tactile emergency plan for his workplace. The challenges are there: navigating software as a blind user, mastering 3D printers, and building from scratch. His tip: start small. Taking on a very simple project allows you to get accustomed to the software while avoiding pressure and frustation.\nHis successes highlight how persistence, community support, and creativity can break barriers. His journey mirrors efforts by others, like 3D printed braille maps or accessible prosthetics, each turning daily limitations into ingenious innovations. [Mrblindguardian] seems to be out to empower others, so bookmark his page for that whats yet to come.\nAccessible tech isn\u2019t just about empowering. Share your thoughts in the comments if you have similar experiences  or good solutions to limitations like these! As [Mrblindguardian] says on his blog: take the leap. Let\u2019s turn the impossible into the tangible\u2014one layer at a time.\n\nI am fully blind, and this is how I 3d design and print independantly byu/Mrblindguardian inprusa3d\n", "title": "- \u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u304c\u6311\u3080\uff01\u72ec\u81ea\u306e3D\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "body": "\u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u3092\u6301\u3064[Mrblindguardian]\u306f\u30013D\u5370\u5237\u3067\u72ec\u81ea\u306b\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b7\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8996\u899a\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u304c\u6311\u3080\uff01\u72ec\u81ea\u306e3D\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b7\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\uff01\u8996\u899a\u306b\u983c\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u969c\u58c1\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u5275\u9020\u529b\uff1aMrblindguardian\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "- \u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5f62\u306b\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b7\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u5171\u540c\u4f53\u306e\u529b"]}

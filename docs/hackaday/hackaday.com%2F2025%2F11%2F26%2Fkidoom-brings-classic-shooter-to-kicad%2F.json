The corollary here is that if some software displays things, someone will figure out a way to make it render the iconic shooter. Case in point KiDoom by [Mike Ayles], which happily renders DOOM in KiCad at a sedate 10 to 25 frames per second as you blast away at your PCB routing demons.\nObviously, the game isnt running directly in KiCad, but it does use the\u00a0doomgeneric DOOM engine in a separate process, with KiCads PCB editor handling the rendering. As noted by [Mike], he could have used a Python version of DOOM to target KiCads Python API, but thats left as an exercise for the reader.\nRather than having the engine render directly to a display, [Mike] wrote code to extract the position of sprites and wall segments, which is then sent to KiCad via its Python interface, updating the view and refreshing the PCB. Controls are as usual, though youll be looking at QFP-64 package footprints for enemies, SOIC-8 for decorations and SOT-23-3 packages for health, ammo and keys.\nIf youre itching to give it a try, the GitHub project can be found right here. Maybe itll bring some relief after a particularly frustrating PCB routing session.", "title": "KiCad\u3067DOOM\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u878d\u5408", "body": "KiCad\u3067DOOM\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u300cKiDoom\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002PCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u904a\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["KiCad\u3067DOOM\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u878d\u5408", "PCB\u30eb\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u4e2d\u306bDOOM\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "KiCad\u3067\u63cf\u304fDOOM\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u306eKiDoom\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "KiCad\u3068DOOM\u304c\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u611f\u899a\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

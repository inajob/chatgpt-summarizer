[Tom Gralewicz] has found himself in a pickle, though, often working on projects with voltages like 36V or 48V. Suddenly, its no longer practical to throw an LED and a resistor on a line to verify if its powered or not. Craving this simplicity, [Tom] invented the Cheap Universal LED Driver, or CULD, to do the job instead.\nThe CULD is designed as a simple LED indicator that will light up anywhere from 5V to 50V. Its intended to be set-and-forget, requiring no fussing with different resistor values and no worries for the end user that excessive current draw will result.\nThe key part ended up being the LV2862XLVDDCR  a cheap switching regulator. It can output 1 mA to 600 mA to drive one or several LEDs, and it can do so anywhere from a 4V to 60V input. Assemble this on a coin-sized PCB with some LEDs, and youve got your nifty do-everything indicator light. With a bridge rectifier onboard, itll even work on AC circuits, too.\n[Tom] has built a handful himself, but he open-sourced the design in the hopes it will go further. By his calculations, it would be possible to build these in quantities of 1000 for a BOM cost of less than $0.50 each, not counting assembly or the PCB itself. Wed love to see them become a standard part of hacker toolkits, too. If youve got a pick-and-place plant thats looking for work this week, maybe get them on to something like this and see what you can do! If it turns out to be a goer, maybe drop us a note on the tipsline, yeah?", "title": "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3067\u3082LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb \"Cheap Universal LED Driver\uff08CULD\uff09\" \u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "36V\u308448V\u306e\u96fb\u5727\u3067\u306eLED\u99c6\u52d5\u304c\u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u76f4\u9762\u3057\u305f[Tom]\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bCheap Universal LED Driver (CULD)\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002BOM\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306f$0.50\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u3001AC\u56de\u8def\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671f\u5f85\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3067\u3082LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb \"Cheap Universal LED Driver\uff08CULD\uff09\" \u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "5V\u304b\u308950V\u307e\u3067\u5bfe\u5fdc\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "AC\u56de\u8def\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305fLED\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "1000\u500b\u3067$0.50\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308bLED\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u300cCULD\u300d\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u5fc5\u9700\u54c1\uff1f\u300cCULD\u300d\u306e\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046"]}

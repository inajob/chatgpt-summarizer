[Tom Gralewicz] has found himself in a pickle, though, often working on projects with voltages like 36V or 48V. Suddenly, its no longer practical to throw an LED and a resistor on a line to verify if its powered or not. Craving this simplicity, [Tom] invented the Cheap Universal LED Driver, or CULD, to do the job instead.\nThe CULD is designed as a simple LED indicator that will light up anywhere from 5V to 50V. Its intended to be set-and-forget, requiring no fussing with different resistor values and no worries for the end user that excessive current draw will result.\nThe key part ended up being the LV2862XLVDDCR  a cheap switching regulator. It can output 1 mA to 600 mA to drive one or several LEDs, and it can do so anywhere from a 4V to 60V input. Assemble this on a coin-sized PCB with some LEDs, and youve got your nifty do-everything indicator light. With a bridge rectifier onboard, itll even work on AC circuits, too.\n[Tom] has built a handful himself, but he open-sourced the design in the hopes it will go further. By his calculations, it would be possible to build these in quantities of 1000 for a BOM cost of less than $0.50 each, not counting assembly or the PCB itself. Wed love to see them become a standard part of hacker toolkits, too. If youve got a pick-and-place plant thats looking for work this week, maybe get them on to something like this and see what you can do! If it turns out to be a goer, maybe drop us a note on the tipsline, yeah?"}

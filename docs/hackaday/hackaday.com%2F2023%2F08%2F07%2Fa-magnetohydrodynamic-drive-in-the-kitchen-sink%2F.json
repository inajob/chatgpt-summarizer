As long as you can provide it with a constant supply of electricity, anyway.\nOf course, as is often the case, the devil is in the details. Even with the obvious scientific and military applications of such a propulsion unit, scaling MHD technology up has proven difficult. But as [Jay Bowles] of Plasma Channel shows in his latest video, that doesnt mean you cant experiment with the concept at home. Even better, getting verifiable results is much easier than youd think.\n\nA pair of electrodes and a single magnet is all it takes to get measurable results.\nWhile [Jay] usually wont even get out of bed for less than a dozen kilovolts, a standard bench supply is all you need to power your very own MHD. He ran his experiential drive at a maximum of 25 VDC/9 A, but he was getting results with just 5 VDC/1.5 A. Beyond that, its just a matter of cutting some electrodes out of metal stock and placing them on either side of the most powerful magnets you can get your hands on. Add in a 3D-printed structure and some pieces of acrylic, and youre halfway to a bathtub rendition of The Hunt for Red October.\nIn the video, [Jay] progresses through several experiments that test variables such as the electrode spacing, magnetic field strength, and applied voltage  noting how each change impacts the velocity of water passing through his test rig. The results indicate that the MHD, at least on such a small scale, is remarkably forgiving regarding design specifics. Line your electrodes up with the magnets, flip on the power, and it seems like something will happen pretty much no matter what. If you want the best performance, the formula seems straightforward: more power + bigger magnets = higher velocity.\nElectricity and salt water dont get along terribly well.\nThe final prototype thruster has a mass of 35 grams and produces approximately 75 grams of thrust while consuming 225 watts. Thats pretty impressive for a first attempt, especially for something mainly built from hardware store components.\nIt seems like the biggest problem is that the brass electrodes end up looking pretty rough after a relatively short time. Were pretty sure we even saw metal flakes flying out of the back of the unit while it was operating a few times. As such, its unclear how long the unit could provide thrust before electrolysis really starts to take its toll. But hey, thats what version two is for, right?\n[Jay] says he was inspired to look into the magnetohydrodynamic drive after building a high-voltage\u00a0catamaran, which is itself a spin-off of his ongoing efforts to build an ion-powered aircraft.\n"}

Alongside the new board comes something else, an updated Raspberry Pi OS version.\nThis is built from Debian 12 Bookworm, and supplants the previous Bullseye version. As well as the new OS base it comes with a pile of Pi-specific upgrades including an optimsied version of Mozilla Firefox. Probably most important is that henceforth (at least on 64-bit boards) its desktop will use the Wayland compositor rather than X11 to draw and manipulate windows. This is a development that has been in the works for a very long time  it must be almost a decade since the first Raspberry Pi blog entry about Wayland  so its welcome at last to see it.\nThe new tweaks as well as Wayland are supposed to deliver a much faster Pi experience, so we thought wed break out the stopwatch and do some rough real-world tests. The bench 8GB Pi 4 here has a vanilla 64-bit Bullseye installed, so off we went to measure boot time, Chromium browser opening time, and Hackaday load time. It was time to download the new 64-bit Bookworm image and do the same. Have we just downloaded a power-up?\nBoth tests were done with an everyday boot, after the first-time OS set-up, and with all browser caches emptied. First up was a significant boost, with Bookworm booting in 37.14 seconds to Bullseyes 53.5, but the Chromium opening was a little more disappointing. On Bullseye it took 7.15s, while Bookworms Chromium managed a more pedestrian 9.13s. The new Firefox takes only 7.95s to open. Both Chromium browsers load Hackaday in about 1.8s, while the new Firefox did the same job in a shade over 3s.\nSo allowing for our stopwatch reaction time and the ad-hoc nature of the test, this is a faster-booting OS, but the underlying hardware is still the limiting factor. Were disappointed to see that theres no update for the x86 version of the Raspberry Pi Desktop, and we hope theyll be able to rectify this in the future.", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3001Pi 5\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u58f2\uff01\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305fOS\u3082\u540c\u68b1\uff01", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001Pi 5\u3068\u66f4\u65b0\u3055\u308c\u305fRaspberry Pi OS\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044OS\u306b\u306f\u3001Firefox\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u7248\u306a\u3069\u3001Pi\u56fa\u6709\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u300264\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306f\u3001Wayland\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044OS\u306f\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u6642\u9593\u304c\u77ed\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5236\u9650\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 x86\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306eRaspberry Pi Desktop\u306b\u306f\u66f4\u65b0\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3001Pi 5\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u58f2\uff01\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305fOS\u3082\u540c\u68b1\uff01", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4OS\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30a2\u30f312 Bookworm\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\uff01", "Raspberry Pi\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044OS\u3067\u3042\u308bBookworm\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3068Wayland\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30bf\u30fc\u5c0e\u5165\uff01", "Wayland\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u4f53\u9a13\uff01", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4OS\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\uff01\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u6642\u9593\u304c\u77ed\u7e2e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u8d77\u52d5\u3082\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\uff01"]}

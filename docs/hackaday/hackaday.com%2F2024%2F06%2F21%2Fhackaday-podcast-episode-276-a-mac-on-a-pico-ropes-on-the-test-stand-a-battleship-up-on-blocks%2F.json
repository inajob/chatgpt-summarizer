The focus this week seemed to trend to old hardware, from the recently revived Voyager 1 to a 1940s car radio, a homebrew instrument from 1979, a paper tape reader, and a 128k Mac emulator built from an RP2040.\nNewer hacks include a 3D-printed bottle labeler, a very hackable smart ring, and lessons learned about programming robots. We also took a look at turning old cell phones into Linux machines, making sure climbing ropes dont let you down, and snooping on orbital junk with a cool new satellite.\nWe wrapped things up with a discussion of just how weird our solar system is, and Dan getting really jealous about Tom Nardis recent trip to see the battleship New Jersey from an up close and personal perspective.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nWorried about attracting the Black Helicopters?

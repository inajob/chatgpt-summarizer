The concept behind it is simple (though not easy), and the results can be striking when applied correctly.\n3D prints that really dont look 3D-printed.\nThe idea is this: colored, melted filament is, in a sense, not that different from colored paint. Both come in various colors, are applied in thin layers, and blend into new colors when they do so. When applied correctly, striking imagery can emerge. An example is shown here, but there are several more both on the HueForge project page as well as models on Printables.\nInstead of the 3D printer producing a 3D object, the printer creates a (mostly) flat image similar in structure to a lithophane. But unlike a lithophane, these blend colors in clever and effective ways by printing extremely thin layers in highly precise ways.\nDoing this effectively requires a software tool to plan the color changes and predict how the outcome will look. It all relies on the fact that even solid-color filaments are not actually completely opaque  not when printed at a layer height of 0.08 mm, anyway  and colors will, as a result, blend into one another when layered. Thats how a model like the one shown here can get away with only a few filament changes.\nOf course, this process is far from being completely automated. Good results require a solid amount of manual effort, and the transmissivity of ones particular filament choices plays a tremendous role in how colors will actually blend. Thats where the FilaScope comes in: a tool to more or less objectively measure how well (or how poorly) a given filament transmits light. The results plug into the HueForge software to better simulate results and plan filament changes.\n\n\n\n\nWhen done well, its possible to create things that look nothing at all like what we have come to expect 3D-printed things to look. The cameo proof-of-concept model is available here if youd like to try it for yourself, and theres also an Aztec-style carving that gives a convincing illusion of depth.\n[Horn  Rhode] point out that this concept is still searching for a right-sounding name. Front-lit lithophane? Reverse lithophane? Filament painting? Color-blended bas-relief? If you have a better idea, we urge you not to keep it to yourself because [Horn  Rhode] absolutely want to hear from you."}

With the upcoming remake by Cyan of Riven into a fully 3D experience, [deater] found themselves wondering how much of the original games click-and-puzzle game would fit on a 140 kB floppy for the Apple II series of computers. Since Myst was able to be squeezed\u00a0 onto a mere three floppies and provide a reasonably playable version of the game on the Apple II, surely the same could be done for this sequel?\nThe Maglev in the Apple II port of Riven. (Credit: [deater])Just a look at the system requirements for Riven (Win95+, 100 MHz Pentium, 16 MB RAM and 75 MB disk space) and the knowledge that the game came on five CD-ROMs (until the DVD release) should instill some trepidation that a serious demake would be needed. Ultimately [deater] managed to set the system requirements for the port to any Apple II with at least 48 kB of RAM. The same custom game engine as for the Myst port is used, with the original CG stills downsampled and the movies rotoscoped at fairly low framerate.\nAlthough the Disk 39 in the video is currently the sole floppy, containing part of Dome Island and the Maglev, it is probably a fair assessment of how many 140 kB disks would be needed to port the entire game. Even with the downsampled graphics, [deater] reckons it would take on the order of hundreds of floppies to fit the whole thing.\n\n", "title": "Apple II\u7528\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff1aRiven\u3092140 kB\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u308b", "body": "Riven\u306eApple II\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5143\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3069\u308c\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u308b\u304b\u691c\u8a0e\u304c\u7d9a\u304f\u3002CG\u306e\u7e2e\u5c0f\u3084\u52d5\u753b\u306e\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u4f4e\u4e0b\u306a\u3069\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u53ce\u3081\u308b\u306b\u306f\u6570\u767e\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u898b\u7a4d\u3082\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Apple II\u7528\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff1aRiven\u3092140 kB\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u308b", "Misty\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aRiven\u306eApple II\u7528\u30c7\u30de\u30ad\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba", "Apple II\u3067\u518d\u73fe\uff1fRiven\u304c3D\u4f53\u9a13\u306b\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af", "\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff06\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\uff1aApple II\u3078\u306eMyst\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "140 kB\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u3067\u518d\u73fe\uff1aRiven\u306eApple II\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

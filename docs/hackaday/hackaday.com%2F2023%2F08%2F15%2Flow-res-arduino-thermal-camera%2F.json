The box has beautiful pictures that probably came from the Hubble. What you will see is somewhat different. You have to carefully look at [upirs] Arduino thermal camera project because it intersperses pictures of what you expect an 88 sensor will produce with images produced by a much better camera.\nThe actual project  watch the video below  is undoubtedly neat. An inexpensive 88 IR sensor and an 8X8 LED panel join to form a crude but usable thermal camera.\n\nHe leverages several ready-made libraries and walks through how and why he chose them and how he had to modify them. We enjoyed the demo of plotting HSV values to the LED array instead of the usual RGB values.\nGiven canned code to read the sensor and drive the LEDs, the rest is easy. Of course, like the dime-store telescope, you arent going to get amazing results. On the other hand, you probably have everything you need except the $20 sensor sitting around doing nothing anyway.\nAt around the ten-minute mark, he shows the same sensor in a commercial module that interpolates a higher resolution to an LCD. Still crude, so he also gives a quick review of a commercial camera that plugs into your phone. (You can ignore the video from here on if the stealth advertising bugs you.) Weve actually looked at that camera before. Weve also looked at some of the competition. While any of those will beat the 88 Arduino camera, theyll cost more and wont give you the satisfaction of building it, either.\n"}

WHY has found itself making the news in the Dutch technical media for all the wrong reasons over the last few days, after serious concerns were raised about the fire safety of its badge.\nThis is the cell supplied with the WHY badge, complete with manufacturers warning.\nThe concerns were raised from the RevSpace hackerspace in Leidschendam, and centre around the design of the battery power traces on the PCB between the battery holders and the power supply circuitry. Because the 18650 cells supplied with that badge lack any protection circuitry, bridging the power traces could be a fire risk.\nIn short: their report names the cell holders as having tags too large for their pads on the PCB, a too-tight gap between positive and negative battery traces, protected only by soldermask, and the inadequacy of the badges short circuit protection. In the event that metal shorted these battery tags, or wore through the soldermask, the batteries would be effectively shorted, and traces or components could get dangerously hot.\nThe WHY organizers have responded with a printed disclaimer leaflet warning against misuse of the cells, and added a last-minute epoxy coating to the boards to offer additional protection. Some people are 3D-printing cases, which should also help reduce the risk of short-circuiting due to foreign metal objects. Using an external powerbank with short-circuit protection instead of the cells would solve the problem as well. Meanwhile a group of hackers collecting aid for Ukraine are accepting the batteries as donations.\nIts understood that sometimes bugs find their way into any project, and in that an event badge is no exception. In this particular case, the original Dutch badge team resigned en masse at the start of the year following a disagreement with the\u00a0 WHY2025 organizers, so this badge has been a particularly hurried production. (Editors note: the group that brought the 18650 concerns to light has some overlap with the group that left the WHY2025 badge project.) Either way, we are fortunate that the issue was spotted, and conference organizers took action before any regrettable incidents occurred.", "title": "- \u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u300cWHAT Hackers Yearn (WHY) 2025\u300d\u304c\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u3067\u958b\u50ac", "body": "\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u706b\u707d\u5b89\u5168\u304c\u61f8\u5ff5\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u8b1b\u3058\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u300cWHAT Hackers Yearn (WHY) 2025\u300d\u304c\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u3067\u958b\u50ac", "- WHY\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u706b\u707d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u61f8\u5ff5\u3068\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u554f\u984c", "- 18650\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30df\u30b9\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5371\u967a", "- WHY2025\u4e3b\u50ac\u8005\u304c\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u3092\u5f37\u5316", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304c\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u652f\u63f4\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u4ed8\u3051\u4e2d"]}

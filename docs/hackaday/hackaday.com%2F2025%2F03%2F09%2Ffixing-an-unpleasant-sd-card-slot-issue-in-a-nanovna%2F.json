Unfortunately theres a solid chance that especially small microSD cards will find their way past the microSD card reader slot and into the enclosure. This is what happened to [Rob] of the SevenFortyOne Radios and Repairs channel on YouTube with a NanoVNA unit. While shaking the unit, you can clearly hear the microSD card rattling inside, courtesy of the rather large gap above the card slot.\nAfter a quick teardown and extracting the lost microSD card, the solution to prevent this is a simple bit of foam stuck on top of the microSD card slot, so that the too large opening in the enclosure is now fully blocked. Its clearly a bit of a design fail in this particular NanoVNA unit, worsened by the tiny size of the card and having to use a fingernail to push the card into the slot as its so far inside the enclosure.\nWhile [Rob] seems to blame himself for this event, wed chalk it mostly up to poor design. Its an issue thats seen with certain SBC enclosures and various gadgets too, where losing a microSD card is pretty much a matter of time, and hugely fiddly at the best of times. That said, what is your preferred way of handling microSD card insertion  removal in devices like these?\n\n", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8131\u843d\u3092\u9632\u3050\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5bfe\u7b56", "body": "NanoVNA\u306emicroSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u843d\u4e0b\u3057\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u4e0d\u826f\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3068\u5224\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8131\u843d\u3092\u9632\u3050\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5bfe\u7b56", "- NanoVNA\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30df\u30b9\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6539\u826f\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3044\u306e\u30b3\u30c4"]}

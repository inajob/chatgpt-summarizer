If you have a 3D printer, you might wish you could just scan some kind of part and print it  sort of like a 3D photocopier. Every time we think about this, though, we watch a few videos and are instantly disappointed by the results, especially with cheap scanners. If you go the hardware route, even cheap is relative. However, you can  in theory  put an app on your phone to do the scanning. Some of the apps are free, and some have varying costs, but, again, it seems like a lot of work for an often poor result. So we were very interested in the video from [My 3D Print Lab] where he uses his phone and quite a few different apps and objectively compares them.\nUnsurprisingly, one of the most expensive packages that required a monthly or annual subscription created an excellent scan. He didnt print from it, though, because it would not let you download any models without a fee. The subject part was an ornate chess piece, and the program seems to have captured it nicely. He removed the background and turntable he was using with no problems.\nOther apps didnt fare as well, either missing some of the parts or failing to omit background elements. You may have to do some post-processing. Some of the other expensive options have free trials or other limits, but you can at least try them for free. One of the free trials let you do three free scans, but each scan took about 8 hours to process.\n\nThere are some free options, too, and while they arent great, most of the paid ones arent very good either. The apps tested are: Widar, Polycam, xOne, RealityScan, MagiScan, Qlone, Kiri Engine, and MakerWorld AI Scanner. Not all of these would provide a free download, but for the ones that did, he tried to print the resulting model from each. Qlone didnt work on Android, so it didnt get tested either.\nOf the phone apps, Kiri Engine looks like the best. However, he also shows MakerWorld AI Scanner, a Web app that converts videos. It had a few minor issues, but it did a great job and looks like something that might be fun to try, especially since it is free. They also have a tool on that same website that has a limited number of uses per month that claims it can create a 3D model from a single photograph (and not just an extrusion of the flat image). Theres some science behind that.\nIf you just want the results, you can skip to about 14:50 to learn the reasoning behind the top three picks in each evaluation category. We know sometimes it is just as easy to design a part as scan it. Weve used one of those cheap turntable scanners before, but they have gotten somewhat better recently.\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30673D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3: \u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7269\u3092\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u9ad8\u984d\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3084\u7121\u6599\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306f\u307e\u3061\u307e\u3061\u3002\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306f\u7121\u6599\u3067\u8a66\u305b\u308b\u304c\u3001\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b\u3002Kiri Engine\u3068MakerWorld AI Scanner\u304c\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30673D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3: \u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea: \u7d50\u679c\u306e\u8a55\u4fa1\u3068\u8ab2\u984c\u306e\u6982\u8981", "\u9ad8\u30b3\u30b9\u30c83D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea: \u512a\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea: \u7121\u6599\u3067\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308bKiri Engine\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aWeb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea: MakerWorld AI Scanner\u306e3D\u5909\u63db\u6280\u8853\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

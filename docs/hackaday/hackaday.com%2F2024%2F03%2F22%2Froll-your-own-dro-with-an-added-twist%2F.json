Thats why modern machines typically have some form of digital read-out (DRO). [Stefano Bertelli] has created a simple Raspberry Pi based DRO with an additional twist, that of a linked motor drive output.\nRealtime encoder position reading and motor control are best done with a dedicated microcontroller, ideally with a proper RTOS.\nThe axes that need to be monitored should be mechanically attached to a position sensor like a linear encoder or a rotary type. Using a linear sensor with a linear axis instead of a rotary encoder on the downstream dial is better. For the readout unit, [Stefano] used a WaveShare 7-inch touchscreen module with a Raspberry Pi 3 for the UI of the readout unit. The Pi has a custom-designed HAT, that performs power conditioning and provides a robust RS485 interface. Connected via that RS485 link is another custom PCB based on an STM32F411 with a few supporting power supplies and interfacing components. The job of this board is to interface to the position encoders, reading positioning pulses using interrupts. There is an additional stepper motor drive courtesy of a ULN2003 Darlington driver to allow the control of a single motorised axis. An additional motor driver module is required, which should be no surprise since driving a milling machine axis will require a fairly beefy motor. This GitHub repo contains the FreeRTOS-based firmware for this board. This motor drive has the ability to be connected to a measuring axis in a programmable way, enabling one axis to be adjusted to follow or jump in controlled steps with another. This feature can significantly simplify certain types of machining operations, as [Stefano] elaborates in the video.\nLastly, the Raspberry Pi runs a simple Python application with Kivy for the GUI. As [Stefano] explains in the video below, this makes debugging and modification quite simple.\nAdding DROs to an older machine is an obvious but valuable hack. Heres another way to do it. If thats too much work, then you could just hack a digital readout calliper in there.\n\n\nThanks to [paulvdh] for the tip!", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306aDRO\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u65e7\u578b\u6a5f\u68b0\u306bDRO\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002[Stefano Bertelli]\u304cRaspberry Pi\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDRO\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u306f\u5c02\u7528\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u6700\u9069\u3002\u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u4f7f\u7528\u3002Python\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3068Kivy\u3067GUI\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306aDRO\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eDRO\u3068\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30de\u30b7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306bDRO\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "Python\u3068Kivy\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fRaspberry Pi\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fGUI\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u958b\u767a"]}

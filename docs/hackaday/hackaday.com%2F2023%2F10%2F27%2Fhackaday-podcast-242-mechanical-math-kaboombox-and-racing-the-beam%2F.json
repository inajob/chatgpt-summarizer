Well, we liked these one, anyway.\nFirst up in the news, its finally time for Supercon! So well see you there? If not, be sure to check out the talks as we live-stream them on our YouTube channel!\nDont forget  this is your last weekend to enter the 2023 Halloween Hackfest contest, which runs until 9 AM PDT on October 31st. Arduino are joining the fun this year and are offering some spooky treats in addition to the $150 DigiKey gift cards for the top three entrants.\nIts time for a new Whats That Sound, and Kristina was able to stump Elliot with this one. Shell have to think of some more weirdo sounds, it seems.\nThen its on to the hacks, beginning with an insanely complex mechanical central air data computer super-teardown from [Ken Shirriff]. We also learned that you can 3D-print springs and things by using a rod as your bed, and we learned whole lot about rolling your own electrolytic capacitors from someone who got to visit a factory.\nFrom there we take a look at a Commodore Datassette drive that sings barbershop, customizing printf, and a really cool dress made of Polymer-dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) panels. Finally we talk about racing the beam when it comes to game graphics, and say goodbye to Kristinas series on USPS technology.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 242 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2023 Hackaday Superconference\n2023 Halloween Contest on Hackaday\n\nHasbro Kids Proton Pack Conversion\n\n\nFront 242: Back Catalog\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out the form, place yer bets!

Just as you think you\u2019ve seen it all, for instance, alnwlsn comes along and mills the DIP-package ATtiny84 and embeds a complete Simon game in the space normally wasted by all that plastic overmolding. It\u2019s the tiniest, and most gonzo, circuit-sculpture Simon we\u2019ve ever seen.\nNow, our judges are hard at work ranking all 80 of the entries, and we have a fantastic range of entries all around, so I\u2019m not calling any winners yet. But have you ever seen a project milled into a chip before? Nope, me neither.\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that this happens every time we run a contest. The second you put limitations on a project, there\u2019s always someone out there who says \u201cHold my beer\u201d and blows the limits out of the water. Indeed, the frequency with which we see someone pull off the impossible on Hackaday makes me wish I were buying more lottery tickets. You all really are stupendous.\nWe hope that feats like this are as inspirational to you as they are to us. No idea is too bonkers to not at least give it a try. Who knows, it might work! And when it does, please write it up and let us know. Keep the cycle of inspiration going!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

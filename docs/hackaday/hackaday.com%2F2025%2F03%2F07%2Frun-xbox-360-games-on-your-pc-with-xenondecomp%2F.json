Based around the triple-core IBM CPU codenamed Xenon, the Xbox 360 was released in 2005 and generally quite successful over its lifespan despite its Red Ring of Death issues. Although the current Xbox Series X supports running a number of Xbox 360 games, this is done via emulation and only 632 games out of 2,155 are supported.\nThis is where XenonRecomp not only promises turning the games into native (x86) software, but also allowing for a range of graphical improvements. Best of all, it allows for Xbox 360 games to be preserved instead of linked to an obsolete console. That said, much like with N64Recomp, its not a simple matter of running a tool over the PPC binary. Youre expected to have in-depth systems knowledge, with the tools in XenonRecomp assisting with the decompilation (into C++) and the recompilation into x86 binaries, but support for PPC instructions, VMX (vector instructions) and aspects like jump table conversion and (currently missing) MMIO support are likely to present an enterprising developer with hours of fun to implement and debug when issues arise.\n\nAfter recompilation into an x86 binary, the required assets are then expected to be copied in from a (legal) copy of the original game. As a proof of concept the game\u00a0Sonic Unleashed has been ported in this manner, with [Modern Vintage Gamer] running through this port and the improvements made over the original game, as well as some issues you may encounter:\n", "title": "- Xbox 360\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u300cXenonRecomp\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "XenonRecomp\u306fXbox 360\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092x86\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3057\u3001\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- Xbox 360\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u300cXenonRecomp\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u67a0\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\uff01Xbox 360\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4fdd\u5b58\u3068\u9032\u5316", "- N64\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305fXenonRecomp\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- Xbox 360\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u300cSonic Unleashed\u300d\u3092\u4f8b\u306b\u898b\u308bXenonRecomp\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3068\u8ab2\u984c"]}

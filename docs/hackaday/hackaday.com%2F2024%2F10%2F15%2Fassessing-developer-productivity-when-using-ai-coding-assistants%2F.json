According to a recent report by code analysis firm Uplevel there are no significant benefits, while GitHub Copilot also introduced 41% more bugs. Commentary from development teams suggests that while the coding assistant makes for faster writing of code, debugging or maintaining the code is often not realistic.\nNone of this should be a surprise, of course, as this mirrors what we already found when covering this topic back in 2021. With GitHub Copilot and kin being effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained on codebases, they are best considered to be massive autocomplete systems targeting code. Much like with autocomplete on e.g. a smartphone, the experience is often jarring and full of errors. Perhaps the most fair assessment of GitHub Copilot is that it can be helpful when writing repetitive, braindead code that requires very little understanding of the code to get right, while its bound to helpfully carry in a bundle of sticks and a dead rodent like an overly enthusiastic dog when all you wanted was for it to grab that spanner.\nUntil Copilot and kin develop actual intelligence, it would seem that software developer jobs are still perfectly safe from being taken over by our robotic overlords.", "title": "GitHub Copilot: AI\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u73fe\u72b6", "body": "GitHub Copilot\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u5e83\u544a\u3084\u30d1\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u3082\u591a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3089\u306f2021\u5e74\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u3066\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u3069\u308c\u3060\u3051\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u5831\u544a\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5229\u70b9\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306a\u304f\u3001GitHub Copilot\u306f\u30d0\u30b0\u3082\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d20\u65e9\u3044\u8a18\u8ff0\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u304c\u3001\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u3084\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u73fe\u5b9f\u7684\u3067\u306a\u3044\u3068\u958b\u767a\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["GitHub Copilot: AI\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u73fe\u72b6", "GitHub Copilot: \u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u3068\u8ab2\u984c", "GitHub Copilot: \u30d0\u30b0\u767a\u751f\u7387\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u52b9\u7387", "GitHub Copilot: \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u52a9\u624b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u6027", "GitHub Copilot: \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

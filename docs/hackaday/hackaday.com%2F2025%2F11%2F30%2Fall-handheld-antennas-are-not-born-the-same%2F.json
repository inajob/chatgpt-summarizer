These flexible rubber-coated antennas are a compromise in performance, being significantly smaller than a wavelength at their frequency of operation. [OM40ET] has an interesting video in which he investigates this\u00a0by tearing down a cheap rubber duck antenna and an even cheaper fake.\nThese antennas usually have a flexible upper section and a bulge at the bottom over the connector. The fake one has nothing in the bulge except the antenna wire and thus has a very high SWR, while the real one has a loading coil. This coil is an interesting design, because its designed such that the antenna has two resonant points at the 2 metre and 70 centimetre amateur bands. On paper its a tapped coil fed at the tap through a capacitor for matching, but a more detailed appraisal will tell you that the two halves of the coil are designed to return those two resonances. Its still a not-very-good antenna, but the fact that it works at all is something.\nIf you want something better at VHF and havent got much space, all is not lost. We recently featured a VHF magnetic loop.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u6790\u300d", "body": "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4ed8\u5c5e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u771f\u8d0b\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3084\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u6790\u300d", "- \u300c\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b4\u30e0\u88fd\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03\u3068\u771f\u5b9f\u300d", "- \u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u88cf\u5074: \u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u5206\u6790\u300d", "- \u300cVHF\u7528\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6642\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u9078\u3073\u300d", "- \u300c\u771f\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3068\u507d\u7269\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d"]}

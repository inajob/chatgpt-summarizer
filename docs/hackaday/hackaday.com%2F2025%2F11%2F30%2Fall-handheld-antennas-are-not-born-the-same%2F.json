These flexible rubber-coated antennas are a compromise in performance, being significantly smaller than a wavelength at their frequency of operation. [OM40ET] has an interesting video in which he investigates this\u00a0by tearing down a cheap rubber duck antenna and an even cheaper fake.\nThese antennas usually have a flexible upper section and a bulge at the bottom over the connector. The fake one has nothing in the bulge except the antenna wire and thus has a very high SWR, while the real one has a loading coil. This coil is an interesting design, because its designed such that the antenna has two resonant points at the 2 metre and 70 centimetre amateur bands. On paper its a tapped coil fed at the tap through a capacitor for matching, but a more detailed appraisal will tell you that the two halves of the coil are designed to return those two resonances. Its still a not-very-good antenna, but the fact that it works at all is something.\nIf you want something better at VHF and havent got much space, all is not lost. We recently featured a VHF magnetic loop.\n\n"}

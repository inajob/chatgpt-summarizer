Lovely flashing LEDs can only improve the aesthetic, so if thats what youre after, you might consider the ARCCore board from [NatalieTheNerd].\nThe board is a compact and easy way to drive some addressable LEDs, with a form factor designed to take up a small amount of space when stuffed into a Game Boy or other game console. It rocks an RP2040 microcontroller set up to drive a strip of WS2812B LEDs. Three buttons are used to configure the color and brightness settings. The board is designed to run on 3.3 to 5 V, thanks to an onboard buck converter. Its capable of delivering enough juice to run up to 10 RGB LEDs, though you could potentially use more if you ran them from external power.\nYou can use just about any microcontroller on the market today to run addressable LEDs if you so desire. If you want a compact drop-in solution that takes up less space, though, you might find the ARCCore useful. If youve got your own nifty kit for running addressable LEDs, dont hesitate to share it with the broader hacker massive  hit the tipsline!"}

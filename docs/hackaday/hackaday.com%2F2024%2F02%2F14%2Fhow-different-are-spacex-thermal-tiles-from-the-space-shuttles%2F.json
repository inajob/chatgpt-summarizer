(Credit: Breaking Taps, YouTube)\nYet how similar are they really? Thats what the [Breaking Taps] channel on YouTube sought to find out, using an eBay-purchased chunk of Shuttle thermal tile along with bits of Starship tiles that washed ashore following the explosive end to the vehicles first integrated test last year.\nTo answer the basic question: the SpaceX engineers responsible for the Starship thermal tiles seem to have done their homework. An analysis of not only the structure of the fibrous material, but also the black IR-blocking coating, shows that the Starship tiles are highly reminiscent of the EATB (introduced in 1996) tiles with TUFI (toughened unipiece fibrous insulation) coatings with added molybdenum disilicide, which were used during the last years of the Shuttle program.\nTUFI is less fragile than the older RCG (reaction cured glass) coating, but also heavier, which is why few TUFI tiles were used on the Shuttles due to weight concerns. An oddity with the Starship tiles is that they incorporate many very large fibers, which could be by design, or indicative of something else.\n\nMaking your own pure silica thermal tiles with glass coating is exciting, but not that easy. (Credit: Breaking Taps, YouTube)\nDetails of these specific coatings and tile compositions for Shuttle missions can be found in this NASA presentation. Using spectral analysis on the tile fragments, the materials in each sample were analyzed, with molybdenum being clearly present in the Starship tile sample; although its hard to tell whether its at the same ratio as that NASA used it. The fibrous material making up the bulk of the tile showed the presence of silica, alumina-borosilicate and aluminium oxide, consistent with AETB. This strongly suggests that the Starship thermal tiles are based on the research done during the Shuttle program, which probably shouldnt come as a shock to anyone.\nAs for making your own thermal tiles, this too is attempted in the video, with decent results. To make the most basic type of thermal tile, as used during the early years of the Shuttle program, all you need is silica fiber, colloidal silica, an appropriate oven, borosilicate glass, acid, and a few more ingredients along with another pass through the oven to get an HRSI (100% silica) base tile with RCG coating.\nWhat this however shows is that although you can make your own thermal tiles with a half-decent lab setup, perfecting the process is indeed a decades-long process, as seen with the Space Shuttles.\n"}

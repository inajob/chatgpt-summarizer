In fact, it all stemmed from coming across a miniscule half-inch 6432 OLED display module that was simply too slick to pass up.\nUSB connector for charging on the bottom, hole for distance sensor out the top.\nTo use it, one simply powers it on and the display will read out the distance in millimeters. The VL53L0X time-of-flight sensor inside works by sending out a laser pulse and measuring how long it takes for the pulse to bounce back. We hope youre curious about what such a sensor looks like on the inside, because heres a nifty teardown of these fantastic devices. The device can technically measure distances of up to 2 m, but [gokux] says accuracy drops off after 1 m.\nThe main components besides the OLED display and VL53L0X sensor are an ESP32-C3 board (which handily integrates battery charging circuitry), 3D-printed enclosure, tiny rechargeable battery, and power switch. The whole thing is under one cubic inch. Not bad, and it even makes a passable keychain. Parts list, code, and 3D model files, including STEP format, are all available if youd like to spend an afternoon making your own.", "title": "\u8d85\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044LiDAR\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "[gokux]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8d85\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLiDAR\u6e2c\u8ddd\u5668\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u3084\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u90e8\u54c1\u3078\u306e\u611f\u8b1d\u306e\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001VL53L0X\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306a\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u8d85\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044LiDAR\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30df\u30ea\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u3067\u8ddd\u96e2\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u5c0f\u578bLiDAR\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306aLiDAR\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "ESP32-C3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fLiDAR\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "1\u7acb\u65b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u672a\u6e80\u306eLiDAR\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5236\u4f5c"]}

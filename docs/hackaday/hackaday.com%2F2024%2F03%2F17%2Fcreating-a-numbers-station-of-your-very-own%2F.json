If youve ever wanted to build one of your own, you could follow the example of [AudioWanderer].\nNumberMumble, as its called, is a numbers station emulator. It doesnt signal spy networks or reveal national secrets. Instead, it randomly plays audio samples using an Arduino, including characteristic bursts of white noise that make it sound more authentic. It relies on the Mozzi library to help with audio tasks, including generating white noise and playing back samples. Its also kitted out with a filter knob for varying the tone. Audio output is via PWM.\nIf you want to confuse your neighbours with oddball audio, put this thing on a radio transmitter and get broadcasting. But dont, because thats illegal without the proper licenses or  you know  if you happen to be a real spy. Video after the break.\n\n"}

Much of the requisite mathematics is introduced, along with a long list of links to further reading. The whole solution is based entirely on free and open source (FOSS) software, in fact a giant stack of such software including planning and simulation software on top of glue like MQTT message queues.\nThe practical exercise for this installment was to have the arm trace out the shape of a heart, given as a mathematical equation expressed in Python code, and it fared quite well. Measurements were taken! Science was done!\nWe last brought you word about this project in October of 2024. Since then, the project name has changed from ManiPilator to ManiPylator. Originally the name was a reference to the Raspberry Pi, but now the focus is on the Python programming language. But all the bots best friends just call him Manny.\nIf you want to get started with your own 6DOF robotic arm, [Leo] has traced out a path for you to follow. Wed love to hear about what you come up with!\n\n"}

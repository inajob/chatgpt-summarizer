With a single user you can make do with remote terminals or by simply plugging and unplugging, but with multiple users its not so easy.\nCNX Softwares [Jean-Luc Aufranc] had just such a problem involving broken keyboards and a forgotten wireless dongle, but fortunately he had just reviewed the latest version of the Raspberry Pi 500 all-in-one computer with the fancy mechanical switches. His keyboard solution is inspired but completely overkill: to use the full power of the compact Linux machine to emulate a Bluetooth keyboard.\nAt the heart of this hack is btferret, a Bluetooth library. Run the appropriate software on your Pi, and straight away youll have a Bluetooth keyboard. It seems theres a bit of keymap tomfoolery to be had, and hitting the escape key terminates the program  we would be caught by that SO many times!  but its one of those simple hacks it pays to know about in case like him you need to get out of a hole and happen to have one of the range of Pi all-in-one machines to hand.", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fBluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u969b\u3001Raspberry Pi 500\u3067Bluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fBluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- \u8907\u6570\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u30d0\u30b0\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4ee3\u66ff\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u6280\u8853", "- btferret\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3067\u7c21\u5358Bluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5316", "- Pi\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

The average person isnt exactly clamoring for a DOS machine these days, but they attracted quite a bit of interest among the retrocomputing scene. Now the dust has settled, [The Retro Shack] has taken a Book 8088 and given it an honest review. Do you need portable 1980s computing in your life, and if so it this the machine to give you it?\nThe first impression of the machine is just how svelte it is, being like a small but chunky netbook. He explores the hardware and finds as expected an NEC V20 instead of the Intel part running the show, and what would have been a hugely expanded DOS PC back in the day with its VGA and sound card, not to mention a solid state hard drive.\nWere overcome with a bit of nostalgia here at the sight of DOS running Lemmings, and on a machine wed have given anything to own back in the 1980s. His final conclusion is that its a very nice little PC but around $160 seems a little much for what is essentially a toy. We have sadly to agree with him though we really want one, though noting that such a machine would have retailed for a huge amount more than that in 1980s dollars and wed have considered it a huge bargain then.\nIf youre still curious, we covered the arrival of these machines last year.\n\n", "title": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a386sx\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d1\u30eb\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30688088\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "\u6628\u5e74\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u304b\u3089\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u4e00\u3064\u306f386sx\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3001\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u3064\u306f8088\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u9593\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u9762\u3067\u7591\u554f\u8996\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a386sx\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d1\u30eb\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30688088\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u597d\u304d\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff1aBook 8088\u306e\u6b63\u76f4\u306a\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eDOS\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "NEC V20\u642d\u8f09\uff1aBook 8088\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u63a2\u7d22", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u5922\u4e2d\uff1aBook 8088\u3067\u904a\u3076nostalgia"]}

But they continue to hold a fascination in our community, both when used for their original purpose, and as objects for hardware hacking in their own right. After their first few years when they were a rare and exclusive gadget, they were manufactured in such huge numbers as to be readily available for the curious hacker. [Suikan] has taken one of these plentiful models and done something special for it, creating a new mainboard, and a firmware which transforms it into a reverse Polish, or RPN, scientific calculator.\nThe Sharp EL210 and EL215 were ubiquitous early-1980s calculators without scientific functions, and with a VFD display. We remember them being common during our schooldays, and they and similar models can still be found on a trawl through thrift stores.\nOn the board is one of the STM32 microcontrollers and a Maxim VFD driver, and fitting it is simply a case of soldering the Sharps VFD to it, placing it in the calculator, and attaching the keyboard. The firmware meanwhile uses the orange C key from the original calculator as a function key, alternating between standard and scientific operations.\nIf youre curious about RPN, weve taken a look at it here in the past.", "title": "1.\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\uff1aRPN\u79d1\u5b66\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u53e4\u304f\u611f\u3058\u308b\u96fb\u5353\u3082\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u3068\u3057\u3066\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002Sharp EL210\u3084EL215\u3068\u3044\u304680\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306e\u96fb\u5353\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u9006\u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u8a18\u6cd5(RPN)\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u96fb\u5353\u306b\u5909\u3048\u305f\u4f8b\u3002STM32\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068Maxim VFD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["1.\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\uff1aRPN\u79d1\u5b66\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "2.\u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u308b\uff1a\u73cd\u3057\u3044EL210\u3068EL215\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u300d", "3.\u300c\u7269\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u6280\u8853\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u96fb\u5353\u3092DIY\u300d", "4.\u300c\u5b9a\u756aVFD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u8a08\u753b\u300d", "5.\u300c\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1aSTM32\u3068Maxim\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d"]}

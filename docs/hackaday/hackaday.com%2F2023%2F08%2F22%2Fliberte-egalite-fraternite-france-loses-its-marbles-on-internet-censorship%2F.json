Were sure that most of our readers will understand the implications of this, but for anyone not versed in online privacy and censorship\u00a0 this is a level of intrusion not even attempted by China in its state surveillance programme. Perhaps most surprisingly in a European country whose people have an often-fractious relationship with their government, very few French citizens seem to be aware of it or what it means.\nIts likely that if they push this law through it will cause significant consternation over the rest of the European continent. Wed expect those European countries with less liberty-focused governments to enthusiastically jump on the bandwagon, and wed also expect the European hacker community to respond with a plethora of ways for their French cousins to evade the snooping eyes of Paris. We have little confidence in the wisdom of the EU parliament in Brussels when it comes to ill-thought-out laws though, so we hope this doesnt portend a future dark day for all Europeans. We find it very sad to see in any case, because France on the whole isnt that kind of place.\nHeader image: Pierre Blach\u00e9 CC0."}

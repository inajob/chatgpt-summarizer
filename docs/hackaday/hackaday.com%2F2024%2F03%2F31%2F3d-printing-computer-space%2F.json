Nolan Bushnel and Ted Dabneys 1971 Computer Space was a flowing fiberglass cabinet containing a version of the minicomputer game Spacewar! running on dedicated game hardware. The pair would of course go on to found the wildly successful Atari, leaving their first outing with its meager 1500 units almost a footnote in their history.\nUnsurprisingly with so relatively few produced, few made it out of the United States, so in the UK there are none to be found. [Arcade Archive] report on a fresh build of a Computer Space cabinet, this time not in fiberglass but via 3D printed plastic.\nThe build itself is the work of [Richard Horne], and in the video he takes us through the design process before printing the parts and then sticking them all together to make the cabinet. Without a real machine to scan or measure hes working from photographs of real machines, working out dimensions by reference to other cabinets such as PONG that appear alongside them. The result is about as faithful a model of the cabinet as could be made, and its cut into the many pieces required for 3D printing before careful assembly.\nThis is the first in a series, so keep following them to see a complete and working Computer Space take shape.\n\n", "title": "1971\u5e74\u306e\u521d\u306e\u5546\u696d\u7528\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e\u5fa9\u5143", "body": "1971\u5e74\u306bNolan Bushnell\u3068Ted Dabney\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u30012024\u5e74\u3067\u306f\u7a00\u306a\u5b58\u5728\u3067\u30011500\u53f0\u3057\u304b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u56de\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u518d\u88fd\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1971\u5e74\u306e\u521d\u306e\u5546\u696d\u7528\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e\u5fa9\u5143", "\u30ec\u30a2\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8c61\u5fb4\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "Atari\u5275\u696d\u8005\u306b\u3088\u308b\u521d\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u304b\u30893D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u307e\u3067\u3001\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "ARCADE ARCHIVE\u304cComputer Space\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u88fd\u4f5c\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

This also mostly depended on what home computer you could get your hands on, which was a market that  at least in Japan  Nintendo was very happy to slide into with their Nintendo Family Computer, or Famicom for short. With the available peripherals, including a tape deck and keyboard, you could actually create a fairly decent home computer, as demonstrated by [Throaty Mumbo] in a recent video.\n\nAfter a lengthy unboxing of the new-in-box components, we move on to the highlight of the show, the HVC-007 Family BASIC package, which includes a cartridge and the keyboard. The latter of these connects to the Famicoms expansion port. Inside the package, you also find a big Family BASIC manual that includes sprites and code to copy. Of course, everything is in Japanese, so [Throaty] had to wrestle his way through the translations.\nThe cassette tape is used to save applications, with the BASIC package also including a tape with the Sample 3 application, which is used in the video to demonstrate loading software from tape on the Famicom. Although [Throaty] unfortunately didnt sit down to type over the code for the sample listings in the manual, it does provide an interesting glimpse at the all-Nintendo family computer that the rest of the world never got to enjoy.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001Famicom\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u74b0\u5883\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- HVC-007 \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fcBASIC\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u4fdd\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5", "- [Throaty Mumbo]\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u63a2\u7d22"]}

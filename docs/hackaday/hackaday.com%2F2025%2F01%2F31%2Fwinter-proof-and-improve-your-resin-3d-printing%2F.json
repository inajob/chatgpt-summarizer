With colder temperatures comes an overall surge in print failure reports  particularly with resin-based printers that might reside in outbuildings, basements, or garages. If you think this applies to you, dont miss [Jan Mr\u00e1zek]s tips on improving cold-weather print results. His tips target the main reasons prints fail, helping to make the process a little more resilient overall. [Jan]s advice is the product of long experience and experimentation, so dont miss out.\nWith environmental changes comes the possibility that things change just enough to interfere with layers forming properly. The most beneficial thing overall is to maintain a consistent resin temperature; between 22 and 30 degrees Celsius is optimal. A resin heater is one solution, and there are many DIY options using simple parts. Some of the newer (and more expensive) printers have heaters built in, but most existing hobbyist machines do not.\nAn extreme case of blooming.\nTemperature control isnt the only thing, either. Layer formation and build plate adhesion can all be improved by adding rest times between layers. Yes, this increases print time. It also allows resin to settle before the next layer, improving adhesion and preventing blooming (a rough texture caused by an imperfect cure.) Since resin flows less readily at lower temperatures, rest times can help improve results. The best setting depends heavily on your particular setup, so [Jan] gives tips on finding optimal rest times.\nMost common knowledge and advice from well-meaning communities online focuses on increasing exposure time or blaming the build plate. [Jan] feels that these are ultimately the wrong way to go about addressing failures. Usually, an environmental change (like the arrival of winter) has simply pushed a printer that was not optimized in the first place outside of its narrow comfort zone. A little optimization can set things back on track, making the printer more resilient and reliable overall.", "title": "\u51ac\u5b63\u5370\u5237\u306e\u5931\u6557\u3092\u9632\u3050\uff1a\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u6cd5", "body": "\u51ac\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5370\u5237\u5931\u6557\u304c\u5897\u52a0\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u3084\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u304c\u6539\u5584\u7b56\u3002", "titles": ["\u51ac\u5b63\u5370\u5237\u306e\u5931\u6557\u3092\u9632\u3050\uff1a\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3057\u30663D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a", "\u5c64\u5f62\u6210\u3092\u6539\u5584\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u4f11\u61a9\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u74b0\u5883\u5909\u5316\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u5931\u6557\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\uff01\u51ac\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6210\u529f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

[The Baiko] has given us a rather abstract entry that looks like a planeif you squint at it under the right conditions.\nIts actually quite an amusing abstract build. If youve ever seen planes flying in the night sky, youve probably noticed they all have similar lights. Navigation lights, or position lights as they are known, consist of a red light on the left side and a green light on the right side. [The Baiko] assembled two such LEDs on a small sliver of glass along with an ATtiny85 microcontroller.\nPowered by a coin cell, they effectively create a abstract representation of a plane in the night sky, paired with a flashing strobe that meets the requirements of the contest. [The Baiko] isnt exactly sure of the total power draw, but notes it must be low given the circuit has run for weeks on a 30 mAh coin cell.\nIts an amusing piece of PCB art, though from at least one angle, it does appear the red LED might be on the wrong side to meet FAA regulations. Speculate on that in the comments.\nIn any case, weve had a few flashers submitted to the competition thus far, and youve got until August 19 to get your own entry in!\n \n\n\n"}

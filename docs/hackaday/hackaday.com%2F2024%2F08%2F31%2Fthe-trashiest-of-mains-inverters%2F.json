But still, there might be moments when a mains supply is needed and youre not lucky enough to have AliExpress at your fingertips, and for that, heres [Rulof] with a mains inverter that is simultaneously awful and awesome. Hes made a rotary converter, from trash and off the shelf parts.\nWhile a switch-mode converter operates using PWM at many times the output frequency for efficiency, were guessing that most readers will be familiar enough with how AC works to see how a low frequency converter turns DC into AC. A set of switches repeatedly flip the polarity, and the resulting square wave is fed into a transformer to step up to the final voltage. The switches can be mechanical as with old-style converters that used vibrating reeds or rotary armatures, or they can be electronic using power transistors. In this case they are a set of microswitches actuated by a set of cams on a shaft driven by a small motor, and the transformer comes from a surplus UPS.\nWere guessing that the frequency will be only a few Hz and the microswitches will suffer from switching such an inductive load, but as you can see in the video below the break it does light a mains bulb, and were guessing it would be enough to activate most wall-wart switching power supplies. Were not so sure though about his use of the IEC sockets from the UPS to carry 12 volts, as the current may be a little much for them.\nMeanwhile if you thirst for more of this kind of thing, we have you covered.\n\n"}

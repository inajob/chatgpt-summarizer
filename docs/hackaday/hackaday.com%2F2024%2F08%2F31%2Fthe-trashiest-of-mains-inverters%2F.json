But still, there might be moments when a mains supply is needed and youre not lucky enough to have AliExpress at your fingertips, and for that, heres [Rulof] with a mains inverter that is simultaneously awful and awesome. Hes made a rotary converter, from trash and off the shelf parts.\nWhile a switch-mode converter operates using PWM at many times the output frequency for efficiency, were guessing that most readers will be familiar enough with how AC works to see how a low frequency converter turns DC into AC. A set of switches repeatedly flip the polarity, and the resulting square wave is fed into a transformer to step up to the final voltage. The switches can be mechanical as with old-style converters that used vibrating reeds or rotary armatures, or they can be electronic using power transistors. In this case they are a set of microswitches actuated by a set of cams on a shaft driven by a small motor, and the transformer comes from a surplus UPS.\nWere guessing that the frequency will be only a few Hz and the microswitches will suffer from switching such an inductive load, but as you can see in the video below the break it does light a mains bulb, and were guessing it would be enough to activate most wall-wart switching power supplies. Were not so sure though about his use of the IEC sockets from the UPS to carry 12 volts, as the current may be a little much for them.\nMeanwhile if you thirst for more of this kind of thing, we have you covered.\n\n", "title": "\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Switch-mode\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u4f4e\u3044DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u96fb\u5727\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u96fb\u6e90\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u9762\u3067AliExpress\u304c\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[Rulof]\u304c\u3001\u30b4\u30df\u3084\u5e02\u8ca9\u90e8\u54c1\u304b\u3089\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "DC\u3092AC\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u6368\u3066\u3089\u308c\u305fUPS\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u5909\u63db\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

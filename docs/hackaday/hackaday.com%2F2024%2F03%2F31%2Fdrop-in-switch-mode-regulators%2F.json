Besides simplicity, they have the additional advantage of not being particularly noisy, but with a major caveat: they are terribly inefficient. To solve this problem a switching regulator can be used instead, but that generally increases complexity and noise. With careful design, though, a switching regulator can be constructed to almost completely replicate a linear regulator like this drop-in TO3 replacement. (Google Translate from German)\nWhile the replacement regulator was built by [Mr. Floppy], the units are being put to the test in the linked video below by [root42]. The major problem these solve compared to other switching regulators is the suppression of ripple, which is a high-frequency artifact that appears on the DC voltage. Reducing ripple in this situation involved designing low-inductance circuit traces on the PCB as well as implementing a number of EMI filters on both input and output. The final result is an efficient voltage supply for retrocomputers which has a ripple lower than their oscilloscopes can measure without special tools.\n[root42] is not only testing these, but the linked video also has him using the modules to repair a Commodore 1541 which originally had the linear TO3 voltage regulators. Its definitely a non-trivial task to build a switching power supply that meets the requirements of sensitive electronics like these. Switch mode power supplies arent new ideas, either, and surprisingly pre-date the first commercially-available transistor although modern ones like these are much less expensive to build.\n\n", "title": "DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "body": "DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u6700\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u5727\u5206\u5727\u5668\u3084Zener\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u304c\u975e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u3001\u307b\u307c\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u7dda\u5f62\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u3001\u8907\u96d1\u6027\u3068\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u5897\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u578b\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306e\u4f4e\u6e1b\u3068\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5727\u4f9b\u7d66", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u6027", "\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30b8\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5229\u7528", "\u6545\u969c\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb1541\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u96fb\u6e90\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb"]}

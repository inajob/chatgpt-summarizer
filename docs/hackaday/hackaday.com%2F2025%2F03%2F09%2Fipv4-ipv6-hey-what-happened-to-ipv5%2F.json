Well, thanks to [Navek], you dont have to wonder anymore. Just watch the video below.\nWe will warn you of two things. First, the video takes a long time to get around to what IPv5 was. In addition, if you keep reading, there will be spoilers.\n\nThe first part of the video covers the general differences between IPv4 and IPv6, especially surrounding addressing. Then, it talks about how IP alone cant do things you like to do for handling things like voice. For example, the IP layer doesnt understand how much bandwidth exists between two points. It is only concerned with moving data from one point to another point.\nTo foster voice communications, there was a proposal for something called the stream protocol. It didnt catch on. In fact, it was reincarnated as a proposal to move video, too, but it still didnt catch on. However, the network header used the next number in sequence, which was five!\nSo, really, the video title is a bit of a red herring. You didnt forget IPv5; there simply was never an IPv5. There is, however, network protocol #5, which has little to do with IP and never caught on.\nStill, an interesting walk down memory lane to a time when moving voice and video over the network was exotic high-tech. We love diving into the old network stuff like finger and UUCP.\n", "title": "- IPv5\u306f\u5b9f\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\uff1f\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "body": "IPv5\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u305b\u305a\u3001\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb#5\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- IPv5\u306f\u5b9f\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\uff1f\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "- IPv4\u3068IPv6\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u77e5\u308d\u3046", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb#5\u306e\u8b0e\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "- \u6614\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u6280\u8853\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\u65c5"]}

Still, when musician [Peter Pringle] put out a video detailing how he replicated an ancient Sumerian instrument, we couldnt wait to dig in.\nThe instrument in question is the Golden Lyre of Ur, and it was buried at the Royal Cemetery of Ur with a passel of other grave goods (including a Silver Lyre) something around 4400 to 4500 years ago. For those not in the know, Ur was an early Sumerian city in the part of Mesopotamia became modern-day Iraq. A lyre is a type of plucked stringed instrument, similar to a harp.\nThat anything of the instrument remains after literal millennia buried under the Mesopotamian sand is thanks to the\nThis representation was unearthed in the same dig as the remains of the Golden Lyre and its silver sister.\nextensive ornamentation on the original lyre the gut strings and wooden body might have rotted away, but the precious stones and metals adorning the lyre preserved the outline of the instrument until it was excavated in 1922. Reconstruction was also greatly aided by contemporary mosaics and pottery showing similar lyres.\nFor particular interest are the tuning pegs, which required that artistic inspiration to recreate the original archeological dig did not find any evidence of the tuning mechanism. [Peter] spends some time justifying his reconstruction, using both practical engineering concerns (the need for tension to get good sound) and the pictographic evidence. The wide buzzing bridge matches the pictographic evidence as well, and gives the lyre a distinct, almost otherworldly sound to Western ears. [Peter]s reconstruction sounds good, though we have no way of knowing if it matches what youd have heard in the royal halls of Ur all those dusty centuries ago. (Skip to 17:38 in the video below if you just want to hear it in action.)\nThe closest thing to this ancient, man-sized lyre weve seen on Hackaday before might be one of the various laser harp projects weve featured over the years. If you squint a little, you can see the distant echo of the Golden Lyre of Ur in at least some of them. We also cant help but note that the buzzing bridge gives the Sumerian lyre a certain droning quality not entirely unlike a hurdy-gurdy, because we apparently cant have a musical post without mentioning the hurdy-gurdy.\n\n", "title": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u697d\u5668\u300c\u30a6\u30eb\u306e\u91d1\u306e\u30ea\u30e9\u300d\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u5bb6\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u97f3\u697d\u5bb6\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u304c\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u91d1\u306e\u30ea\u30e9\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3002\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u7684\u8a3c\u62e0\u3092\u5143\u306b\u97f3\u8272\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u4ee3\u697d\u5668\u300c\u30a6\u30eb\u306e\u91d1\u306e\u30ea\u30e9\u300d\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u5bb6\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u30e1\u30bd\u30dd\u30bf\u30df\u30a2\u306e\u907a\u7269\uff1a4500\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u91d1\u306e\u30ea\u30e9\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "\u53e4\u4ee3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u697d\u5668\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u3089\u305b\u308b", "\u30ea\u30e9\u306e\u97f3\u8272\u304c\u97ff\u304f\uff1a\u30a6\u30eb\u306e\u91d1\u306e\u30ea\u30e9\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u3068\u97f3\u697d\u7684\u63a2\u6c42", "\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u53e4\u4ee3\u697d\u5668\u518d\u73fe\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

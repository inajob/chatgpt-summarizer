While adding significant tolerance between parts is an option, often you want to have a friction fit or at least a gap that you cannot drive a truck through. In a video by [Slant 3D] a number of tips and tricks to improve parts design with tolerance in mind are provided.\nStarting with the fairly obvious, such as avoiding sharp corners, rounding off edges and using chamfered edges\u00a0 and filets for e.g. lids to make getting started easy, the video then moves into more advanced topics. Material shrinkage is a concern, which is where using thin walls instead of solid blocks of material helps, as does using an appropriate infill type. Another interesting idea is to use a compliant mechanism in the lid to get a friction fit without getting all print parameters just right.\nOn the opposing side to the lid  or equivalent part  youd follow many of the same tips, with the addition of e.g. slots that allow for the part to flex somewhat. All of this helps to deal with any variability between prints, with the suggested grip fins at the end of the video being probably the most extreme.\n\n", "title": "FDM\u5370\u5237\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30c8\u30ec\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "FDM\u5370\u5237\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u9069\u5408\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3084\u3001\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3002", "titles": ["FDM\u5370\u5237\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30c8\u30ec\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "\u6750\u6599\u53ce\u7e2e\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u8584\u58c1\u3068\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u9078\u629e", "\u30d5\u30ea\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u6a5f\u69cb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u5370\u5237\u306e\u3070\u3089\u3064\u304d\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u96c6"]}

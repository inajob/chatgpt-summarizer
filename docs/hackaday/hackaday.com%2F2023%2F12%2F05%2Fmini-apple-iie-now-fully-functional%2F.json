[James Lewis] has given us another with his fully functional Apple IIe from the Mega II chip.\nWhen we last checked in on the\u00a0Mega IIe, it was only just booting and had a ways to go before being a fully functional Apple II. We really love the modular dev board he designed to do the extensive debugging required to make this whole thing work. Each of the boards is connected with jumper pins, which [Lewis] admits would have been better as edge connectors since he shouldve known hed be unplugging and replugging them more than hed like.\n\nThis modular prototyping system paid dividends late in the project when a MEGA bug threatened the stability of the entire system. Since it was confined to the keyboard PCB, [Lewis] was able to correct the error and, swapping for the third revision of the board, everything that had been crashing the system now ran.\nThere were still some issues going to the final unified PCB that nearly made him give up on the project, but perseverance paid off in the end. Combining vintage chips and multiple RP2040s isnt for the feint of heart.\nNow that you have a more conveniently-sized Apple II, why not teach it some new tricks like digital photography or ChatGPT?\n\n\n"}

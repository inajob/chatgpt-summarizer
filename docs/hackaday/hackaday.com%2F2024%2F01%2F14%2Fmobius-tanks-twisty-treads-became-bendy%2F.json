We saw how [James] showed it could be done, and he demonstrated smart design and assembly techniques in the process.\nHes since modified the design to a single-track, and added a flex point in the center of the body. Two linear actuators work together to make the vehicle bend, and therefore give it the ability to steer and turn. A normal tread would be unable to bend in this way, but the twist in the M\u00f6bius tread accommodates this pivot point perfectly well.\nIt works, but its not exactly an ideal vehicle. With the tread doing a 90-degree twist on the bottom, there isnt a lot of ground clearance. In addition, since the long vehicle has only a single tread, it is much taller than it is wide. Neither does it any real favors when it comes to stability over uneven terrain, but its sure neat to try.\nEven if its not practical, M\u00f6bius Tank is wild to look at.

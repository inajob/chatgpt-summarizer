You can make something very big, or something very small. [DIY GUY Chris] has done the latter, producing a tiny LED cube that he says is the worlds smallest.\nAs is so often the way, the build relies on tiny WS2812B-compatible LEDs in a 1 mm x 1 mm form factor. Theyre mounted on a series of teeny interlocking PCBs that come together to build a cube thats just 8 cubic centimeters in volume. Power is courtesy of a small lithium-ion cell that lives inside the cube. Data and power signals flow around the cube via solder connections along the edges of the faces of the cube.\u00a0 Running the show is an ATmega328P, the same microcontroller youd find in an Arduino Uno. Its responsible for sending out commands to the LEDs to create various animations.\nWe cant speak to [Chriss] claim about being the worlds smallest, but it is small. Weve seen other builds in a similar vein, like this barely-larger D20 with a full 2400 LEDs, though. Video after the break.\n\n"}

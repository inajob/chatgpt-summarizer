We have an uncommon skill with hot metal and can manipulate the tiniest of parts, and incidentally our chopstick skills arent that bad as a consequence, either.\nBut even the best with a soldering iron can find useful tips from an expert, and thats where [Mr SolderFix] comes in. His channel is chock-full of soldering advice, and in his latest video he takes a look at tweezers. Theyre a part of the solderers standard kit and we all have several pairs, but its fair to say that we dont always have the right pair to hand.\nIt was refreshing to hear him confirm that a good pair of tweezers, once a certain quality threshold has been met, need not necessarily be the most expensive set. Weve certainly seen expensive tweezers with suspiciously bendy ends, and have found random AliExpress purchases which have stood the test of time. He also makes the point about which situations a set of tweezers with serrated heads might be more useful, and he demonstrates with a crystal oscillator.\nAs with photography though, wed observe that sometimes the best set of tweezers to rectify a mishap are the ones in your hand. If youre interested in more from [Mr SolderFix], weve featured his work more than once in the past. When he showed us how to lift SMD pins, for example.", "title": "\u300cMr SolderFix\u300d\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u643a\u308f\u308b\u8005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3001\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306f\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u52d5\u753b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u300cMr SolderFix\u300d\u3067\u306f\u3088\u308a\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u826f\u8cea\u3067\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u5341\u5206\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u304c\u5f37\u8abf\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cMr SolderFix\u300d\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "", "\u5927\u4e8b\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831", "", "\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u304c\u6559\u3048\u308b\u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "", "\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306b\u91cd\u8981\uff1f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "", "\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u5931\u6557\u3092\u4fee\u6b63\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8: \u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

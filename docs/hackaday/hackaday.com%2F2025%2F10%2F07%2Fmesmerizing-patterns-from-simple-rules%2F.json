Who has time for that insanity!?!? [Bleuje] provides the perfect solution with his mesmerizing display of particle behavior.\n\nAgents follow defined paths created by other agents.\nThese patterns of color and structure, based on 36 points, are formed from simple particles, also called agents. Each agent leaves behind a trail that adds to the pattern formation. Additionally, these trails act almost as pheromone trails, attracting other particles. This dispersion and attraction to trails create the feedback loops similar to those found in ant herd behavior or slime mold.\n\nComplex patterns created by the algorithm can resemble many different biological formations including slime mold.\nOf course, none of this behavior would be very fun to mess with if you couldn\u2019t change the parameters on the fly. This is one main feature of [Bleuje]\u2019s implementation of the 36 points\u2019 ideas. Being able to change settings quickly and interact with the environment itself allows for touching natural feeling patterns without exiting your house!\nIf you want to try out the simulation yourself, make sure to check out [Bleuje]\u2019s GitHub repository of the project! While getting out of the house can be difficult, sometimes it\u2019s good for you to see real natural patterns. For a great example of this hard work leading to great discoveries, look to this bio-inspired way of protecting boat hauls!\nThanks Adrian for the tip!", "title": "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u7f8e\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7c92\u5b50\u884c\u52d5\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u7f8e\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7c92\u5b50\u884c\u52d5\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- 36\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u751f\u547d\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u6a21\u69d8", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- GitHub\u3067\u8a66\u305b\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300cBleuje\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

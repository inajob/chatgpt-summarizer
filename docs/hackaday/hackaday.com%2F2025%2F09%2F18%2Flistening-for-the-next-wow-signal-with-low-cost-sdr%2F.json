While doing research into the legendary \u201cWow! Signal\u201d detected back in 1977, they realized that the burst was so strong that a small DIY radio telescope would be able to pick it up using modern software-defined radio (SDR) technology.\nThis realization gave birth to the Wow@Home project, an effort to document both the hardware and software necessary to pick up a Wow! class signal from your own backyard. The University reasons that if they can get a bunch of volunteers to build and operate these radio telescopes, the resulting data could help identify the source of the Wow! Signal  which they believe could be the result of some rare astrophysical event and not the product of Little Green Men.\nUltimately, this isnt much different from many of the SDR-based homebrew radio telescopes weve covered over the years  get a dish, hook your RTL-SDR up to it, add in the appropriate filters and amplifiers, and point it to the sky. Technically, youre now a radio astronomer. Congratulations. In this case, you dont even have to figure out how to motorize your dish, as they recommend just pointing the antenna at a fixed position and let the rotation of the Earth to the work  a similar trick to how the legendary Arecibo Observatory itself worked.\n\nThe tricky part is collecting and analyzing whats coming out of the receiver, and thats where the team at Arecibo hope to make the most headway with their Wow@Home software. It also sounds like thats where the work still needs to be done. The goal is to have a finished product in Python that can be deployed on the Raspberry Pi, which as an added bonus will generate a live preview of the data in the style of the original Ohio State SETI project printouts. Sounds cool to us.\nIf youre interested in lending a hand, the team says theyre open to contributions from the community  specifically from those with experience RFI shielding, software GUIs, and general software development. We love seeing citizen science, so hopefully this project finds the assistance and the community it needs to flourish.\nThanks to [Mark Stevens] for the tip.", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578bDIY\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3067\u300cWow!

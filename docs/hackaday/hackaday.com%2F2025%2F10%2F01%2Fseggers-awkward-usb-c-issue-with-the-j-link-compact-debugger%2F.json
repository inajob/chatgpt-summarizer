With the gory details covered by [Alvaro], the latest to join the party is Segger, with its J-Link BASE Compact MCU debugger displaying the same behavior which we saw back when the Raspberry Pi 4 was released in 2019. Back then so-called e-marked USB-C cables failed to power the SBC, much like how this particular J-Link unit refuses to power up when connected using one of those special USB-C cables.\nWe covered the issue in great detail back then, discussing how the CC1 and CC1 connections need to be wired up correctly with appropriate resistors in order for the USB-C supply  like a host PC  to provide power to the device. As [Alvaro] discovered through some investigation, this unit made basically the same mistake as the RPi 4B SBC before the corrected design. This involves wiring CC1 and CC2 together and as a result seeing the same 1 kOhm resistance on the active CC line, meaning that to the host device you just hooked up a USB-C audio dongle, which obviously shouldnt be supplied with power.\nAlthough its not easy to tell when this particular J-Link device was produced, the PCB notes its revision as v12.1, so presumably its not the first rodeo for this general design, and the product page already shows a different label than for the device that [Alvaro] has. Its possible that it originally was sloppily converted from a previous micro-USB-powered design where CC lines do not exist and things Just Work, but its still a pretty major oversight from what should be a reputable brand selling a device that costs \u20ac400 + VAT, rather than a reputable brand selling a $100 SBC.\nFor any in the audience who have one of these USB-C-powered debuggers, does yours work with e-marked cables, and what is the revision and/or purchase date?", "title": "- USB-C\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\uff1aJ-Link BASE Compact MCU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u554f\u984c", "body": "USB-C\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u518d\u767a\u3001J-Link\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u304c\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u306b\u5931\u6557\u3002", "titles": ["- USB-C\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\uff1aJ-Link BASE Compact MCU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u554f\u984c", "- Raspberry Pi 4\u3068\u540c\u69d8\u306eUSB-C\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u5931\u6557\uff1aSegger\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- e-marked USB-C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u7f60\u3068\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u8aa4\u52d5\u4f5c", "- CC\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1aJ-Link\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30df\u30b9\u3092\u691c\u8a3c", "- USB-C\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6559\u8a13\uff1aSegger\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b"]}

With the gory details covered by [Alvaro], the latest to join the party is Segger, with its J-Link BASE Compact MCU debugger displaying the same behavior which we saw back when the Raspberry Pi 4 was released in 2019. Back then so-called e-marked USB-C cables failed to power the SBC, much like how this particular J-Link unit refuses to power up when connected using one of those special USB-C cables.\nWe covered the issue in great detail back then, discussing how the CC1 and CC1 connections need to be wired up correctly with appropriate resistors in order for the USB-C supply  like a host PC  to provide power to the device. As [Alvaro] discovered through some investigation, this unit made basically the same mistake as the RPi 4B SBC before the corrected design. This involves wiring CC1 and CC2 together and as a result seeing the same 1 kOhm resistance on the active CC line, meaning that to the host device you just hooked up a USB-C audio dongle, which obviously shouldnt be supplied with power.\nAlthough its not easy to tell when this particular J-Link device was produced, the PCB notes its revision as v12.1, so presumably its not the first rodeo for this general design, and the product page already shows a different label than for the device that [Alvaro] has. Its possible that it originally was sloppily converted from a previous micro-USB-powered design where CC lines do not exist and things Just Work, but its still a pretty major oversight from what should be a reputable brand selling a device that costs \u20ac400 + VAT, rather than a reputable brand selling a $100 SBC.\nFor any in the audience who have one of these USB-C-powered debuggers, does yours work with e-marked cables, and what is the revision and/or purchase date?"}

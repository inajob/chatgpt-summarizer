You can stop doubting yourself once and for all after youve watched the Tech 101: Antennas webinar by [Dr. Jonathan Chisum].\n[Jonathan] breaks it all down in a way that makes you want to rip out your old antenna and start fresh. It goes further than textbook theory; its the kind of knowledge defense techs use for real electronic warfare. And since its out there in bite-sized chunks, we hackers can easily put it to good use.\nThe key takeaway is that antenna size matters. Basically, it\u2019s all about wavelength, and [Jonathan] hammers home how tuning antenna dimensions to your target frequency makes or breaks your signal. Whether youre into omnis (for example, for 360-degree drone control) or laser-focused directional antennas for secret backyard links, this is juicy stuff.\nIf youre serious about getting into RF hacking, watch this webinar. Then dig up that Yagi build, and be sure to send us your best antenna hacks.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d3\u30ca\u30fc", "body": "Yagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3084WiFi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d3\u30ca\u30fc\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u54c1\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d3\u30ca\u30fc", "- \u96e8\u306e\u65e5\u3067\u3082\u5b89\u5fc3\uff01WiFi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u91cd\u8981\uff01\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316", "- 360\u5ea6\u5236\u5fa1\u304b\u3089\u79d8\u5bc6\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u307e\u3067\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- RF\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u96c6"]}

However, what is not quite as easy is retrieving a piece of whatever you\u2019re viewing. This is exactly what researchers from HIT Shenzhen have attempted to solve with their magnetic capsule bot.\nWhen traditional procedures want to take a sample somewhere in the intestinal tract they generally require somewhat invasive procedures sticking something up\u2026well you know. With this pill, robot magnetic control allows physicians to choose exactly where and when to take a sample, all without shoving unpleasant objects into\u2026again you know.\nA magnetic field is generated to open the capsule and suck liquids inside. This traps a sample that can be retrieved through later bowel movements. The technology hasnt been tested on a living patient yet, but but animal trials are planned for the foreseeable future.\nCheck out the fine details with the paper itself here.\u00a0Biomedical engineering is always an interesting topic with so much potential for more hacking. We at Hackaday are no strangers to this wonderful world of bodily hacks."}

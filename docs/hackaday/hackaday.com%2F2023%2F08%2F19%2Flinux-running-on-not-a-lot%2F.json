Thats not the whole story though, because there are microcontroller-focused variants of the kernel which dont require an MMU, including one for the Xtensa cores found on many Espressif chips. Its this that [Naveen] is using to produce a computer which may not be the Linux computer with the lowest processor power, but could be the one consuming the least electrical power.\nThe result is definitely not a Linux powerhouse, but with its Arduino-sourced ESP32 board stacked on an UNO and I2C keyboard and display, its an extremely lightweight device. The question remains, though, is it more than a curiosity, and to what can it do? The chief advantage it has over its competitors such as the Raspberry Pi Zero comes in low power consumption, but can its cut-down Linux offer as much as a full-fat version? We are guessing that some commenters below will know the answer.\nIf youre curious about the Xtensa version of Linux, it can be found here,"}

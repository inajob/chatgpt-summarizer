(Credit: Will Prowse)\nBecause size matters when it comes to statistics, [Will Prowse] decided to not just bank on his handful of failed Battle Born LFP batteries when it came to documenting their failure modes. Instead he got a whole gaggle of them from a viewer\u00a0who had experienced failures with their Battle Born LFP batteries for an autopsy, adding a total of 15 samples to the data set.\nInterestingly, the symptoms of these dead batteries are all over the place, from a refusal to charge, some have the overheating terminal, some do not show any sign of life, others have charged cells but a non-responsive BMS, etc. As [Will] notes, its important to test batteries with a load and a charger to determine whether they are functional not just whether you can measure a charge.\nAlthough some of the batteries still showed enough signs of life to be put aside for some load testing, the remaining ones were cut open to check their insides. This revealed the typical molten plastic at the terminals, but also a lot of very loose connections for the internal wiring. Another battery showed signs of corrosion inside, which could be due to either moisture intrusion or a cell having leaked its electrolyte.\nWhile the full results will hopefully be released soon, the worrying thing about this latest batch of Battle Born LFP batteries is that they span quite a few years, with one being from 2018. Although its comforting that not every one of these batteries is necessarily going to catch on fire within its approximate 8-year lifespan, a lot seems to depend on exactly how you load and charge them, as [Will] is trying to figure out with the upcoming load testing. With the unit that he recently purchased for testing it turned out that lower currents actually made the melting problem much worse.\nBetween this video and the much awaited follow-up, [Will] actually got his hands on a troubled 300A-rated industrial Battle Born battery. During testing that one actually failed violently with a cell venting and the loose BMS rattling around in the case.\n\n", "title": "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5931\u6557\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\uff01Battle Born LFP\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb15\u500b", "body": "Will Prowse\u306f15\u500b\u306eBattle Born LFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5206\u6790\u3057\u3001\u6545\u969c\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u8abf\u67fb\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u4e0d\u826f\u3084\u8150\u98df\u306e\u5146\u5019\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5931\u6557\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\uff01Battle Born LFP\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb15\u500b", "\u51b7\u9759\u306b\u898b\u3064\u3081\u308bBattle Born LFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u75c7\u72b6\u3068\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u6eb6\u878d\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u4e0d\u826f\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "Battle Born LFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u52a3\u5316\uff1a\u5e74\u6570\u3068\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5f71\u97ff", "300A\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff1a\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u306a\u5931\u6557\u306e\u5b9f\u9332"]}

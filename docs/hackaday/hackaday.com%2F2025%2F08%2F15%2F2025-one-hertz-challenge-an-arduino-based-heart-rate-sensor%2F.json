Its a tough question to answer, because our heart rate changes all the time depending on what were doing and how our body is behaving. However, [Ludwin] noted that resting heart rates often settle somewhere near 60 bpm on average. Thus, they entered a heart rate sensor to our 2025 One Hertz Challenge!\nThe build is based around a Wemos D1 mini, a ESP8266 development board. Its hooked up to a MAX30102 heart beat sensor, which uses pulse oximetry to determine heart rate with a photosensor and LEDs. Basically, its possible to determine the oxygenation of blood by measuring its absorbance of red and infrared wavelengths, usually done by passing light through a finger. Meanwhile, by measuring the change in absorption of light in the finger as blood flows with the beat of the heat, its also possible to measure a persons pulse rate.\nThe Wemos D1 takes the reading from the MAX30102, and displays it on a small OLED display. It reports heart rate in both beats per minute and in Hertz. if you can happen to get your heartrate to exactly 60 beats per minute, it will be beating at precisely 1 Hertz. Perhaps, then, its the person\u00a0using Ludwins build that is actually eligible for the One Hertz Challenge, since theyre the one doing something once per second?\nIn any case, it shows just how easy it is to pick up biometric data these days. You only need a capable microcontroller and some off-the-shelf sensors, and youre up and running.\n\n\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u5fc3\u62cd\u6570\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\uff01Wemos D1 mini\u3068MAX30102\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u5fc3\u62cd\u6570\u306f\u6d3b\u52d5\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5909\u5316\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u9759\u6642\u306f\u7d0460 bpm\u3002Wemos D1 mini\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5fc3\u62cd\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5fc3\u62cd\u6570\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\uff01Wemos D1 mini\u3068MAX30102\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u4f11\u606f\u6642\u306e\u5fc3\u62cd\u6570\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u751f\u4f53\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u53d6\u5f97\uff01\u5fc3\u62cd\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- 60 bpm\u3067\u306e\u8108\u62cd\u8a08\u6e2c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01One Hertz Challenge\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- ESP8266\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5fc3\u62cd\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac"]}

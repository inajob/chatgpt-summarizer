Ever wanted to use a high-level but powerful scripting language on it? Thanks to [Oliver] we now have a MicroPython application for the Flipper, complete with a library for hardware and software feature support. Load it up, start it up, connect over USB, and youve got the ever-so-convenient REPL at your disposal. Or, upload a Python script to your Flipper and run them directly from Flippers UI at your convenience!\nIn the API docs, were seeing support for every single primitive you could want  GPIO (including the headers at the top, of course), a healthy library for LCD and LCD backlight control, button handling, SD card support, speaker library for producing tones, ADC and PWM, vibromotor, logging, and even infrared transmit/receive support. Hopefully, we get support for Flippers wireless capabilities at some point, too!\nCheck out the code examples, get the latest release from the Flipper app portal or GitHub, load it up, and play! Mp-flipper has existed for the better half of a year now, so its a pretty mature application, and it adds quite a bit to Flippers use cases in our world of hardware hacking.

They were fragile and expensive, and their performance was not very high. The transistor which brought the devices to a mass audience through the 1950s and 1960s was the one which followed, the alloy diffusion type. [Play With Junk] has a failed OC71 PNP alloy diffusion transistor, first introduced in 1957, and has cracked it open for a closer look.\nInside the glass tube is a small wafer of germanium crystal, surrounded by silicone grease. It forms the N-type base of the device, with the collector and emitter being small indium beads fused into the germanium. The junctions were formed by the resulting region of germanium/indium alloy. The outside of the tube is pained black because the device is light-sensitive, indeed a version of this transistor without the paint was sold as the OCP71 phototransistor.\nThese devices were leaky and noisy, with a low maximum frequency and low gain. But they were reliable and eventually affordable, so some of us even cut our electronic teeth on them.\n\n", "title": "\u521d\u671f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306f\u58ca\u308c\u3084\u3059\u304f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u4f4e\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5408\u91d1\u62e1\u6563\u578b\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "titles": ["\u521d\u671f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9032\u5316", "\u30a2\u30ed\u30a4\u62e1\u6563\u578b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "OC71\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u958b\u5c01\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3068\u767a\u898b", "\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4ium\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a6\u30e0\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u6027\u3068\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u6280\u8853", "\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u3068\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

They were in a weird space: computerized, but not really what you could call a computer, even in those days. More like a fancy typewriter, with a screen and floppy disks.\u00a0Brother made some very nice ones, and [Chad Boughton] got his hands on one for a modernization project.\nThe word processor in question, a Brother WP-2200, was chosen primarily because of its beautiful widescreen, yellow-phosphor CRT display. Yes, you read that correctly  yellow phosphor, not amber. Widescreen CRTs are rare enough, but thats just different. As built, the WP-2200 had a luggable form-factor, with a floppy drive, \u0336m\u0336e\u0336c\u0336h\u0336a\u0336n\u0336i\u0336c\u0336a\u0336l\u0336 clacky keyboard, and dot-matrix printer in the back.\nThanks to [Chad]s upgrade, most of that doesnt work anymore. Not yet, anyway. The original logic controller of this word processor was rather limited. As generations have hackers have discovered, you just cant do very much with these. [Chad] thus decided to tear it all out, and replace it with an ESP-32, since the ESP32-VGA library is a thing. Of course this CRT is not a VGA display, but it was just a matter of tracing the pinout and guesstimating sane values for h-sync, v-sync and the like. (Details are not given in the video.)\nRight now, the excellent mechanical keyboard (mostly) works, thanks to a Teensy reading the keyboard matrix off the original cable. The teensy sends characters via UART to the ESP32 and it can indeed display them upon the screen. Thats half of what this thing could do, back in the 1980s, and a very good start. Considering [Chad] now has magnitudes more compute power available than the engineers at Brother ever did (probably more compute power than the workstation used to program the WP2200, now that we think of it) were excited to see where this goes. By the spitballing at the end of the video, this device will end its life as much more than a word processor.To see what hes got working so far, jump to 5:30 in the video. Once the project is a bit more mature, [Chad] assures us hell be releasing both code and documentation in written form.\nWeve seen [Chad]s work before, most recently his slim-fit CD player, but he has been hacking for a long time.We covered his Super Mario PLC hack back in 2014.\n"}

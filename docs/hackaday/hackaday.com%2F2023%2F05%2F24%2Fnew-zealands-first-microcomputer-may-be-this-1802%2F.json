[Als Geek Lab] has an interview with [Hugh Anderson], who saw the articles and eventually designed the HUG1802, which may be the first microcontroller kit designed and sold in New Zealand.\nThe 1802 was very attractive at the time since it was inexpensive, static, didnt require exotic voltages, and had a DMA system that allowed you to load software without complex ROMs. He initially marketed a kit unsuccessfully until an Australian company convinced him to create a proper PC board  the resulting kit was sold to about 100 customers.\nThe HUG1802 reminded us somewhat of the Quest Super Elf since it had a keypad, a cassette interface, and even a TV output. The 1802 had a DMA-enabled chip that made crude memory-mapped video output. The computer eventually morphed into the ETI 660, which they talk about at the end of the interview.\nA lot of people built 1802 computers back in those days. If you dont have an 1802, but you have an Arduino ell, theres always emulation.\n\n"}

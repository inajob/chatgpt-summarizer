Making a directional speaker to project sound over a long distance is considerably more difficult than making one similar to your home speaker, and [Orange_Murker] is here with a solution. At the recent Hacker Hotel conference in the Netherlands, she presented an ultrasonic parametric speaker. It projects an extremely narrow beam of sound over a significant distance, but its not an audio frequency speaker at all.\nThose of you familiar with radio will recognize its operation; an ultrasonic carrier is modulated with the audio to be projected, and the speaker transfers that to the air. Just like the diode detector in an old AM radio, air is a nonlinear medium, and it performs a demodulation of the ultrasound to produce an audio frequency that can be heard. She spends a while going into modulation schemes, before revealing that she drove her speaker with a 40 kHz PWM via an H bridge. The speaker itself is an array of in-phase ultrasonic transducers, and she demonstrates the result on her audience.\nThis project is surprisingly simple, should you wish to have a go yourself. Theres a video below the break, and shes put all the files in a GitHub repository. Meanwhile this isnt the first time weve seen a project like this.\n\n", "title": "\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2\u97f3\u58f0\u6295\u5f71", "body": "\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u3067\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u305f\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u72ed\u3044\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u6295\u5f71\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2\u97f3\u58f0\u6295\u5f71", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u8a66\u305b\u308b\uff01\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u97f3\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5f62\u6210\u3059\u308b\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u97f3\u58f0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u5fdc\u7528", "Hacker Hotel\u3067\u306e\u767a\u8868\uff1a\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

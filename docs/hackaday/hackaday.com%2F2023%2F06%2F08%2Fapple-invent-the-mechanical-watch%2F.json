Where some see little more than e-waste others see an opportunity, as has [NanoRobotGeek] with this mechanical watch conversion on a first-generation model.\nWhat makes this build so special is its attention to detail. Into the Apple Watchcase has gone a Seiko movement, but it hasnt merely been dropped into place. It uses the original Apple watch stem which is offset, so hes had to create a linkage and a tiny pulley system to transfer the forces from one to the other. The rotor is custom-machined with am Apple logo, and the new watch face is a piece of laser-cut and heat treated zirconium. Even the watch movement itself needed a small modification to weaken the stem spring and allow the linkage to operate it.\nThe build is a long one with many steps, and were being honest when we say it would put our meager tiny machining skills to an extreme test. Sit down and take your time reading it, it really is a treat. Apple Watches may head to the tip after five years, but not this one!\nSee more in the video below the break, and of course long-time readers may remember weve considered the Apple Watch versus mechanical watches before.\n\n", "title": "Apple Watch\u3092\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u5909\u63db", "body": "Apple Watch\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3001\u30bb\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u306e\u30e0\u30fc\u30d6\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u50be\u659c\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30ea\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u5909\u3048\u305f\u3002\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u79c0\u9038\u3067\u30015\u5e74\u3067\u5ec3\u68c4\u3055\u308c\u308bApple Watch\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3053\u308c\u306f\u9055\u3046\u3068\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Apple Watch\u3092\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u5909\u63db", "\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30c7\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u3053\u3060\u308f\u3063\u305fApple Watch\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u30bb\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u306e\u30e0\u30fc\u30d6\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fApple Watch\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u71b1\u51e6\u7406\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b8\u30eb\u30b3\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308bApple Watch\u6539\u9020", "\u4f55\u5e74\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308bApple Watch\u306e\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

Sorting LEGO. You know what is fun? Making a machine to sort LEGO! Thats what [LegoSpencer] did, and you can watch the machine do its thing in the video below.\n[Spencer] runs us through the process: first, quit your day job so you can get a job playing with LEGO; then research what previous work has been done in this area (plenty, it turns out); and then commit to making your own version both reproducible and extensible.\nA sorting machine needs three main features: a feeder to dispense one piece at a time, a classifier to decide the type of piece, and a distributor to route the piece to a bin. Of course, the devil is in the details.\n\nIf you want to build your own, you might want to track the new Sorter V2 that is under development. If you are building V1, you can find what you need on GitHub.\nOnce youve got your LEGO sorted, youre free to take on other projects such as Building A Drivable, Life-Size 3D-Printed LEGO Technic Buggy, Making Steam-Powered LEGO Machines, and Building The DVD Logo Screensaver With LEGO.\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u4ed5\u5206\u3051\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u4ed5\u5206\u3051\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305fSpencer\u306e\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u4ed5\u5206\u3051\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "- \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u6574\u7406\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30ec\u30b4\u30bd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u8ffd\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "- GitHub\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u30ec\u30b4\u4ed5\u5206\u3051\u6a5f\u306e\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u6574\u7406\u3057\u305f\u3089\u3001\u6b21\u306f\u3069\u3093\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\uff1f"]}

[MeraByte] walks us through the possibly ridiculous task of installing Windows 95 on the last hardware anyone at Microsoft would ever endorse in a video you can watch below.\nObviously, the MIPS-based Emotion Engine at the heart of the PS2 is not going to be able to handle x86 instructions Win95 is expecting, but thats all solved by the magic of emulation. [MeraByte] is running a version of Bochs, an x86 emulator that has been built for PS/2 after trying and failing to install Windows (both 3.1 and 95) to an experimental DOSBox build.\nAs expected, it is not a smooth journey for [MeraByte], but the flailing about and troubleshooting make for entertaining viewing. Once loaded, it works surprisingly well, in that anything works at all. Unfortunately, neither the mouse nor Ultimate Doom 95 worked. We suppose that ultimately means that this hack fails since even Doom can run Doom. The mouse thing is also important, probably.\nIf you have a PlayStation 2, maybe skip Windows 95 and try running GoLang. \u00a0If you do have DOOM running on the PlayStation 2, send us a tip. There was never an official release for PS2, but after 26 years, someone must have done it by now.\n", "title": "- PS2\u3067Windows 95\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "body": "PS2\u306bWindows 95\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u304c\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- PS2\u3067Windows 95\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- MIPS\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u642d\u8f09\u306ePS2\u3067\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6311\u6226", "- Windows 95\u3092PS2\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u8ffd\u3063\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u89e3\u8aac", "- PS2\u3067\u306eDOOM\u52d5\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u3080\u3082\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3067\u5931\u6557", "- PlayStation 2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

Its a cool bit of applied physics, but there are other ways to sense magnetic fields, including leveraging the weird world of quantum physics with this diamond, laser, and microwave open-source sensor.\nHaving never heard of quantum sensors before, we took the plunge and read up on the topic using some of the material provided by [Mark C] and his colleagues at Quantum Village. The gist of it seems to be that certain lab-grown diamonds can be manufactured with impurities such as nitrogen, which disrupt the normally very orderly lattice of carbon atoms and create a nitrogen vacancy, small pockets within the diamond with extra electrons. Shining a green laser on N-V diamonds can stimulate those electrons to jump up to higher energy states, releasing red light when they return to the ground state. Turning this into a sensor involves sweeping the N-V diamond with microwave energy in the presence of a magnetic field, which modifies which spin states of the electrons and hence how much red light is emitted.\nBuilding a practical version of this quantum sensor isnt as difficult as it sounds. The trickiest part seems to be building the diamond assembly, which has the N-V diamond  about the size of a grain of sand and actually not that expensive  potted in clear epoxy along with a loop of copper wire for the microwave antenna, a photodiode, and a small fleck of red filter material. The electronics primarily consist of an ADF4531 phase-locked loop RF signal generator and a 40-dB RF amplifier to generate the microwave signals, a green laser diode module, and an ESP32 dev board.\nAll the design files and firmware have been open-sourced, and everything about the build seems quite approachable. The write-up emphasizes Quantum Villages desire to make this quantum technologys Apple II moment, which we heartily endorse. Weve seen N-V sensors detailed before, but this project might make it easier to play with quantum physics at home.", "title": "- \u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91cf\u5b50\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u91cf\u5b50\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91cf\u5b50\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u78c1\u5834\u3092\u611f\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- N-V\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u91cf\u5b50\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6982\u8981"]}

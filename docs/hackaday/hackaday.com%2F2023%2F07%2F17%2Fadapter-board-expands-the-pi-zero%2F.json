Whether its migrating to alternative single-board computers or finding clones of the Pi that are close enough, there are solutions out there. This method of building a full-size Raspberry Pi\u00a0with all of the bells and whistles using the much-less-in-demand Pi Zero also stands out as a clever solution.\n[SpookyGhost] didnt build this one himself, but he did stumble across it and write a pretty extensive how-to and performance evaluation for the board, which can be found here. The adapter connects to the Zeros HDMI and USB ports, and provides all the connectors youd expect from a larger Pi such as the 3B. Its not a perfect drop-in replacement though  you dont get the 3.5 mm audio jack, and the micro SD card location doesnt match up with where it should be on a real Pi.\nAll things considered, this is one of those solutions that seems obvious in retrospect but we still appreciate its elegance. It might disappear as soon as chip shortages stop being an issue, but for now well take any solutions we can. If you dont already have a Pi Zero on hand, weve seen some other successes replacing them with thin clients or even old smartphones."}

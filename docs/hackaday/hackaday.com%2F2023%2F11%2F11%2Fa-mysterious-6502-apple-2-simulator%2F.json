But what if that wasnt the case? What if a simulator runs on the very hardware its simulating?\nThis is what [Tea Leaves] stumbled upon when he found a mysterious disk with only APL6502.SIM on it. [Tea Leaves] demonstrates the simulator with a basic 6502 assembly program, revealing an animated, beautiful Apple 2 simulator that actually runs on the Apple 2! The simulator shows all the major components of a 6502 and actually animates the complete data flow of an instruction.\nBut why is this mysterious? Its mysterious because  a hello program aside  its the only thing on the disk! Not so much as a single clue as to where it came from. [Tea Leaves] finds out where it comes from, including incorrectly copied disk images and a revelation at the end.\nVideo after the break.\n\n"}

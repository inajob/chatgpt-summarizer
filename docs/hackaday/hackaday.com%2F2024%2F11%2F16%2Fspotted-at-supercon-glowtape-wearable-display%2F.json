It looked phenomenal in person, with the energized areas on the tape glowing brightly during the evening festivities in the alleyway.\n\n\nThe text and images would fade fairly quickly, but in practice, thats hardly a problem when youre just trying to check the current time. If there was something to limit the practicality on this one, it would have to be the meter-long piece of material that youve got to keep pushing and pulling through the mechanism  but its a price were willing to pay.\nWant one of your own? [Henner] has shared all of the source code for the wearable, from the OpenSCAD scripts to generate the 3D printed enclosure to the C firmware for the RP2040 that runs the show. The LED array itself is actually a spin-off of his Glowxels project, which is worth checking out if youd like to recreate this concept on a much larger scale.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen this technique used for this kind of thing, but it may be the most compact version of the concept weve seen so far.\n", "title": "- \u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u5149\u308b\u6642\u8a08\u300cGlowtape\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30afaday\u3067\u306f\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u300cGlowtape\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002UV LED\u3068\u6697\u95c7\u3067\u5149\u308b\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u6642\u9593\u3084\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u5149\u308b\u6642\u8a08\u300cGlowtape\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- UV LED\u3068\u84c4\u5149\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u8155\u6642\u8a08", "- \u77ed\u3044\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b0\u611f\u899a\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9", "- Glowtape\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7121\u6599\u516c\u958b", "- \u78c1\u5834\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306e wearable \u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

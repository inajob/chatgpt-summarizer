Alternatively, you can make one yourself, and its not even that hard if youre kitted out with a 3D printer. [Creative 3D Printing] did just that with a nifty design that adds rotation into the mix. Check it out in the video below.\nWhy should a camera get all the fun? Try your phone.\nThe basic slider is built out of 3D-printed components and some good old aluminum extrusion. A small 12-volt motor trucks the camera cart back and forth using a leadscrew. Its torquey enough and slow enough that there isnt much need for more advanced control\u2014the motor just does the job. Theres also a limit switch set up to trigger a neat auto-reverse function.\nThe neat part, though, is the rotational mechanism. A smooth steel rod is attached to the sliders housing, which can be set up in a straight line or aligned diagonally if desired. In the latter case, it rotates the mounting on the camera cart via a crank, panning the camera as it moves along the sliders trajectory.\nIts a mechanically sophisticated design and quite unlike most of the camera sliders we feature around these parts.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": " motorized camera slider\u306f\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3002\u56de\u8ee2\u6a5f\u69cb\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u7528\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6a5f\u69cb\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u52d5\u304d", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u89e3\u8aac"]}

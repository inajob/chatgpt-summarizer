Alternatively, you can make one yourself, and its not even that hard if youre kitted out with a 3D printer. [Creative 3D Printing] did just that with a nifty design that adds rotation into the mix. Check it out in the video below.\nWhy should a camera get all the fun? Try your phone.\nThe basic slider is built out of 3D-printed components and some good old aluminum extrusion. A small 12-volt motor trucks the camera cart back and forth using a leadscrew. Its torquey enough and slow enough that there isnt much need for more advanced control\u2014the motor just does the job. Theres also a limit switch set up to trigger a neat auto-reverse function.\nThe neat part, though, is the rotational mechanism. A smooth steel rod is attached to the sliders housing, which can be set up in a straight line or aligned diagonally if desired. In the latter case, it rotates the mounting on the camera cart via a crank, panning the camera as it moves along the sliders trajectory.\nIts a mechanically sophisticated design and quite unlike most of the camera sliders we feature around these parts.\n\n"}

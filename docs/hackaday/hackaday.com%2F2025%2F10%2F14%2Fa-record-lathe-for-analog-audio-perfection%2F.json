But when a high quality audio project comes along that brings some serious engineering to the table were all there for it, so when we saw [Slyka] had published the files for their open source record lathe, we knew it had to be time to bring it to you.\nTruth be told weve been following this project for quite a while as they present tantalizing glimpses of it on social media, so while as they observe, documentation is hard, it should still be enough for anyone willing to try cutting their own recordings to get started. Theres the lathe itself, the controller, the software, and a tool for mapping EQ curves. It cuts in polycarbonate, though sadly there doesnt seem to be a sound sample online for us to judge.\nIf youre hungry for more this certainly isnt the first record lathe weve brought you, and meanwhile weve gone a little deeper into the mystique surrounding vinyl."}

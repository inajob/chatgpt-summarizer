The more outlandish of these builds, often inspired by science fiction and sporting non-traditional layouts, tend to be lumped together under the term cyberdecks, but there are certainly builds where that description doesnt quite stick, including the Cyber Writer from [Darbin Orvar].\nWith a 10-inch screen, you might think it was intended to be a portable, but its laser-cut Baltic birch plywood construction says otherwise. Its overall design reminds us of early computer terminals, and the 60% mechanical keyboard should help reinforce that feeling that youre working on a substantial piece of gear from yesteryear.\nTheres plenty of room inside for additional hardware.\nThe Cyber Writer is powered by the Raspberry Pi Zero W 2, which might seem a bit underpowered, but [Darbin] has paired it with a custom minimalist word processor. Theres not a lot of detail about the software, but the page for the project says it features integrated file management and easy email export of documents.\nThe software isnt yet available to the public, but it sounds like [Darbin] is at least considering it. Granted, theres already distraction-free writing software out there, but were pretty firm believers that theres no such thing as too many choices.\nIf youre looking for something a bit more portable, the impressive Foliodeck might be more your speed.\n\n"}

Back in the heyday of shortwave broadcasting, any of us would have given a weeks pay for even a low-end receiver today. Digital display? Memory? Digital filtering? These days, you have radios, and they arent terribly expensive, but there isnt much to listen to. Making matters worse, it isnt easy these days to string wires around in your neighborhood for a variety of reasons. Maybe you dont have a yard, or you have deed restrictions, or your yard lacks suitable space or locations. This problem is so common that there are a crop of indoor antennas that seem attractive. Since I dont often tune in shortwave and I dont want to have to reset my antenna after every storm, I decided to look at the Tecsun AN-48X along with a YouLoop clone from China. Lets start with the Tecsun.\nIn the Box\nThe Tecsun in a more or less diamond shape\nThe antenna is not terribly cheap at about $50 or so, but theres a lot in the box. The business end looks like something youd wear around your neck. A small box has a switch for three bands  LW, AM, and SW. the two wires coming out of that box form a loop. You can stick the loop to something using a suction cup or a hook. Theres also a little bar that looks like a standard telescoping antenna but it has two plastic clips on the end. You use this to form the loop into a diamond shape with the telescoping rod about halfway.\nAt the bottom of the box with the switch is a standard 1/8 jack. A cable connects that jack to a similar jack on the control unit which is about the size of a large pack of gum and has two AAA batteries inside. That box has a switch, two knobs, and a pigtail with another 1/8 jack.\nIf your radio takes a 1/8 plug for an antenna, thats where you connect it. If it doesnt, you have a few options. The box contains pigtails that convert the plug to BNC, RCA, alligator clips, or a ferrite bar that can couple to a radios internal antenna. You probably need SMA for a modern radio, so youll need an adapter. Theres also a plastic stand that can hold your radio and the ferrite bar if you are using it.\nThe knobs on the control box control the gain and tune the frequency of the antenna. Other than the switch close to the loop, all the other controls are on the control box, which stays close to your radio. So, as long as you dont care about jumping between LW, AM, and SW, you dont need to access the loop part during operation.\nA Few Tests\nI decided to try the antenna at a few different times a day in a few different locations. I used an old portable DAK shortwave receiver and also a more modern SDR receiver.\nThe Tecsun control box.\nFor the first test, I hung the loop on my upstairs stair rail and let the cable drop down to the first floor. During the day, WWV was barely audible, and there was little else to hear outside of noise. Granted, this was indoors. The signal level control didnt seem to do much. The tuning frequency knob reminded me of a regenerative receiver control. You could hear the device oscillate, and just past the oscillation, youd get the best signal. It made me wonder if the inner circuit was, in fact, a regenerative amplifier.\nThe portable shortwave uses a regular jack, but for the Malachite, I had to use a BNC to SMA adapter. Neither radio could pull much out. Nighttime reception was a little better, but not much.\nThe Great Outdoors\nUnsurprisingly, the device worked a little better outdoors. I hung it from an exposed beam on a pergola, and at night, there were a few fairly clear signals. During the daylight hours, WWV was elusive, but the Voice of America and Radio Havana  not too far from Houston  were easy to copy, especially if you understand French. I even managed to catch a few faint snags of WWVH.\nThe video below shows a few audio clips of the results. Forgive the outdoor glare on the screen in the first clip. I omitted the clips with music that YouTube might flag, but you get the idea.\n\nI also tested a YouLoop clone. This worked almost as well as the Techsun, but not quite as well. However, there was nothing to fidget with on the frequency.\nThe YouLoop\nThe YouLoop has an interesting idea. It uses coax for the loop and configures it like a Mobius strip so that it is kind of, an infinite loop. At the bottom is a balun with three connectors, and at the top is a phase inverter. That sounds fancy, but it really is just a box that connects the inside of one cable to the outside of the other. The antenna came with a powered preamp, although if your radio has a preamp, you probably dont need it.\nIt is handy that it just works, and the coax sections are stiff enough to be easy to handle when you want to hang it from a branch, for example. However, it also doesnt pack down as tightly, and the boxes are metal, which adds to the weight but is probably better for shielding.\nSignals on this loop were almost always lower in volume than the same signal from the Tecsun, even with the preamp. On the other hand, if you dont need the preamp, this antenna takes no batteries. It is simple enough that you can try it and see if you like it without a major investment.\nObservations\nThe Tecsun control board revealed\nWhile the Tecsun is light, I cant help but wonder if the shielded feedline might not have helped it. For both antennas, having the preamp close up to the feed point might pay off, although maybe some of the wire between the antenna and the control boxes or preamp becomes part of the antenna. It isnt, after all, a tuned antenna.\nThe Tecsuns control box frequency knob is maddeningly sensitive, but it does seem to help things. Inside the box is a tiny PCB, and I didnt find any online schematics.\nShould you run out and get either of these antennas? If you have other options, probably not. But if you need something, both of them are better than nothing.\nIf you havent had a shortwave radio in a while, they are surprisingly cheap these days. Well, most of them, anyway.", "title": "\"\u5c4b\u5185\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff1aTecsun AN-48X\u3068YouLoop Clone\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\"", "body": "Murphy's Law\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u77ed\u6ce2\u653e\u9001\u306e\u9686\u76db\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u8074\u304d\u305f\u3044\u756a\u7d44\u304c\u9650\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u5ba4\u5185\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u306a\u3069\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u5c4b\u5185\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff1aTecsun AN-48X\u3068YouLoop Clone\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\"", "\"Tecsun AN-48X\uff1a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"YouLoop Clone\uff1a\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\"", "\"\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u9078\u3073\uff1aTecsun vs YouLoop Clone\"", "\"\u5c4b\u5916\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u7c21\u6613\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6709\u52b9\u6027\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\""]}

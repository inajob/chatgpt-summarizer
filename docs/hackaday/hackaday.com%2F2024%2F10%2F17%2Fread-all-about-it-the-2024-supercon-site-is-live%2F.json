As always, Supercon is jam-packed with incredible content, so youll want to consult with the schedule to navigate your way through it. Dont worry if it ends up that two talks you want to see are scheduled for the same time  well be recording all of the talks and releasing them on the Hackaday YouTube channel, so you wont miss out.\nIf youre still on the fence, we do have a few tickets left at the time of this writing. All of the workshops are full at this point, but you can still get on the waiting list for a few of them just in case a spot opens up."}

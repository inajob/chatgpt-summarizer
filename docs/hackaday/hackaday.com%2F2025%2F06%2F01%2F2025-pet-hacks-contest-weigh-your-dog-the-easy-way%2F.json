If the critter in question is a cat or a small dog you can weigh yourself both holding them and not holding them, and compute the difference. But in the case of a full size Bernese mountain dog, the hound is simply too big for that. Lateral thinking is required, and thats how [Saren Tasciyan] came up with the idea of making a dog bed thats also a weighing machine. When the mutt settles down, the weight can be read with ease. The bed itself is a relatively straightforward wooden frame, with load cells placed above rubber feet. The load cells in turn talk to an ESP8266 which has an LCD display to deliver the verdict. Dog weighed, without the drama.\nThis project is of course part of the Hackaday 2025 Pet Hacks contest, an arena in which any of the cool hacks youve made to enhance you and your pets life together can have an airing. Meanwhile this isnt the first time this particular pooch has had a starring role; hes sported a rather fetching barrel in a previous post.\n \n\n"}

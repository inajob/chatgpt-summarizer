The Metascope Type B was a first-generation passive night vision viewer that relied on moonlight.\nThe video shows a 1946 technical paper from the Office of Scientific Research and Development with [Vannevar Bush] credited as the institutes director. If that name sounds familiar, you may remember that he foresaw hypertext (inspiring both [Doug Englebart] and the creation of the Web).\nThe Type B was an improvement over the older Type A, which had been tested during the invasion of North Africa in 1942. The type A weighed less than two pounds and was much smaller than the type B. However, it didnt work very well, so they stopped making them and did a redesign, which is what you see in the video. The type B weighed almost 5 pounds.\nTo use the metascope, you had to charge it with light and then wait. Eventually, youd need to charge it again. The type B allowed you to charge one phosphor plate while using another one. When that plate became weak, you could swap the plates to continue using the device.\nIf you arent keen on the history, you can skip to just before the 15-minute mark of the video for the hardware examination. He doesnt open the device, but thats probably wise, given the nature, age, and rarity of the metascope.\nModern image sensors are very sensitive to infrared, and normal cameras usually have filters to keep them out. Not that you cant remove it, of course. If you want to see something more modern, [Nick] built his own AN/PVS-14 night vision scope and you can too.\n\n", "title": "1946\u5e74\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8ad6\u6587\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u521d\u4ee3\u591c\u9593\u8996\u529b\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u3001Metascope Type B\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "body": "\u65b0\u578b\u56fa\u4f53\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u3088\u308a\u8efd\u304f\u3001\u3088\u308a\u512a\u308c\u305f\u591c\u9593\u8996\u91ce\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002Metascope Type B\u306f\u6708\u5149\u306b\u983c\u308b\u521d\u671f\u306e\u88ab\u52d5\u578b\u591c\u9593\u8996\u91ce\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7126\u70b9\u306f\u591c\u9593\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u8fd1\u4ee3\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u79fb\u308a\u3001AN/PVS-14\u591c\u9593\u8996\u91ce\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1946\u5e74\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8ad6\u6587\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u521d\u4ee3\u591c\u9593\u8996\u529b\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u3001Metascope Type B\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "Metascope Type B: \u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u578b\u591c\u9593\u8996\u529b\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2", "Metascope Type B: \u6708\u5149\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u521d\u4ee3\u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u578b\u591c\u9593\u8996\u529b\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2", "\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306aMetascope Type B\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u5909\u5316", "\u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u73fe\u4ee3\u3078\uff1aAN/PVS-14\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c"]}

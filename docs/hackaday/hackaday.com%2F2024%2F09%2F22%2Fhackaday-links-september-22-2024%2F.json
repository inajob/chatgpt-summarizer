Or maybe not, depending on how this report that China used Starlink signals to detect low-observable targets pans out. There arent a lot of details, and we couldnt find anything approximating a primary source, but it seems like the idea is based on forward scatter, which is when waves striking an object are deflected only a little bit. The test setup for this experiment was a ground-based receiver listening to the downlink signal from a Starlink satellite while a DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone was flown into the signal path. The drone was chosen because nobody had a spare F-22 or F-35 lying around, and its radar cross-section is about that of one of these stealth fighters. They claim that this passive detection method was able to make out details about the drone, but as with most reporting these days, this needs to be taken with an ample pinch of salt. Still, its an interesting development that may change things up in the stealth superiority field.\n\nAnother week, another example of how the fine print on the EULA is never your friend. This time around its the popular Wyze security cameras, where theres an unconfirmed report that a recent firmware update nerfed the Recording Cooldown setting menu, making the option to have no cooldown period between recording a paid feature. As we understand it, Wyze cameras previously had a cooldown feature, intended to keep the camera from overheating or killing the battery if the motion sensor detects a lot of continual movement. But it looks like earlier firmware revs allowed users to bypass the default five-minute period between recordings, a reasonable choice for anyone using these as security cameras. Now, bypassing the cooldown seems to require a paid subscription. We have to stress that we dont know anything beyond this one unconfirmed report, but this enshittification is certainly something weve seen before, so it at least rings true, and it seems like another solid example of the fact that with cheap IoT appliances, you never truly own your stuff.\nWe hate to be the bearers of bad news  well, that might be a stretch given the two articles above  but this is really the kind of news we hate to hear. The Eugene Makerspace in Eugene, Oregon, suffered a major fire in their community shop on September 15. Judging by the pictures, the place was pretty thoroughly destroyed, and the fact that it was an early morning fire probably contributed to the lack of injuries. Their GoFundMe campaign is doing pretty well, but they could certainly use some help getting back on their feet. If youre in a position to contribute, were sure theyd appreciate it.\nWhen it comes to OpenAIs newest AI model, youd better watch what you think  or rather, youd better not think too much about how the model thinks. Trying to get inside the models head is apparently against the terms of service, with users getting nastygrams from OpenAI warning them to step off. The Strawberry AI model has a feature that lets users have a glimpse into the chain of thought used to answer a question or complete a task, which on the face of it seems to be exactly what they dont want users to do. But the chain of thought is only a hand-waving summary of the raw thought process, filtered through a separate AI model. This is what OpenAI doesnt want people probing, and any attempts at engineering tricky prompts to reveal the raw chain of thought will potentially get you banned.\nAnd finally, although motorsports arent really our thing, we have to admit a certain sense of awe at this video that exposes some of the extreme engineering that goes into top fuel drag racing. Specifically, this video concentrates on drag racing, where nitromethane-fueled engines-on-wheels scream down a quarter-mile track in less than four seconds. Everything about this sport is extreme, especially the engines, which run themselves almost to death for the few seconds they are under full power. The video is packed full of tidbits that boggle the mind, such as these engines burning out their sparkplugs about halfway through the course, with the engine continuing to run in diesel mode thanks to the high compression and temperatures. Drivers experience a brain-squishing 8 g of acceleration during a run, which consumes over 30 gallons of fuel and exerts so much force on the engine that the connecting rods get compressed. The supercharger alone takes 800 horsepower to run, and yet the engine still produces enough power that the car is going 60 miles per hour before it covers its own length. Oh, and that ridiculous exhaust plume? Thats raw fuel that is purposely left unburned until it escapes the exhaust tips, which are angled to provide additional down-force to make sure as much torque as possible gets from the tires to the track. Enjoy!\n"}

Our lawyers advise us to clarify that its because of the demo-scene style music embedded in them, not because we used them for piracy. [Patch] must feel the same way, as he has a lovely historical retrospective out on The Internets Most Illegal Music (embedded below).\nAfter defining what hes talking about for the younger set, who may never have seen a keygen in this degenerate era of software-by-subscription,  traces the history of the jaunty chiptunes that were so often embedded in this genre of program. He starts with the early demoscene and its relationship with cracker groups  those are coders who circulate cracked versions of games, with the copyright protection removed. In the old days, theyd embed an extra loading screen to take credit for the dastardly deeds that our lawyer says to disavow.\nmore after the break\n\nBecause often the same people creating the amazing audio-video demos of the demoscene were involved in cracking, those loading screens could sometimes outshine the games themselves. (We saw it at a friends house one time.) There was almost always excellent music provided by the crackers, and given the limitations of the hardware of the era, it was what wed know of today as a chiptune.\nThe association between crackers and chiptunes lasted long after the chips themselves had faded into obsolescence. Part of the longevity of the tracker-built tunes is that in the days of dial-up youd much rather a keygen with a .MOD file embedded than an .mP3, or god forbid, an uncompressed .WAV that would take all day to download.\nNowadays, chiptunes are alive and well, and while they try and hearken back more to the demoscene than the less savory side of their history, the connection to peg-legged programmers is a story that deserves to be told. The best part of the video is the link to keygenmusic.tk/ where you can finally find out who was behind that bopping track thats been stuck in your head intermittently since 1998. (When you heard it at a computer lab, not on your own machine, of course.)\nThe demoscene continues to push old machines to new heights, and its spirit lives on in hacking machines like the RP2040.\n"}

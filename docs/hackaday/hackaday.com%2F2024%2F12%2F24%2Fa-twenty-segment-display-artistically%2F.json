And if you want to make characters as well as numbers, you can do an okay job with sixteen segments off the shelf. But if you want something more art-deco, youll probably want to roll your own. Or at least, [Ben] did, and you can find his designs up on GitHub.\nTaking inspiration from [Posy]s epic investigation of segmented displays, [Ben] sat down with a sketchpad and created his own 20-segment font that displays numbers and letters with some strange, but frankly lovely, segment shapes. There is no center line, so letters like T and numbers like 1 are a little skewed, but we think its charming.\nWeve seen about a bazillion takes on the seven-segment idea over the years here. Most recently, we fell in love with this 21-segment beauty, but honestly the original eight(!) segment patent version is charming as well. Anyway, picking a favorite segmented display at Hackaday is like picking your favorite child, if you have a few hundred children. We love them all.\n\n\nThanks [Aaron] for the tip!", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e20\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u72ec\u81ea\u306e20\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fBen\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e20\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30b3\u98a8\u306e\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080", "- \u6570\u5b57\u3068\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046"]}

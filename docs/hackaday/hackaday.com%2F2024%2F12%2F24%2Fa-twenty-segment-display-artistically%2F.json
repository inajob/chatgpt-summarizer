And if you want to make characters as well as numbers, you can do an okay job with sixteen segments off the shelf. But if you want something more art-deco, youll probably want to roll your own. Or at least, [Ben] did, and you can find his designs up on GitHub.\nTaking inspiration from [Posy]s epic investigation of segmented displays, [Ben] sat down with a sketchpad and created his own 20-segment font that displays numbers and letters with some strange, but frankly lovely, segment shapes. There is no center line, so letters like T and numbers like 1 are a little skewed, but we think its charming.\nWeve seen about a bazillion takes on the seven-segment idea over the years here. Most recently, we fell in love with this 21-segment beauty, but honestly the original eight(!) segment patent version is charming as well. Anyway, picking a favorite segmented display at Hackaday is like picking your favorite child, if you have a few hundred children. We love them all.\n\n\nThanks [Aaron] for the tip!"}

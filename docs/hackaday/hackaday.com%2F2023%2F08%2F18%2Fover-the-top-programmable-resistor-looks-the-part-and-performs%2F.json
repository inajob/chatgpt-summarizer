Not that projects need to be messy to be authentic, mind you, but there are some that are just so finished and professional looking that it gives us a bit of pause. [Sebastian]s programmable precision resistor is a shining example of such a project\nWhile [Sebastian] describes this as a glorified decade resistance box, and technically thats exactly right  at its heart its just a bunch of precision resistors being switched into networks to achieve a specific overall resistance  theres a lot more going on here than just that. The project write-up, which has been rolling out slowly over the last month or so, has a lot of detail on different topologies that could have been used  [Sebastian] settled on a switched series network that only requires six relays per decade while also minimizing the contribution of relay contact resistance to the network. Speaking of which, theres a detailed discussion on that subject, plus temperature compensation, power ratings, and how the various decades are linked together.\nFor as much thats interesting about whats under the hood, wed be remiss to not spend a little time praising the exterior of this instrument. [Sebastian] appears to have spared no expense to make this look like a commercial product, from the rack-mount enclosure to the HP-esque front panel. The UI is all discrete pushbuttons and knobs with a long string of 16-segment LEDs  no fancy touch-screens here. The panel layout isnt overly busy, and looks like it would be easy to use with some practice. Wed love to hear how the front and rear panel overlays were designed, too; maybe in a future project update.\nThis honestly looks like an instrument that youd pay a princely sum to Keithley or H-P to own, at least back in the late 1990s or so. Kudos to [Sebastian] for the attention to detail here."}

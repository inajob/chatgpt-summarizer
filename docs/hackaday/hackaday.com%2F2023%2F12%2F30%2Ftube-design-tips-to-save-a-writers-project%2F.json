Sometimes though, we come across a page thats not new, but is interesting in its own right enough to bring to your attention. So it is with our subject here, because when faced with a tube circuit design problem, we found salvation in a page from [The Valve Wizard].\nDo you need to apply negative feedback to a triode amplifier? The circuit is simplicity itself, but sadly when we were at university they had long ago stopped teaching the mathematics behind the component values. Step forward everything you need to know about triode amplifier negative feedback.\nNegative feedback is a pretty simple idea: subtract a little of the amplifiers output from the input. It reduces the amplifiers gain with a flat response, so its useful for removing humps in the frequency response and reducing the tendency for distortion. In a single-ended triode amp its done with a resistor and capacitor from anode to grid, but the question is, just what resistor or capacitor?. Here the page has all the answers, taking the reader through calculating the desired gain, and picking the value of the capacitor to avoid affecting the frequency response. We wish that someone had taught us this three decades ago!\nThe website is full of really useful info about valve or tube amps, and its worth mentioning that hes made it available in book format too. Theres no reason not to have a go at vacuum electronics. Meanwhile in case you are wondering what project prompted this, it was a quest to improve upon this cheap Chinese kit amplifier.", "title": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8ca0\u5e30\u9084\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3053\u3068\uff08The Valve Wizard\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u53c2\u7167\uff09", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u304c\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u5897\u5e45\u5668\u306e\u30cd\u30ac\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u9069\u5207\u306a\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3084\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u5024\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30cd\u30ac\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u306f\u3001\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u5fdc\u7b54\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3057\u3001\u6b6a\u307f\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u306e\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306f\u672c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8ca0\u5e30\u9084\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3053\u3068\uff08The Valve Wizard\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u53c2\u7167\uff09", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8ca0\u5e30\u9084\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u7279\u6027\u6539\u5584\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01\uff08The Valve Wizard\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306b\uff09", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8ca0\u5e30\u9084\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u6b6a\u307f\u4f4e\u6e1b\u306e\u6280\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u6539\u826f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5b66\u3093\u3060\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

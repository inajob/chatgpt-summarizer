(Credit: [glasslinger], YouTube)Doing electronics in the 1910s was rather rough, with the radio probably the pinnacle of hi-tech. Despite this, with some know-how and basic wood- and metal-working skills you could get pretty far with DIY-ing a radio set. As [glasslinger] demonstrates in a YouTube video, you can even build your own set with your own crafted tube-amplifier. With items like a hand-crafted resistor and capacitor  as well as tuning elements and period-correct point-to-point wiring  it definitely has that retro vibe to it.\nSuch DIY projects used to be very commonly featured in electronics magazine, even after the transistor came onto the scene by the 1950s. The fancier designs use a regenerative design, like this one by [Dick Whipple] which provides not only some background theory, but also the full schematic and how-to in case you feel like giving it a shake yourself.\nEven if youre not into crafting your own basic electronic components, radios like these are a great introduction to a lot of RF theory and amplification basics.\n\n", "title": "1912\u5e74\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092DIY", "body": "1912\u5e74\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e00\u7aef\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3002\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306e\u9802\u70b9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u77e5\u8b58\u3068\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u6728\u5de5\u3084\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3067\u3001DIY\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4f5c\u308c\u305f\u3002\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3084\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u8981\u7d20\u3001\u70b9\u5bfe\u70b9\u914d\u7dda\u306a\u3069\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["1912\u5e74\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092DIY", "1910\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u6280\u8853\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u3067\u4eba\u6c17\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "RF\u7406\u8ad6\u3068\u5897\u5e45\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u3001\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa"]}

This has caused consternation and annoyance alike, from the open source community angry at any liberties taken with the GPL, and from the community of RHEL users and customers concerned as to what it might mean for them.\nNow a new player has entered the fray in the form of SuSe, who have announced the creation of an RHEL fork with the intention of maintaining a freely-available Red Hat compatible operating system distribution.\nThis is good news for all who use Red Hat derived software and we expect the likes of Rocky Linux will be taking a close look at it, but its also a canny move from the European company as they no doubt hope to tempt away some of those commercial Red Hat customers with a promise of stability and their existing experience supporting Red Hat users through their mixed Linux support packages. We hope theyll continue to maintain their relationship with the open source world, and that the prospect of their actions unleashing a new commercial challenge causes Red Hat to move away from the brink a little.\nNeed some of the backstory? Weve got you covered.\nThe perfect header for this story comes via atzerok, CC BY-SA 2.0.", "title": "\u300cRed Hat\u76f8\u5f53\u306eOS\u3092\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308bSuse\u306e\u767b\u5834\u300d", "body": "Red Hat\u304c\u6709\u6599\u5316\u3092\u9032\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3084RHEL\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u61f8\u5ff5\u306e\u58f0\u304c\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002SuSe\u304cRHEL\u4e92\u63db\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u5546\u696d\u7684\u306a\u6311\u6226\u3092\u884c\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Red Hat\u306f\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u8ffd\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRed Hat\u76f8\u5f53\u306eOS\u3092\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308bSuse\u306e\u767b\u5834\u300d", "\u300cRed Hat\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u6709\u511f\u5316\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u53cd\u767a\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u300d", "\u300cSuse\u304cRHEL\u306e\u6d3e\u751f\u7248\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u3068\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u5546\u7528\u9867\u5ba2\u306e\u5fc3\u3092\u3064\u304b\u3080\u300d", "\u300cRocky Linux\u306a\u3069\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u8005\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3059\u308b\u3001Suse\u306eRHEL\u4e92\u63db\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u300d", "\u300cSuse\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5546\u7528\u7af6\u4e89\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u3001Red Hat\u3092\u5c11\u3057\u5f8c\u9000\u3055\u305b\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u300d"]}

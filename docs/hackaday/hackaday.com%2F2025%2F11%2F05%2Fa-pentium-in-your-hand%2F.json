Handheld retrocomputers face something of an uphill struggle though, as many of the components are over-sized, and use a lot of power. [Changliang Li] has taken on the task though, putting an industrial Pentium PC in a rather well-designed SLA printed case.\nAside from the motherboard theres a VGA screen, a CompactFlash card attached to the IDE interface, and a Logitech trackball. As far as we can see the power comes from a USB-C PD board, and theres a split mechanical keyboard on the top side. It runs Windows 98, and a selection of peak 90s games are brought out to demonstrate.\nWe like this project for its beautiful case and effective use of parts, but were curious whether instead of the Pentium board it might have been worth finding a later industrial PC to give it a greater breadth of possibilities, there being few x86 SBCs. Either way it would have blown our minds back in 98, and we can see its a ton of fun today. Take a look at the machine in the video below the break.\n\n\nThanks [Stephen Walters] for the tip."}

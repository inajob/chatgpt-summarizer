Hunter Adams professed his love for embedded engineering, but he might as well have been singing the songs of our people \u2013 the hackers. If you occasionally feel the need to explain to people why you do what you do, at fancy cocktail parties or something, this talk is great food for thought. It\u2019s about as good a \u201cWhy We Hack\u201d as I\u2019ve ever seen.\nAmong the zingers, \u201cprojects are filter removers\u201d stuck out. When you go through life, there are a lot of things that you kinda understand. Or maybe you\u2019ve not even gotten around to thinking about whether you understand them or not, and just take them for granted. Life would all simply be too complicated if you took it all sufficiently seriously. Birdsong, Bluetooth, the sun in the sky, the friction of your car\u2019s tire on various surfaces. These are all incredibly deep subjects, when you start to peel back the layers.\nAnd Hunter\u2019s point is that if you are working on a project that involves USB, your success or failure depends on understanding USB. There\u2019s no room for filters here \u2013 the illusion that it \u201cjust works\u201d often comes crashing down until you learn enough to make it work. Some of his students are doing projects cooperatively with the ornithology department, classifying and creating birdsong. Did you know that birds do this elaborate frequency modulation thing when they sing? Once you hear it, you know, and you hear it ever more.\nSo we agree with Hunter. Dive into a project because you want to get the project done, sure, but pick the project because it\u2019s a corner of the world that you\u2019d like to shine light into, to remove the filters of \u201cI think I basically understand that\u201d. When you get it working, you\u2019ll know that you really do. Hacking your way to enlightenment? We\u2019ve heard crazier things.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

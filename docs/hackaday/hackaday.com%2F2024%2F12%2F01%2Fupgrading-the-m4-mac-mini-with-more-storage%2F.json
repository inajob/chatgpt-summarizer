Repair legend [dosdude1] shows us how the new M4 Mac mini can get a sizeable storage upgrade without paying the Apple tax.\nThe Mac mini is Apples least expensive machine, and in the old days you could swap a SATA drive for more storage and not pay the exorbitant prices that OEMs demand. Never one to turn down a walled garden, later Intel machines and now the ARM-based M-series chips soldered storage into the machine leaving an upgrade out of the hands of anyone without a hot air station.\nBoth the Mac Studio and Mac mini now have proprietary storage cards, and after some tinkering, [dosdude1] has successfully upgraded the storage on the base model M4 mini. While most people dont casually reball NAND chips while chatting on a video, his previous work with others in the space to make a Mac Studio upgrade kit give us hope well soon see economical storage upgrades that keep the Mac mini affordable.\nWeve previously covered the first time Apple tried to make its own processors, and some of their more recent attempts at repairability.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30df\u30cbM4\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "Apple\u306eM4 Mac mini\u306f\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30df\u30cbM4\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u81ea\u529b\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01Apple\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u624b\u6cd5", "dosdude1\u304c\u793a\u3059\u3001Mac mini\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u6539\u9020\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Apple\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aM4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30df\u30cb\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u62e1\u5f35"]}

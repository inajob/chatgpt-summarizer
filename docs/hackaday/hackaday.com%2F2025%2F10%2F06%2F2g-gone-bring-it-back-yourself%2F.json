The legendary [dosdude1] shows us it need not be so, however: Building a Custom 2G GSM Cellular Base Station is not out of reach, if you are willing to pay for it. His latest videos show us how.\nBefore you start worrying about the FCC or its equivalents, the power here is low enough not to penetrate [dosdude]s walls, but technically this does rely in flying under the radar. The key component is a Nuand BladeRF x40 full-duplex Software Defined Radio, which is a lovely bit of open-source hardware, but not exactly cheap. Aside from that, all you need is a half-decent PC (it at least needs USB-3.0 to communicate with the SDR, the YateBTS\u00a0 software (which [dosdude1] promises to provide a setup guide for in a subsequent video) and a sim card reader. Plus some old phones, of course, which is rather the whole point of this exercise.\nThe 2G sunset, especially when followed by 3G, wiped out whole generations of handhelds  devices with unique industrial design and forgotten internet protocols\u00a0that are worth remembering and keeping alive. By the end of the video, he has his own little network, with the phones able to call and text one another on the numbers he set up, and even (slowly) access the internet through the miniPCs network connection.\nUnlike most of the hacks weve featured from [dosdude1], you wont even need a soldering iron, never mind a reflow oven for BGA.\u00a0\n\n"}

Theyll also cover how a clever software patch improves the graphics in a flight simulator from the 1990s, and why spacecraft flying into orbit powered by the SABRE engine is going to remain a dream for now.\nFrom there youll hear about a reproduction VW gas gauge that works better than the real thing, custom ball screws, and the latest and greatest in homebrew battery charging. Finally, theyll cap the episode off by exploring the conundrum thats heating up Londons Underground, and diving into the (mostly) fictional history of teleportation.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nDirect Download Link\n\nEpisode 299 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Europe returns to Berlin on March 14th to the 16th!

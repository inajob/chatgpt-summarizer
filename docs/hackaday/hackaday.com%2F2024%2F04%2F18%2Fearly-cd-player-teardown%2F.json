[w1ngsfly] shows us the inside of a Phase Linear 9500 player from 1983. Not only does it have many components, but it is also mechanically unusual.\nThe CD loads into a toaster-like slot and even pops out like a piece of toast. The tracking mechanism is quite complex, and theres something that looks suspiciously like a dial string from an old slide rule tuner radio. Apparently, the unit was made by Kyocera and is internally similar to a Kyocera DA-01.\nTheres a head position indicator that is actually just an LED connected to the tracking mechanism. The front panel controls look great but also allow you to control the head position exactly. As [w1ngsfly] mentions, it is almost like moving a turntables tonearm where you can drop it anywhere you want.\nIf we recall, they were about $600 to $1,000 new. If Phase Linear doesnt ring a bell, they were well known in their day. Founded by [Bob Carver] and [Steve Johnston], the company was bought by Pioneer before the introduction and, later, by Jensen before the introduction of the 9500. [Bob] would go on to found Carver Corporation. You can find plenty of history about the company online.\nWeve seen CD players that look older. These days, CD drives are cheap and they are easy enough to control.\n\n", "title": "CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\uff1a1983\u5e74\u306ePhase Linear 9500\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "body": "1983\u5e74\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305fPhase Linear 9500 CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3002\u30c8\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306bCD\u3092\u633f\u5165\u30fb\u6392\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u69cb\u3084\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u7684\u3002\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306fKyocera\u88fd\u306eDA-01\u306b\u4f3c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002 ", "titles": ["CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\uff1a1983\u5e74\u306ePhase Linear 9500\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u306b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\uff1a1983\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306ePhase Linear 9500 CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc", "Kyocera\u88fd\u54c1\u3068\u306e\u985e\u4f3c\u6027\uff1aPhase Linear 9500 CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "LED\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\uff1aPhase Linear 9500 CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u8ffd\u8de1\uff1a1983\u5e74\u306ePhase Linear 9500 CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u69cb"]}

Since they can move just about any tool around in 3D space, you can also use them for plotter tasks, a fact that [Geoffrey Gao] made use of when he had to write labels for a stack of music tapes. The resulting FS-Plotter project is based around a Creality Ender 3 FDM printer. Standard g-code from PrusaSlicer is used to move a pen around, after the latter has been fitted into a (3D-printed) spring-loaded fixture.\nThe cassette tape is fitted into its own fixture that is attached to the printer bed to hold it in place, while the writing utensil can move in its spring-loaded fixture to account for some unevenness on the surface its writing on. In the linked GitHub project a PrusaSlicer profile is provided that can generate 2D plotter Gcode. Where [Geoffrey] says that this project is very useful to him as a musician is that it enables him to make small runs of tapes with professional printing, without running into extra expenses.\nBeyond putting a writing utensil into the holder, it could also be used for light engraving and similar tasks, while still making it possible to switch between the FDM hotend and this plotter attachment as needed. For about $30 in parts, it doesnt seem like a bad deal to get a small-ish plotter and maybe give that old Ender 3 a second life.", "title": "Creality Ender 3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fFS-Plotter\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528", "body": "FDM 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306f\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002FS-Plotter\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u30da\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u97f3\u697d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u56fa\u5b9a\u3057\u3001PrusaSlicer\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30b4\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30b9\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u30662D\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bfGcode\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Creality Ender 3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fFS-Plotter\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528", "\u97f3\u697d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306aFS-Plotter\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u97f3\u697d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30e9\u30d9\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "\u8efd\u3044\u5f6b\u523b\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01$30\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u5c0f\u578b\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30d7\u30ed\u306e\u5370\u5237\u54c1\u8cea\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bFS-Plotter\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

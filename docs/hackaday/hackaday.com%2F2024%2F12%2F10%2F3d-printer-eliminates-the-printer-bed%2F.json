The bed might not always be the correct temperature leading to problems with adhesion of the print, it could be uncalibrated or dirty or cause any number of other issues that ultimately lead to a failed print. Most of us work these problems out through trial and error and eventually get settled in, but this novel 3D printer instead removes the bed itself and prints on whatever surface happens to be nearby.\nThe printer is the product of [Daniel Campos Zamora] at the University of Washington and is called MobiPrint. It uses a fairly standard, commercially available 3D printer head but attaches it to the base of a modified robotic vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner is modified with open-source software that allows it to map its environment without the need for the manufacturers cloud services, which in turn lets the 3D printer print on whichever surface the robot finds in its travels. The goal isnt necessarily to eliminate printer bed problems; a robot with this capability could have many more applications in the realm of accessibility or even, in the future, printing while on the move.\nThere were a few surprising discoveries along the way which were mentioned in an IEEE Spectrum article, as [Campos Zamora] found while testing various household surfaces that carpet is surprisingly good at adhering to these prints and almost cant be unstuck from the prints made on it. There are a few other 3D printers out there that weve seen that are incredibly mobile, but none that allow interacting with their environment in quite this way.\n\n", "title": "\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cMobiPrint\u300d\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u3068\u306f", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcMobiPrint\u306f\u3001\u5e8a\u9762\u3067\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u6383\u9664\u6a5f\u304c\u52d5\u304d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5370\u5237\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cMobiPrint\u300d\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u3068\u306f", "\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u9078\u3070\u306a\u3044\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u6383\u9664\u6a5f\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5370\u5237\u65b9\u5f0f", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u6301\u3064\u610f\u5916\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6027\u80fd", "\u5370\u5237\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4e0d\u8981\u306b\u3059\u308b\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee33D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834"]}

Here at Hackaday, we\u2019re simply thankful for all of you out there. The readers who make Hackaday worth writing for, and the hackers out there who give us something to write about.\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that we have one of the most bizarrely creative communities out there, and we\u2019re thankful to still be chronicling all of the inventive madness, all of the engineering feats, and all of the projects that succeed and those that fail. It\u2019s truly a pleasure, day in and day out, to read and to write about.\nSo thank you all for being Hackaday, for sticking with us through our 20th year now, and for continuing to share your hacks and sending in the tips when you see one that you\u2019d like us to share. Keep on hacking, and we can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019re up to in 2025.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

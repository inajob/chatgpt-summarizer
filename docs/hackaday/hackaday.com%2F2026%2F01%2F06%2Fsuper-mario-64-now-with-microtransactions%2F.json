A console or budget PC might only cost a few hundred dollars, and modern games like Hollowknight: Silksong can provide 40-60 hours of experience for only around $20 USD. This value proposition wasnt really there in the 80s, where arcade cabinets like\u00a0Gauntlet might have cost an inflation-adjusted $8 per hour in quarters. This paradigm shift is great for gamers, but hasnt been great for arcade owners. [PrintAndPanic] wanted to bring some of that old coin munching vibe into console gaming, and so added a credit system to Super Mario 64.\nThe project is a fork of a decompilation of Super Mario 64, which converts the original machine code into a human-friendly format so bugs can be fixed and other modern features added. With the code available, essentially anyone can add features into the game that werent there already. In this case, [PrintAndPanic] is using a Raspberry Pi connected to a coin slot, so when coins are put into the game like an old arcade machine, the Raspberry Pi can tell the modified version of Super Mario 64 to add credits. These credits allow the player to run and jump, and when the credits run out Mario becomes extremely limited and barely able to outrun even the slowest Bombombs and Goombas.\nWith some debugging out of the way and the custom game working, [PrintAndPanic] built a custom enclosure for the game and the coin slot to turn it into a more self-contained arcade-style machine. The modified code for this project is available on the projects GitHub page for those who want to play a tedious version of a favorite video game that costs more money than it should.\nThere are plenty of other modifications for this classic as well, most of which involve improving the game instead of adding a modern microtransaction-based system.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u3092\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u6642\u9593\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u8da3\u5473\u3002\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u306b\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u305f\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u3092\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01", "- \u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u6295\u5165\u578b\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u3067\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f53\u9a13", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u98a8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

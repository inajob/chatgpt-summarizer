There are full set-up instructions, and once its in place and configured it presents the dial as though it were a number pad.\nWe like this project, in fact we like it a lot. Interfacing with a dial is always something weve done with a microcontroller though, so it will be interesting to see whether it finds a use beyond merely curiosity. We can already see a generation of old-school dial IP phones using Linux-capable dev boards. He leaves us with a brief not as to whether Linus Torvalds would see it as worthy of mainline inclusion, and sadly however much we want things to be different, we agree that it might be wishful thinking.\nIf youd like to use a dial phone, there can be simpler ways to do it.\n\nHeader: Billy Brown, CC BY 2.0 .", "title": "- \u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u3092Linux\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Linux\u7528\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u304c\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u306f\u7591\u554f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u3092Linux\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u7528\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- GPIO\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aLinux\u3067\u306e\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

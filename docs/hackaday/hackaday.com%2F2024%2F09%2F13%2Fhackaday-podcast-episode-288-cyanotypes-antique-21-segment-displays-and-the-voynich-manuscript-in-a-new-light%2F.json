Our luck was pretty good, too, seeing how we stumbled upon a coffee table that walks your drink over to you on Strandbeest legs, a potato that takes passable photographs, and a cool LED display three times better than a boring old seven-segment.\nIf youve never heard of the Voynich manuscript, youre in luck too, because we got a chance to look inside this medieval comic book literally, with multispectral analysis.

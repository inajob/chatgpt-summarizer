Looking to create a similar experience but for electronic projects, [Mike Ayles] created CircuitSnips  a searchable database of ready-to-use KiCad schematics available under open source licenses.\nLooking for reference designs for LiPo chargers? CircuitSnips has you covered. Want to upload your own design so others can utilize it? Even better. Currently, there are over four thousand circuits on CircuitSnips, although not all have been put there purposely. To get the project off the ground, [Mike] scrapped GitHub for open source KiCad projects. While this doesnt run afoul of the licensing, theres a mechanism in place for anyone who wants to have their project removed from\u00a0 the repository.\nTo scrape the depths of GitHub, [Mike] had to simplify the text expression for the KiCad projects using a tool hes since released. For anyone so inclined, hes even put the entire site on GitHub for anyone who wants to try their hand at running it locally.\nCircuitSnaps fills a very specific space to post your circuit diagrams, but if youre looking for somewhere to host your complete designs, we cant fail to mention Hackadays own repository for hardware projects and hacks!"}

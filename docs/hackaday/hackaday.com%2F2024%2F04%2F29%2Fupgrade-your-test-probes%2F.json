Today, even a cheap meter has capabilities that would have been either very expensive or unobtainable back in the 1970s. Still, even then, a meter was the most affordable way to do various tasks around the shop. Is this cable open? Are these two wires shorted? Whats the value of this resistor? Is the circuit getting power? Is the line voltage dropping? You can answer all those questions  and many more  with a basic meter. But theres one thing that hasnt changed much over the years: probes. Thats a shame because there are a lot of useful options.\nThe probes that came with your meter probably have much in common with the probes a 1970-era meter had. Yeah, the banana plugs probably have a little plastic cover, and the plastic itself might be a little different. Parts are small these days, so the tips might be a little finer than older probes. But if you sent your probes back in time, few people would notice them.\nThe Blinders Syndrome\nOne problem is that those probes are usually good enough. Weve all clipped an alligator clip to a test probe. Ive even fashioned super pointy probes out of syringes. Years ago, I bought an expensive kit with many attachments I rarely use, like little hooks and spade lugs. Then, I happened to go down the wrong aisle at Harbor Freight.\nBack probes ready for action.\nIn the automotive section, I noticed a tidy plastic box labeled 22 pc. back probe kit. Id never heard the term back probe, but it was clearly some sort of wire. It turns out the kit has a bunch of very fine needles on banana jacks and some patch cables to connect them to your meter.\nThey are back probes because you can jam them in the back of connectors next to the wire. There are five colors of needles, and each color set has three items: a straight needle, a bent needle, and a 90-degree bend needle.\nId never heard of this, and that started me down the rabbit hole of looking at what other exotic probes were out there. If you search the usual sources for back probe, youll see plenty of variations. There are also tons of inexpensive probe kits with many useful tips for different situations. Like everything, the price was much lower than I had paid for the rarely used kit I bought years ago. The only thing I really use out of that kit are the test hook clips and you can buy those now for a few bucks that just push over your probes.\nChoices\nWire-piercing probe works best for larger wires.\nYou could probably use the needles to stick through insulation, too. But if thats your goal, they make piercing clip test probes specifically for that purpose. A little plastic holder has a hook for your wire and a needle that threads in to penetrate the wire.\nThese alligator clips fit over most probes.\nI also picked up some little alligator clips that slide over standard 2mm probe tips. These are very handy and prevent you from having to clip a lead to your probe so you can clip the other end to the circuit. However, if you look for a test lead kit, youll find many options for about $20. One kit had interchangeable probe tips, alligator clips, spades, SMD tweezers, and tiny hooks for IC legs. The alligator clips on the one I bought are the newer style that has a solid insulating body  not the cheap rubbery covers. They feel better and are easier to handle, too.\nBreadboarding\nSome of the accessories in the test probe kit.\nOf course, you can make your own solderless breadboard jumpers, and youve probably seen that you can buy jumpers of various kinds. But if you search, you can even find test probes with breadboard wire ends. The other end will terminate in a test hook or alligator clips. You can also get them with banana plugs on the end to plug right into your meter. You can usually find versions with the male pin for a breadboard or a female receptacle for connecting to pins.\nOf course, we love hacking components to fit on breadboards. Weve also seen custom slip-on adapters, which are worth checking out if you are looking to up your probe game.", "title": "\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u9053\u5177\u306e1\u3064\u306f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u30021970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u3063\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3001\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u5b89\u3044\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u9577\u5e74\u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u9078\u629e", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u88cf\u5074\u306b\u5dee\u3057\u8fbc\u3080\u5148\u7aef\u91dd\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30a3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u5148\u7aef\u3092\u5099\u3048\u308b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3084\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u7528"]}

Would you even hear it? Chances are, if youre rocking out to music on headphones and your treadmill is as noisy as [Antonio]s, you wouldnt, and youd once again face the dreaded well try later slip.\nWhat you need is something that thing listens for the doorbell and flashes a giant 20 mm red LED to alert you. Could this be done with a 555? Yes, in fact, [Antonio] used a pair of them in the form of the 556 on the alert side.\nThe first 555 is wired up in astable mode to control the tempo of the flashing light, and the second timer is in monostable mode to control the length of time the light flashes. Power comes from the doorbells 9V, which is wired up through an existing Ethernet jack.\nNow whenever the doorbell rings, [Antonio] has 60 seconds of flashing light in order to react, stop the treadmill, and jump off to answer the door. To conserve power when [Antonio] is relaxing, theres an on/off switch."}

This is the first stable release since 1.3 was released in 2022.\nFreeDOS saw its first release in 1994 and has become the de facto replacement for MS-DOS  featuring many improvements to make it work well on modern hardware and a package manager to manage installed software much like on Linux  BSD. The new kernel didnt quite make it into this release, but it and some other items will be available in the monthly test builds.\nYou can download the new 1.4 release here, with live  installer CD images, a USB installer and even a Floppy Edition available. System requirements include an (Intel) x86 CPU, a BIOS (or legacy UEFI mode), 640 kB of RAM and 20 MB of storage.", "title": "- 2025\u5e74\u3082\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0(DOS)", "body": "FreeDOS 1.4\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305fDOS\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- 2025\u5e74\u3082\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0(DOS)", "- FreeDOS 1.4\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9: \u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6982\u8981", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308bFreeDOS\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u4ee3\u66ffMS-DOS: FreeDOS\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- FreeDOS 1.4\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u8981\u4ef6"]}

According to [WesternRedCdar] they are just for fun, although they do allow for pressing Ctrl and Alt at the same time with a single thumb.\nOh, and are those Nintendo Switch joysticks above the PS2 buttons? Those are for the mouse and vertical/horizontal scrolling. Honestly, this seems like a great amount of thumb controls. The basics are there (presumably), and there isnt any thumb-extending excess, like keys on the insides by the mouse.\nThis bad mama jama runs on an RP2040 and has 50 hand-wired Cherry Brown switches plus the PS2 buttons. In the build guide, you can read all about [WesternRedCdar]s troubles with integrating those. The Nintendo Switch joysticks werent terribly easy, either, since the ribbon connector cant be soldered directly.\nThe final issue was one of weight. Since many of the switches stand quite tall, it sort of jostles the keyboard to actuate them. [WesternRedCdar] opined that that the ideal solution would have been to use metal base plates instead of wood, but took care of the issue by adding layers of 1/8 steel flat bar inside the case.\n\nGone in 60 Seconds: the Micro Journal Rev. 7 From Tindie\nDont know what took me so long to find r/writerDeck, but here we go! [WorkingAmbition7014] was quite excited to announce there that [Background_Ad_1810] aka [Un Kyu Lee]s Micro Journal rev. 7 was up on Tindie. Its already sold out, but thats okay because previous versions are already open-source, and its just a matter of time before this new revision makes its way to the ole GitHub.\nNearly NSFW image by [Un Kyu Lee] via TindieYou may remember our coverage of the third iteration from about a year ago. Look how far it has come since then! Although the overall portability has kind of taken a dive, it sure does look great from where Im sitting. Maybe its just that lovely color scheme, but to me it has sort of a softened-up mil-spec look.\nThis distraction-free machine is based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. It starts up right away, and you can start typing pretty much immediately on the ePaper screen. There are a pair of knobs that go a long way toward its typewriter looks; the left one wipes the screen and puts the machine to sleep, and the right knob clears the screen in the case of too much ghosting.\nFiles are saved on the SD card that sits behind the screen, or you can send them to Google Drive. Now, it doesnt come with that cool clip light, but it doesnt have a backlight, either, so youll probably want to bring your own. You will also have to source your own 18650. Be sure to check out the overview after the break.\n\nThe Centerfold: Purple Paradise\nImage by [Majestic-Fox-550] via redditIsnt this cozy and fresh? Some might say its too cool-toned overall, but I think the peach parts help it strike a balance. Again, I dont know much, but that keyboard is a Feker Galaxy 80, and the desk mat is from The Mousepad Company. I dont think those cloud wrist rests are too hard to find; Ive even seen them at Five Below before.\nI love these setup pictures, but I have to wonder, does anyone really keep their desk this clean and tidy? Of course not, its for the shot, youre saying. But thats my point. Why does everyone always tidy up so hard first? I want to see battle stations in their true forms sometimes. I feel like we got sorta close last week in the one with all the screens. So do I need to inspire centerfold submissions by showing my own battle station one of these times? I dont know if yall really want that.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Ford Typewriter\nIsnt this machine a beauty? And no, inventor Eugene A. Ford bore no relation to Henry Ford the automobile maker. But wouldnt this look grand while perched briefly on the running board of your Model T for a quick daguerreotype?\nImage via The Martin Howard Collection\nLovely as she was, the 1895 Ford was no fun for the typist. The Space bar-placed Shifts required real pressure to properly operate, and the keys are evidently springy and wobbly. Springy sounds intriguing; wobbly does not.\nAdditionally, the advancing lever doesnt allow going backwards or forwards a line at a time. But the one great thing about the Ford was that its a visible writer, whereas most machines of the time were blind writers, meaning you were unable to see what you were typing without stopping and doing something first. It wasnt the first visible writer, but it might be the easiest to look at.\nWhat it did do first is use aluminium in its construction, although there were two versions, one with an all-aluminium frame and carriage, and the other with a black, enameled cast iron frame and and an aluminium carriage. The cast iron went for $75, and the lighter-weight aluminium machine for $85. Both were lateral thrust machines, which means that the type bars are spread out like a fan and move horizontally to strike the platen.\nEugene Ford had quite the career. After putting his typewriter on the market in 1895, he worked with IBM for the rest of his life, and became chief development engineer of the New York laboratories in 1911. During his tenure, he developed improvements to various punched card accounting machines, sorters, and counters.\nFinally, a Keyboard for Cat Lovers\nCats and keyboards go together like peanut butter and jelly. When theyre not straight up walking across it, theyre fluffing it up. Well, why not admit defeat and get this cozy cat-themed keyboard?\nThis is the Dry Studio Petbrick 65, which comes in calico and black, which is called the odd-eyed design, presumably because the kitty on the Escape key has heterochromia.\nImage via Dry Studio\nNow thats just the keyboard itself that comes in calico and black; soon youll be able to get all kinds of fuzzy bezels, which attach with magnets and are hand-washable, thankfully.\nThe Petbrick 65 isnt just some cutesy little thing. This is a serious mechanical keyboard with a sandblasted POM plate, a specially-tuned (what? how?) cotton poron switch pad, PET film for the sake of acoustics, and two layers of sound-dampening foam.\nThe switches are custom-made crystal pinks that were developed in-house and look pretty slick. If you dont like them, the PCB is hot-swappable. And they didnt stop there  the keycaps have dye-sublimated legends for longevity.\nWould I type on this? I would, at least until it became uncomfortable for my RSI situation. Im interested to try these crystal pink switches and feel the fluffiness of the frame on the heels of my hands.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it?

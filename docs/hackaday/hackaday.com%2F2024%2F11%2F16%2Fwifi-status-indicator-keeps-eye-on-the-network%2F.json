But despite all of the latest technology, things still occasionally go pear-shaped  meaning that blistering fiber optic connection youve got to the worlds collected knowledge (not to mention, memes) can still go down when you need it the most.\nAfter suffering some connectivity issues, [Arnov Sharma] decided to put together a little box that could alert everyone in visual range to the status of the local router. It wont fix the problem, of course, but theres a certain value to getting timely status updates. Using a 3D printed enclosure and a couple of custom PCBs, the build is fairly comprehensive, and could certainly be pressed into more advanced usage if given the appropriate firmware. If youve been thinking of a Internet-connected status indicator, this is certainly a project worth copying studying closely.\n\nThe aptly named Wi-Fi Status Box uses two PCBs: one to hold the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 microcontroller and four WS2812B addressable LEDs, and another that plays host to the IP5306 power management IC.\nThat latter board in particular is something you may want to file away for a future project, as it not only handles charging lithium-ion batteries such as common 18650 cells, but it also features an LED fuel gauge and the ability to boost the output power to 5 VDC with relatively few external components.\nAs for the firmware on this one, its simplicity itself. The goal is to see if the router has gone down, so all the code does is check every ten seconds to see if the ESP32 is still able to connect to the given wireless network. If the connection is good the LEDs are green, but if the link fails, they flip over to red. Combined with a printed front panel that uses transparent filament to soften the glow of the LEDs, and youve got an attractive way of knowing when its time to panic.\nToo obvious for you? Perhaps youd prefer this version that uses an analog multimeter to display when the net drops out."}

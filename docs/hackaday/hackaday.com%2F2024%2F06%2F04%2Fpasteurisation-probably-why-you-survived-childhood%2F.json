The idea is that they are exposed to far more dirt and eat food much closer to the field than their urban cousins. Without the help of a handy microbiologist or epidemiologist its difficult to judge its veracity, but personal experience suggests that the bit about dirt may be true at least.\nIts Dangerous To Idealise The Past.\nIts likely that the idea of rural kids seeing more bugs may come from the idea that those in the cities consume sterile processed food from the supermarket, it plays into a notion of an idealised past in which a somehow purer diet came more directly from its source. Somehow so the story goes, by only eating pasteurised and preserved foods, city dwellers are eating something inferior, stripped of its goodness. Theres a yearning for a purer alternative, something supermarkets are only too happy to address by offering premium products at elevated prices. So, was the diet of the past somehow more wholesome, and are those kids having their future health ruined by Big Food? Perhaps its time to turn back the clock a little to find out.\nEven clean cows have bugs. Carolyn Parsons, CC BY-SA 4.0.\nIts likely everyone knows that food\u00a0 spoils if left unattended for long enough. Some foods, such as grain, can last a long time if kept dry, while others such as milk will go bad quite quickly. Milk in particular goes bad for two reasons; firstly because its an excellent bacterial growth medium, and secondly because it contains plenty of bacteria by its very nature. Even very clean cows have bugs.\nIf you lived in most large cities in the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution had likely placed you far enough from the nearest cow that your milk had a significant journey to make to reach you even with up-to-date rail transport. Without refrigeration, during that journey it had become a bacterial soup to the extent that even though it might not yet have gone sour, it had certainly become a bacterial brew. It was thus responsible for significant numbers of infections, and had become a major health hazard. So much for the purer diet consumed by city kids of the past.\nHeat ( and Louis Pasteur) To The Rescue\nThe knowledge that heat can be used to preserve food can be traced back hundreds or even thousands of years, and by the nineteenth century that had been developed into the bottling and canning processes which we use today. These rely on sealing food into a container, and cooking it in the container by placing it in boiling water, with the result being a can of perfectly cooked and preserved food which only requires heating to serve.\nLouis Pasteur, who probably saved your life. Paul Nadar, Public domain.\nCanning and bottling then have solved food preservation, but only for cooked food. Foodstuffs such as milk or juice dont survive the process very well, as they cook, and their taste and texture is altered. Think of the taste of condensed milk, for example, which doesnt quite make an acceptable substitute for fresh milk. And here we come to pasteurisation, the process of heating to a lower temperature for long enough to deactivate bacteria but not long or hot enough to cook the foodstuff. Its the invention of the French biologist Louis Pasteur, and though we now associate it with milk, it was devised to stop wine from spoiling as it aged.\nThe beauty of pasteurisation is that it does not require specialised machinery to work; while its achieved commercially by passing the milk through steam-heated pipes, it can even be done in a saucepan on a domestic stove. The aim is to heat it as hot as possible without cooking the milk, and the exact temperature depends on for how long it will be heated. The result isnt the sterility of a high-temperature canned food, but the active bacteria have been removed and its shelf life increased significantly. My experience with the process comes from home-pressed apple juice, and the figure I remember was 67 Celcius, the exceeding of which would impart an apple sauce taste to the final product.\nPasteurisation then is a major contributor to our public health. Far from bring a process somehow denying the kids a more wholesome food, its one of the reasons why many of the diseases that haunted our great-grandparents generation are now just names in print. Examining the process has provided a window into the perception of food though, as someone who did grow up on straight-from-the-cow unpasteurised milk did I have a better start in life? Probably not, but it did give me a keen sense of smell for soured cream.\nHeader image: Agriculture And Stock Department, Information Branch, Photography Section, Public domain.", "title": "\u904e\u53bb\u3092\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5371\u967a", "body": "\u7530\u820e\u306e\u5b50\u4f9b\u304c\u90fd\u4f1a\u306e\u5b50\u4f9b\u3088\u308a\u514d\u75ab\u529b\u304c\u5f37\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u3088\u304f\u5f15\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u8a00\u8449\u3002\u98df\u54c1\u306e\u65b0\u9bae\u3055\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u305a\u3001\u98df\u54c1\u4fdd\u5b58\u6cd5\u3082\u53e4\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5371\u967a\u3067\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u52a0\u5de5\u98df\u54c1\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8003\u616e\u3059\u3079\u304d\u3002\u725b\u4e73\u306e\u4fdd\u5b58\u6cd5\u3084\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u89b3\u5ff5\u306a\u3069\u3082\u8b70\u8ad6\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u904e\u53bb\u3092\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5371\u967a", "\u98df\u54c1\u4fdd\u5b58\u3068\u30d1\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba", "\u98df\u54c1\u4fdd\u5b58: \u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u73fe\u5728\u3078", "\u30eb\u30a4\u30fb\u30d1\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u98df\u54c1\u4fdd\u5b58", "\u30d1\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba: \u98df\u54c1\u306e\u4fdd\u5b58\u3068\u516c\u8846\u885b\u751f"]}

Maybe its to lock cams together for a timing belt change, or to work as a jig for soldering some complex device. However, some hacks are even simpler than that. [maker_guy] realized that eating nuggets in the car could be easier than ever with a little printed adapter.\nThe print is simple. Its a round caddy for the nugget sauces given out by Chick-fil-A restaurants. Why round? Because it lets the nugget sauce sit neatly in your cars cupholder at an accessible height. Put the sauce tub in the adapter, peel it open, and you can dip to your hearts content.\nSo simple, yet a game changer all the same.\nNo more delicately balancing Zesty Buffalo by the gearstick while you try and chow down. Nor will your seat covers be tainted with Honey Mustard!\nNot a hack! you scream. Its frivolous nonsense! To that I say, are you a nugget eater or not? I myself partake, and I can absolutely see the value in this. You see, us journalists work hard. Were often stuck eating substandard food in our cars on the way from one thing to another, like so many others in busy professions. If a smart little 3D-printed adapter can make mealtime easier and save some mess, Im calling that a win.\nYou should never be afraid to use your creativity to make tools to improve your life. Parts are on Thingiverse if you need to print your own. Mod it to suit McDonalds product if you need. Heck, print in black and itd look like a stock part of the car!\nYou dont have to like this simple adapter, but you cant deny its utility!

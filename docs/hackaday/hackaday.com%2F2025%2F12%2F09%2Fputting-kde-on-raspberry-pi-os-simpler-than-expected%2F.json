In case you ever idly wondered about giving your speedy Pi a better UI, [Luc]/[lucstechblog] wants to remind you that setting up KDE on your Raspberry OS install is dead simple and requires only about a dozen commandline steps.\n[Luc] walks you through these dozen steps, from installation to switching the default DE, and the few hangups you might expect after the switch; if you want to free up some disk space afterwards, [Luc] shows how to get rid of the original LXDE packages. Got the latest Trixie-based Pi OS? Theres an update post detailing the few necessary changes, as well as talking about others experiences with the switch.\nAll in all, [Luc] demonstrates that KDE will have a fair bit of graphical and UX advantages, while operating only a little slower, and if you werent really using your powerful Pi to the fullest, its a worthwhile visual and usability upgrade. For the regular desktop users, KDE has recently released their own distro, and our own [Jenny] has taken a look at it.", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u306bKDE\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u306bKDE\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u8996\u899a\u7684\u306a\u5229\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3082\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u306bKDE\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdRaspberry Pi\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eUI\u6539\u5584", "Raspberry OS\u306eLXDE\u304b\u3089KDE\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308bRaspberry Pi\u7528KDE\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "Raspberry Pi\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068KDE\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

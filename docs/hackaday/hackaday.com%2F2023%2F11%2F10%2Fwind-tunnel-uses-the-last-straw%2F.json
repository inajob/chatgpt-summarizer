Just a fan and a tunnel, right? The truth is theres a lot more to it than that, and [ejs13] shows you how you can make a small tunnel with some basic supplies. One of the requirements for a useful tunnel is to have laminar flow  that is, flow in uniform layers with little, if any, mixing. This tunnel achieves laminar flow using an array of soda straws to direct the flow. In fact, there are 150 straws in total. You can see a short clip of the wind tunnel in action below.\nThe rest of the parts are easy, too. A computer fan provides wind, and theres a little bit of wood and acrylic. Youll notice in the video that you can easily see the airflow. Thats thanks to a light source, some water, and a bit of dry ice.\n\nWe imagine you can scale this design up with bigger fans and, of course, more straws. The acrylic is to provide a window so you can see inside. Glass would probably work, too. Overall, this would make a great class project, along with creating some wings or small models of planes or cars.\nWeve seen similar laminar flow setups but not using soda straws. Just what you need to test out that paper airplane design youve had in your head.\n"}

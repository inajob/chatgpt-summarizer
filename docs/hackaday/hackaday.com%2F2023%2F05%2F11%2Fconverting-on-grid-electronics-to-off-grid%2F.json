If youre not aware of them, they documented their journey on their YouTube channel, showing many interesting skills and hacks along the way. The video were highlighting today shows a myriad of ways to power all the DC-consuming gadgets this they lug along with them.\nLiFePO4 batteries are far superior to lead acid for mobile solar installations.\nTheir heavily modded F-550 truck houses 12kWh of LiFePO4 batteries and a 1.5kW retractable solar array, with a hefty inverter generating the needed AC power. They werent too happy with the conversion losses from piles of wall warts that all drained a little power, knowing that the inverter that fed them was also not 100% efficient. For example, a typical laptop power brick gets really hot in a short time, and that heat is waste. They decided to run as much as possible direct from the battery bank, through different DC-DC converter modules in an attempt to streamline the losses a little. Obviously, these are also not 100%\nHome, sorry, truck automation system\nefficient, but keeping the load off the inverter (and thus reducing dependency upon it, in the event of another failure) should help stem the losses a little. After all as [Jason] says, Watts saved are Watts earned, and all the little lossy loads add up to a considerable parasitic drain.\nOne illustration of this is their Starlink satellite internet system consumes about 60W when running from the inverter, but only 28W when running direct from DC. Over the course of 24 hours, thats not far off 1kWh of savings, and if the sun isnt shining, then that 12kWh battery isnt going to stretch as far.\nThere are far too many hacks, tips, and illustrations of neat space and power-saving solutions everywhere, to write here. Those interested in self-build campers or hacking a commercial unit may pick up a trick or two.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith] for the tip!", "title": "\u300c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u96fb\u6c60\u300d\u3067\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\uff01\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fcDIY\u306e\u69d8\u5b50 ", "body": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u51fa\u8eab\u306e\u592b\u59bb\u304c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u3067\u65c5\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3001LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30681.5 kW\u306e\u53ef\u7e2e\u6027\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u6539\u9020\u6e08\u307f\u306eF-550\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b12kWh\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066DC-DC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001AC\u96fb\u6e90\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u640d\u5931\u3092\u524a\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308b\u63d0\u6848\u3082\u591a\u6570\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u96fb\u6c60\u300d\u3067\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\uff01\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fcDIY\u306e\u69d8\u5b50 ", "\u53b3\u9078\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u5145\u96fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff01\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3067\u306e\u300cDC\u300d\u6d3b\u7528\u8853 ", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fcDIY\u3067\u524a\u6e1b\uff01\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u591a\u3044\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u983c\u3089\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5 ", "\u7d04\u534a\u5206\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\uff01\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u885b\u661f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306eDC\u5229\u7528\u8853 ", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\uff01\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u7701\u30a8\u30cd\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb"]}

But theres at least one generation that thinks TVs and computer monitors are flat. If that describes you, you might enjoy [The 8-Bit Guys] coverage of how CRTs work in the video below.\nCRTs were heavy, took high voltage, and had a dangerous vacuum inside, so we really dont miss them. The phosphor on the screen had a tendency to burn in if you showed the same image over and over. We dont miss that either.\n\nThe basic idea is simple. An electron is fired at the phosphor behind the screen. An electrostatic or electromagnetic arrangement allows you to hit specific spots on the screen, and, of course, you can turn the beam off. Color CRTs have three different phosphors, and the beams have to fire at the correct color phosphor.\nThe best part of the video is the part where they tear apart an actual CRT, something you dont see very often. We were worried about the vacuum, but the tube in question had already vented to atmosphere.\nWe doubt CRTs will make a comeback like vinyl records have. If so, maybe youll settle for a software simulation. It does make retrocomputing simulators feel better.\n"}

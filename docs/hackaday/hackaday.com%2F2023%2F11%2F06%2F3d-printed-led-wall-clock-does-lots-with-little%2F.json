The blue shows the minutes, made more discrete by a grid inside the ring. The green shows the hours.\u00a0 [Alf] has provided the code so you can rework the color scheme.\u00a0 It might be interesting to add seconds with the red LEDs, or perhaps a countdown triggered by a touch sensor\n\nThe clock is built from two Adafruit Neopixel rings, each with 60 LEDs. These are mounted on a 3D-printed shield that directs and softens the light to create the time elements. It is all driven by an ESP8266 controller, running a program that grabs the time from an NTP server and translates that into LEDs. The code is provided, and [Alf] has documented it nicely so you can easily change the time zone, colors, or other elements.\nThis does remind us of [andrei erdei]s time strip clock, but it is a bit easier to read."}

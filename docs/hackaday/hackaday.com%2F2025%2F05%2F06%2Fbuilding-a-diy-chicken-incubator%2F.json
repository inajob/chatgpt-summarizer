You could buy one off the shelf, but theyre not so complex  just a nicely-controlled warm box you could easily whip up yourself. As it turns out, thats precisely what [RCLifeOn] did.\u00a0\nThe incubator is built out of wooden panels screwed together to make a simple box. The frame of the front door is also wood, but it features 3D printed hinges and handles, because thats the easiest way to make hardware when youre a printing wizard like [RCLifeOn].\nThe box is fitted with controls for humidity and temperature to ensure the best possible conditions for hatching chicken eggs inside. As you might have guessed, a heated bed from a 3D printer was used to control the temperature inside. As for humidity, a sensor tracks the conditions in the box, and triggers an ultrasonic mister to increase the level as necessary. Theres also a little motion introduced via a moving platform run by a motor and some step-down gearing, which apparently aids in the hatching process.\n[RCLifeOn] calls it a machine that creates life, and that honestly sounds about fair. Weve seen similar projects along these lines before, too.\n\n\n[Thanks to Chris Muncy for the tip!]"}

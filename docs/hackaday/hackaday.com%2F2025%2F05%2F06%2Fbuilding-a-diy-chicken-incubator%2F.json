You could buy one off the shelf, but theyre not so complex  just a nicely-controlled warm box you could easily whip up yourself. As it turns out, thats precisely what [RCLifeOn] did.\u00a0\nThe incubator is built out of wooden panels screwed together to make a simple box. The frame of the front door is also wood, but it features 3D printed hinges and handles, because thats the easiest way to make hardware when youre a printing wizard like [RCLifeOn].\nThe box is fitted with controls for humidity and temperature to ensure the best possible conditions for hatching chicken eggs inside. As you might have guessed, a heated bed from a 3D printer was used to control the temperature inside. As for humidity, a sensor tracks the conditions in the box, and triggers an ultrasonic mister to increase the level as necessary. Theres also a little motion introduced via a moving platform run by a motor and some step-down gearing, which apparently aids in the hatching process.\n[RCLifeOn] calls it a machine that creates life, and that honestly sounds about fair. Weve seen similar projects along these lines before, too.\n\n\n[Thanks to Chris Muncy for the tip!]", "title": "- DIY\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u5375\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u308b\u6e29\u7bb1", "body": "\u5375\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u5375\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u308b\u6e29\u7bb1", "- \u6728\u6750\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u6e29\u5ea6\u3068\u6e7f\u5ea6\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u5375\u5b75\u5316\u6a5f\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u751f\u547d\u3092\u80b2\u3080\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u5375\u5b75\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

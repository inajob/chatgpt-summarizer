Back in those days, they were a favorite tool of the KGB  allowing spies to listen in on what was being said in a room from a safe distance. This project by [SomethingAbtScience] resurrects that concept with a DIY build that any hacker worth their soldering iron can whip up on a modest budget. And lets face it, few things are cooler than turning a distant window into a microphone.\nAt its core this hack shines a laser on a window, detects the reflected light, and picks up subtle vibrations caused by conversations inside the room. [SomethingAbtScience] uses an ordinary red laser (visible, because YouTube rules) and repurposes an amplifier circuit ripped from an old mic, swapping the capsule for a photodiode. The build is elegant in its simplicity, but what really makes it shine is the attention to detail: adding a polarizing filter to cut ambient noise and 3D printing a stabilized sensor mount. The output is still a bit noisy, but with some fine tuning  and perhaps a second sensor for differential analysis  theres potential for crystal-clear audio reconstruction. Just dont expect it to pass MI6 quality control.\nWhile you probably wont be spying on diplomats anytime soon, this project is a fascinating glimpse into a bygone era of physical surveillance. Its also a reminder of how much can be accomplished with a laser pointer, some ingenuity, and the curiosity to see how far a signal can travel.\n\n"}

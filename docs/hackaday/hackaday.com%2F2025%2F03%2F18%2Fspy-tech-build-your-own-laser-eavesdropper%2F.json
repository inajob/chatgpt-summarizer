Back in those days, they were a favorite tool of the KGB  allowing spies to listen in on what was being said in a room from a safe distance. This project by [SomethingAbtScience] resurrects that concept with a DIY build that any hacker worth their soldering iron can whip up on a modest budget. And lets face it, few things are cooler than turning a distant window into a microphone.\nAt its core this hack shines a laser on a window, detects the reflected light, and picks up subtle vibrations caused by conversations inside the room. [SomethingAbtScience] uses an ordinary red laser (visible, because YouTube rules) and repurposes an amplifier circuit ripped from an old mic, swapping the capsule for a photodiode. The build is elegant in its simplicity, but what really makes it shine is the attention to detail: adding a polarizing filter to cut ambient noise and 3D printing a stabilized sensor mount. The output is still a bit noisy, but with some fine tuning  and perhaps a second sensor for differential analysis  theres potential for crystal-clear audio reconstruction. Just dont expect it to pass MI6 quality control.\nWhile you probably wont be spying on diplomats anytime soon, this project is a fascinating glimpse into a bygone era of physical surveillance. Its also a reminder of how much can be accomplished with a laser pointer, some ingenuity, and the curiosity to see how far a signal can travel.\n\n", "title": "- DIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u8ddd\u96e2\u306e\u3042\u308b\u97f3\u3092\u62fe\u3046\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u9053\u5177\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u7a93\u3092\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u74b0\u5883\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u76e3\u8996\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

Burning them also takes carbon out of the ground and puts it into the atmosphere, with undesirable climate implications. The hunt for a solution has been on for quite some time.\nVarious synthetic fuels have been proposed as a solution, wherein carbon dioxide is captured from the air and chemically processed into useful fuel. Done properly, this could solve the climate issue where any fuel burned has its carbon later captured to make more fuel. The problem, though, is that this process is very energy intensive. Given the demands, its no surprise that some are looking towards nuclear reactors for the answer.\n\nHot To Go\nSynthetic fuels are typically designed to replace conventional gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel.

Fossil fuels are perfect for this application because they pack a huge amount of energy into very little space while weighing relatively little to boot. At the same time, more than a third of global carbon emissions in 2021 came from transportation, according to the International Energy Agency. While electric vehicles are rapidly gaining market share in some areas, the complete phase out of internal combustion engines is by no means a sure thing. Meanwhile, sectors like aviation are proving especially difficult to fully electrify. We want to get off fossil fuels, but circumstances demand we continue to use them.\nEnter synthetic fuels. Theyre essentially drop-in replacements for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel that are produced from CO2, water and clean energy rather than being refined from petroleum. When made using captured CO2 and cleanly-produced hydrogen, they have the potential to significantly reduce transport emissions when taking the whole system into account. All this, without requiring an entirely new fueling infrastructure or any changes for the end user.\nBy capturing carbon and then chemically processing it into a useful combustible fuel, we could keep using existing technologies that we already find practical, like combustion-engined vehicles. Their emissions would still be undesirable, but theyd be offset by the capture process used to make new fuel. The idea is to create a closed loop for carbon emissions.\u00a0 The problem is finding a synfuel production process thats efficient\u2014both in terms of carbon capture and chemical processing\u2014and to find the energy to run it.\nIndeed, synthesizing hydrocarbons is an energy-intensive process. The process is well-understood at this point. Capturing CO2 from the air, generating hydrogen via electrolysis, and catalytically combining them into fuels at high temperatures and pressures all require a lot of energy input. For synfuels to deliver real climate benefits, this energy must come from clean, non-fossil sources.\nThe Department of Energy has a strong interest in nuclear synfuel production.

Several U.S. Department of Energy labs are actively researching nuclear-powered synfuel production, and the DOE is funding a $20 million demonstration project in Utah. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the Nuclear Industry Association has been urging the country to seize a leadership position in this emerging field as well.\nOn a very basic level, a conventional nuclear power plant could provide electricity for various processes involved in synthetic fuel production. However, thats not the only way to go. For some processes, the heat from a nuclear reactor could be directly used to power the synfuel production process. That is, rather than using heat from a nuclear reaction to create steam to turn a turbine, a purpose-built synfuel reactor could just deliver heat directly to a chemical process that needs it. Nuclear heat could be useful for desalinating seawater for hydrogen electrolysis, or for carbon capture, too.\nThe chemistry involved in synfuel production is well understood. The problem is figuring out how to do it cheaply enough to be competitive with fossil fuels, while using clean sources of CO2 and hydrogen. Credit: Argonne National Laboratory\nThe question is whether all the effort will be worthwhile. Competing with regular old fossil fuels on price will be a must, even if some degree of subsidy is used to lean the scales in the favor of synfuels. There are hopes that nuclear-produced synfuels could reach prices of $3 a gallon with the right feedstocks and input costs, but thats words on a page at this stage. There is plenty of engineering to be done before youll be filling your car with 20 gallons of nuke gas at your local station.\nEfficiency also comes into it, and this could play a big role in how synfuels pan out. Take cars, for example.\u00a0 Automakers have figured out how to make supremely efficient electric vehicles in the past decade. Electrical engineers have become experts at squirting power efficiently all over the country, and there are more EV charging stations than ever. Does it make sense to spin up bespoke nuclear synfuel plants to keep internal combustion alive, when the technology to replace it already exists? Arguments could be made for more demanding applications like trucking or aviation, but then the market for synfuels grows smaller.\nSynthetic fuels are particularly attractive for the aviation industry, which has found electrification hard to achieve due to the limits of battery technology. Credit: US Air Force, public domain\nIn any case, nuclear synfuel holds great promise. Whether it can overcome the general resistance towards all nuclear technologies remains to be seen. Still, the tides may be changing on that front, and the future is anyones guess. If youre a fan of fossil fuels and the like, be happy\u2014there is hope yet that the flammable fluid market will roll on."}

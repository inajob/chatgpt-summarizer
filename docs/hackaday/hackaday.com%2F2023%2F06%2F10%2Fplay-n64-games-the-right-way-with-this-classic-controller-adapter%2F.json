Nintendos tendency to completely reinvent their controllers pretty much every generation can therefore become a little irritating, especially when they also enable their newer consoles to play games from their back catalog. So when [Robson Couto] found that using the Switchs Joy-Cons was a bit awkward for playing emulated Nintendo 64 games, he decided to figure out how to connect real N64 controllers to a Nintendo Switch.\nWhile you can buy modern N64-style controllers for the Switch, even straight from Nintendo themselves, [Robson] thought it would be way more interesting to reuse an old controller and implement the translation step from scratch. In the video (embedded below) he takes a deep dive into all the timing details of the N64 controller protocol, which is basically a 1-wire setup, and explains how to use an STM32F411 BlackPill board to read out the controllers buttons and joystick.\nNext, he explores how to map the resulting data to the USB HID protocol used by the Switch. Most of the buttons have a clear one-on-one mapping, but since the minus, capture and home buttons are missing on the N64 controller, he chose to map these to button combinations unlikely to be used during regular gameplay. [Robson] also ran into the common issue of the analog joystick having a poorly-defined maximum range, for which he added a rudimentary auto-calibration feature.\nFinally, he designed and 3D-printed a neat enclosure for his system with an N64 controller port on one side and a USB port on the other. By 3D-printing the whole thing he also avoided having to either source the non-standard connector or permanently modify his hardware. The end result of [Robson]s project is an unobtrusive gadget that connects classic controllers to modern hardware  but of course, the reverse process is very much possible, too. If you want, you can even play N64 games with a mouse and keyboard.\n\n", "title": "Nintendo Switch\u306bN64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u300cNintendo Switch\u300d\u3067\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305fN64\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u904a\u3076\u969b\u3001\u672c\u6765\u306eN64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3067\u304d\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001STM32F411 BlackPill\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066N64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3084\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3001USB HID\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3067Switch\u306b\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3059\u308b\u3002\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30b9\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3089\u3092\u901a\u5e38\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3067\u5272\u308a\u5f53\u3066\u308b\u306a\u3069\u3001\u6311\u6226\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Nintendo Switch\u306bN64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "N64\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306eJoy-Con\u4f7f\u7528\u304c\u9055\u548c\u611f\u3092\u611f\u3058\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u3044N64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066Nintendo Switch\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "STM32F411 BlackPill board\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066N64\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

Its the IBM 701c, the famous Butterfly laptop, whose fold-out keyboard still gives it star\u00a0 quality, and [John Graham-Cumming] has documented the restoration of one from the tattered remains of two scrap examples.\nThe two laptops in question were someone elses never-started project, and were in a sorry state. The flexible cables were in poor condition, and the 1990s Ni-MH batteries had leaked and damaged both circuits and case. We were unaware that NiMH leakage could damage plastic, but the parts of these machines were significantly damaged.\nOne had a working mainboard, the other a working modem card. One keyboard was in pretty bad shape, the other was complete. Of the pair there was a double super twisted nematic (DSTN) display and a more contemporary thin film transistor (TFT) panel. Be thankful if you have never had to use a DSTN laptop, as they were truly awful. From this pile of parts a working machine could be made, and with a new CMOS battery, that cable repair, and a repaint, he was ready. Or at least, as he says, ready for 1995.\nThis isnt the first 701c restoration weve seen, and within reason, its even possible to give them a retro processor upgrade.", "title": "\u300cIBM 701c Butterfly \u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "IBM 701c\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u8a18\u9332\u304c\u3042\u308a\u30012\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u914d\u7dda\u304c\u60aa\u304f\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6f0f\u6d29\u3067\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u640d\u50b7\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u5857\u88c5\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cIBM 701c Butterfly \u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aIBM 701c\u306e\u4f8b\u300d", "\u300c\u30bf\u30bf\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u540d\u6a5f\uff1aIBM 701c Butterfly\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u300d", "\u300c1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u4fee\u7406\uff1aIBM 701c\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3068\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u300d", "\u300c\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u518d\u751f\uff1aIBM 701c Butterfly\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30fb\u6539\u826f\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d"]}

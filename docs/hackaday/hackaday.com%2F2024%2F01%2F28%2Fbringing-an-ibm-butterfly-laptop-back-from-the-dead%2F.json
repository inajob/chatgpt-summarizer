Its the IBM 701c, the famous Butterfly laptop, whose fold-out keyboard still gives it star\u00a0 quality, and [John Graham-Cumming] has documented the restoration of one from the tattered remains of two scrap examples.\nThe two laptops in question were someone elses never-started project, and were in a sorry state. The flexible cables were in poor condition, and the 1990s Ni-MH batteries had leaked and damaged both circuits and case. We were unaware that NiMH leakage could damage plastic, but the parts of these machines were significantly damaged.\nOne had a working mainboard, the other a working modem card. One keyboard was in pretty bad shape, the other was complete. Of the pair there was a double super twisted nematic (DSTN) display and a more contemporary thin film transistor (TFT) panel. Be thankful if you have never had to use a DSTN laptop, as they were truly awful. From this pile of parts a working machine could be made, and with a new CMOS battery, that cable repair, and a repaint, he was ready. Or at least, as he says, ready for 1995.\nThis isnt the first 701c restoration weve seen, and within reason, its even possible to give them a retro processor upgrade."}

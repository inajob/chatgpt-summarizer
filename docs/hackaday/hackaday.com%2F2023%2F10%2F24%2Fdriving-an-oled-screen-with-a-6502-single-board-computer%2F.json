These days, little OLEDs can be had for a few bucks and theyve taken the maker world by storm. [Anders Nielsen] has recently been experimenting with driving these displays from the vintage 6502 CPU, and hes even got scrolling operation down pat.\nThe best part is that [Nielsen] is doing all this on a single-board computer running his own assembly code. Thats right  theres no compilers here. Its bare metal coding at its best. The build uses a 6507 chip running at 1 MHz, paired with a 6532 RIOT and just 128 bytes of RAM\u2014a similar setup to the Atari 2600.\nThe video explains how the code stacks up and drives the display, achieving the scrolling effect. It makes a huge difference to usability, especially compared to chunking pages at a time to the postage stamp-sized screen. He demonstrates a legitimate usage case too, using the setup as a serial terminal for a Raspberry Pi.\nThe 6502 architecture still looms large in the collective consciousness; weve been talking about programming it in assembly for years. Video after the break.\n\n"}

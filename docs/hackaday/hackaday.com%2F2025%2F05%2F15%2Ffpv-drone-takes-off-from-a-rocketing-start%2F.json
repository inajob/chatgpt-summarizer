That is exactly what [I Build Stuff] thought when attempting to build a self-landing payload. The idea is to release a can sized \u201csatellite\u201d from a rocket at an altitude upwards of 1 km, which will then fly back down to the launch point.\nThe device itself is a first-person view (FPV) drone running the popular Betaflight firmware. With arms that swing out with some of the smallest brushless motors you\u2019ve ever seen (albeit not the smallest motor), the satellite is surprisingly capable. Unfortunately due to concerns over the legality of an autonomous payload, the drone is human controlled on the descent.\nUsing collaborated efforts, a successful launch was flown with the satellite making it to the ground unharmed, at least for the most part. While the device did show capabilities of being able to fly back, human error led to a manual recovery. Of course, this is far from the only rocketry hack we have seen here at Hackaday. If you are more into making the flight itself interesting, here is a record breaking one from USC students.\n\n\nThank you [Hari Wiguna] for the great tip!"}

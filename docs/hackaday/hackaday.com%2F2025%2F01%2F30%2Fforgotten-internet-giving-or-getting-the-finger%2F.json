If you want to find out more about him, youd probably go surf LinkedIn or maybe a social media site. Inside a company, you might look on instant messaging for a profile and even find out if he is at his desk or away. But back in the 1970s, those werent options. But if Marco was on the computer system, maybe you could finger him. While that sounds strange to say today, Finger was a common service provided by computer services at the time. It was like a LinkedIn profile page for the 1970s.\nBased on RFC 742, Finger was the brainchild for [Les Earnest]. From a users point of view, you put a few files in your home directory (usually .project and .plan; both hidden files), and when someone fingered you, theyd see some human-friendly output about your account like your name and office location, if you were logged in or not, and the contents of your project and plan files.\nModern versions may also show your public PGP key and other data. You could usually put a file in your home directory called .nofinger if you wanted to stop people from fingering you.\n\nUnder the Covers\nBehind the scenes, finger worked with a daemon on port 79 that handled TCP requests. By 1991, RFC 1288 defined the protocol in more detail. Since it was a network service, you could finger people on other computers as long as port 79 was open.\nThings were pretty freeform, so while some people had information in their plan files, others had jokes or even ASCII graphics. Most people didnt know about them and ended up with the defaults.\nWhy Finger?\nThis PDP-10 surely was running a finger service. (photo CC-BY-4.0 by [Gah4])You might wonder why this was called finger. We always thought it was like the old mobster movies (he put the finger on Lenny). But it turns out, [Les] noted people using their fingers to trace through the verbose output of WHO command on WAITS, which was based on the operating system later known as TOPS-10, a common operating system on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers.\nIncidentally, [Les] was the same guy who developed the SAIL keyboard that, as far as we know, introduced the META key you hear about in Emacs.\nCutting Off Finger\nFinger is from a simpler time when you could assume people werent trying to hack into your system. Of course, they are. In 1988, the Morris worm exploited fingerd  the finger daemon  to spread itself among systems.\nBetween better alternatives, security concerns, and a general lack of awareness among new users, the writing was on the wall. Today, it is hard to find a system that provides finger services.\nYou could install finger, but we dont recommend you keep it running for long. Ubuntus package manager, at least, will let you install both finger and fingerd easily.\nRunning finger with no arguments will show you a list of logged in users. Usually, youd use it with a user ID, though:\n$ finger alw \nLogin: alw \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Name: Al Williams \nDirectory: /home/alw \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shell: /bin/bash \nOn since Sun Jan 12 13:51 (CST) on tty2 from :0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a019 days 19 hours idle \nOn since Sun Jan 12 13:51 (CST) on pts/0 from :0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a016 days 21 hours idle \nOn since Sun Jan 12 13:52 (CST) on pts/2 from tmux(1721804).%1 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02 seconds idle \n. . .\nOn since Wed Jan 15 13:48 (CST) on pts/7 from tmux(1721804).%4 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a013 days 21 hours idle \nOn since Fri Jan 17 11:40 (CST) on pts/11 from :0 \n\u00a0\u00a011 days 23 hours idle \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(messages off) \nNo mail. \nPlan: \nWrite more Hackaday!\nSounds like a good plan.\nIn the 1980s, it seemed like finger would be around forever.

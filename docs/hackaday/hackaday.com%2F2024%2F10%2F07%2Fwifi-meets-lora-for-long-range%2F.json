Researchers in China have been doing this, and they call the result WiLo. They claim to get reliable connections over about half a kilometer. Typical WiFi runs 40 to 60 meters, barring any Pringles cans or other exotic tricks.\nAccording to [Michelle Hampson] writing in IEEE Spectrum, the researchers manipulated Wi-Fi\u2019s OFDM multiplexing to emulate LoRa\u2019s chirp-spreading signal. The advantage is that existing WiFi hardware can use the protocol to increase range.\n\nWhile LoRa is known for being economical with power, this might not be the case with repurposed WiFi devices. The researchers plan to explore ways to make WiLo more energy efficient. You can read the research paper if you want to dig into the details.\nThere are also some efficiency issues. The WiFi header, trailer, and preamble cant contribute to the fake LoRa signal, so they are ignored by the LoRa receiver. We arent sure, but we wondered if some or most WiFi cards are now based on SDR technology anyway. If you had the internal details of the SDR, it seems like you could simply reprogram the entire unit to do whatever protocol you wanted. Still, those details are probably hard to obtain.\nLoRa seems prime for hacking. Of course, 500 meters is just the tip of the iceberg.", "title": "WiFi\u3068LoRa\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305fWiLo\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "body": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304cWiFi\u3068LoRa\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305fWiLo\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3001\u534a\uff4b\uff4d\u306e\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002\u65e2\u5b58\u306eWiFi\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3002\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8ab2\u984c\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u7701\u30a8\u30cd\u5316\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002LoRa\u306f\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u306b\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["WiFi\u3068LoRa\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305fWiLo\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30ebWiLo", "WiFi\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5229\u7528\u3067\u901a\u4fe1\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u62e1\u5927", "\u96fb\u529b\u52b9\u7387\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059WiLo\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "LoRa\u3068WiFi\u306e\u878d\u5408\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

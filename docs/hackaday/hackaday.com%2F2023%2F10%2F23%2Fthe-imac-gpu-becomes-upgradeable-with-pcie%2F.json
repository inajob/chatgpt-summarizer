They look pretty, but is there anything that can be done to upgrade them? Maybe not todays ones, but the models from the mid-2000s can be given some surprising new life. [LowEndMac] have featured a 2006 24 model thats received a much more powerful GPU, something wed have thought to be impossible.\nThe iMacs from that era resemble a monitor with a slightly chunkier back, in which resides the guts of the computer. By then the company was producing machines with an x86 processor, and their internals share a lot of similarities with a laptop of the period. The card is a Mac Radeon model newer than the machine would ever be used with, and it sits in a chain of mini PCIe to PCIe adapters. Even then it cant drive the original screen, so a replacement panel and power supply are taken from another monitor and grafted into the iMac case. This along with a RAM and SSD upgrade makes this about the most upgraded a 2006 iMac could be.\nOf course, another approach is to simply replace the whole lot with an Intel NUC.", "title": "\"iMac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u53ef\u80fd\uff012006\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044GPU\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "body": "2006\u5e74\u306eiMac\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306aGPU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30012006\u5e74\u306eiMac\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5225\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066Intel NUC\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"iMac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u53ef\u80fd\uff012006\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044GPU\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"2006\u5e74\u306eiMac\u304c\u9a5a\u304f\u307b\u3069\u9032\u5316\uff01RAM\u3068SSD\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\"", "\"iMac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u30672006\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\"", "\"\u53e4\u3044iMac\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u3078\uff01Intel NUC\u3067\u5b8c\u5168\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"iMac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u65b0\u3057\u3044GPU\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\""]}

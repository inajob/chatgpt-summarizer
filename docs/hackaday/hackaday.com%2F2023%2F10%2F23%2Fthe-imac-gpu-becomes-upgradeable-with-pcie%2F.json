They look pretty, but is there anything that can be done to upgrade them? Maybe not todays ones, but the models from the mid-2000s can be given some surprising new life. [LowEndMac] have featured a 2006 24 model thats received a much more powerful GPU, something wed have thought to be impossible.\nThe iMacs from that era resemble a monitor with a slightly chunkier back, in which resides the guts of the computer. By then the company was producing machines with an x86 processor, and their internals share a lot of similarities with a laptop of the period. The card is a Mac Radeon model newer than the machine would ever be used with, and it sits in a chain of mini PCIe to PCIe adapters. Even then it cant drive the original screen, so a replacement panel and power supply are taken from another monitor and grafted into the iMac case. This along with a RAM and SSD upgrade makes this about the most upgraded a 2006 iMac could be.\nOf course, another approach is to simply replace the whole lot with an Intel NUC."}

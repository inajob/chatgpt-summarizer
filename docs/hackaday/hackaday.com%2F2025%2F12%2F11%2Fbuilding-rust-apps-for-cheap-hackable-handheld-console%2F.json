How about a 20 EUR handheld game console intended for retro game emulation, that runs Linux under the hood? [Luiz Ferreira] kicks the tires of a R36S, a very popular and often cloned device running a quad-core RK3326 with an Ubuntu-based OS, and shows us how to write and cross-compile a simple app for it using Rust  even if you daily drive Windows.\nSince a fair bit of the underlying Linux OS is exposed, you can quickly build even text applications and have them run on the console. For instance, [Luiz]s app uses ratatui to scan then print button and joystick states to the screen. Perhaps the most important thing about this app is that its a detailed tutorial on cross-compiling Rust apps for a Linux target, and it runs wonders using WSL, too.\nInstalling your app is simple, too: SSH into it, username ark and password ark. Looking for a Linux-powered device with a bright screen, WiFi, a fair few rugged buttons, and an OS open for exploration? This one is quite reassuring in the age of usual portables like smartphones getting more and more closed-off to tinkering. And, if the store-bought hackable Linux consoles still arent enough, you can always step it up and build your own, reusing Joycons for your input needs while at it.", "title": "- 20\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7528\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "body": "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eLinux\u642d\u8f09\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5fR36S\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3068\u3001Rust\u3067\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u958b\u767a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- 20\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7528\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "- R36S\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRust\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u5165\u9580", "- Linux OS\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3067\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u958b\u767a\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- SSH\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\uff1aR36S\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- Joycon\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

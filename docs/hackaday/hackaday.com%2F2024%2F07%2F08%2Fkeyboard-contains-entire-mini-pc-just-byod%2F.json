But this  this is something else entirely. Chinese PC maker Linglong have crammed an entire mini PC into a keyboard thats small enough to fit in your back pocket. Oh, and it folds, too. All you need is a display.\nWhy do you need a display? Why not include one, if youre going to wedge everything else in there? Well, the company envisions its users pairing it with a VR or AR glasses. But we can see use cases far beyond ownership of special spectacles, of course.\nFor instance, office work. Linglong says this key-puter (you read it here first) will last up to ten hours for light use, and nearly six hours for watching movies, but heavy use will have you down to four hours, which really isnt that bad.\nSpec-wise, it looks pretty good, with an AMD Ryzen 7 and either 16 or 32 GB of memory and a half- or full-terabyte hard drive. The whole thing is around 4 x 6 (15 x 10cm), presumably in the folded orientation, and weighs less than two pounds (800 g). The projected cost is $400-500 depending on specs.\nUnfortunately, this little key-puter isnt available just yet. There are just 200 units available for Beta testing, and no, we dont have one!\nMain and thumbnail images via Linglong", "title": "\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u6298\u308a\u7573\u307f\u53ef\u80fd\u30df\u30cbPC\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u307b\u3069\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3001\u30d5\u30eb\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u30df\u30cbPC\u304c\u5185\u8535\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002VR\u3084AR\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\u3092\u60f3\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u8efd\u3044\u4f7f\u7528\u306710\u6642\u9593\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5bff\u547d\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002AMD Ryzen 7\u308416-32GB\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30011TB\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u306f\u7d04$400-500\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u6298\u308a\u7573\u307f\u53ef\u80fd\u30df\u30cbPC\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u767b\u5834", "\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u3068\u9023\u643a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9PC\u306e\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Linglong\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9PC\u306f\u6700\u592710\u6642\u9593\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u99c6\u52d5", "AMD Ryzen 7\u306816-32GB\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9PC", "$400-500\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9PC"]}

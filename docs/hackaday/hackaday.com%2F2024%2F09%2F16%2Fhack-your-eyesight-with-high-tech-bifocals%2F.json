Thats just a fact of life. It is a rite of passage the first time you leave the eye doctor with a script for progressive lenses which are just fancy bifocals. However, a new high-tech version of bifocals promises you better vision, but with a slight drawback, as [Sherri L. Smith] found.\nRemember how users of Google Glass earned the nickname glassholes? Well, these new bifocals make Google Glass look like a fashion statement. If you are too young to need them, bifocals account for the fact that your eyes need different kinds of help when you look close up (like soldering) or far away (like at an antenna up on a roof). A true bifocal has two lenses and you quickly learn to look down at anything close up and up to see things far away. Progressives work the same, but they transition between the two settings instead of having a discrete mini lens at the bottom.\nThe new glasses, the ViXion01 change based on what you are looking for. They measure range and adjust accordingly. For $555, or a monthly rental, you can wear what looks like a prototype for a Star Trek visor and let it deduce what you are looking at and change its lenses accordingly.\nOf course, this takes batteries that last about ten hours. It also requires medical approval to be real glasses and it doesnt have that, yet. Honestly, if they worked well and didnt look so dorky, the real use case might be allowing your eye doctor to immediately download a new setting as your vision changes. How about you? How much odd headgear are you willing to wear in public and why?\nGlasses have a long strange history. While a university prototype we saw earlier was not likely to win fashion awards, they did look better than these.

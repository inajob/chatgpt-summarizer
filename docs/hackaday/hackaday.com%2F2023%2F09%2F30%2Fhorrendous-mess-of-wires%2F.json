When they\u2019re done? When they\u2019re to the basic prototype stage? Or all along the way, from their very conception? All of these have their merits, and their champions.\nIn the post-all-along-the-way corner, we have Hackaday\u2019s own [Arya Voronova], who outlines the many ways that you can start documenting your project before it\u2019s even a fully fledged project. She calls these tidbits \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d, and it strikes me as being a lot like keeping a logbook, but doing it in public. The advantages? Instead of just you, everyone on the Internet can see what you\u2019re up to. This means they can offer help, give you parts recommendations, and find that incorrect pinout that one pair of eyes would have missed. It takes a lot of courage to post your unfinished business for all to see, but ironically, that\u2019s the stage of the project where you stand to gain the most from the exposure.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum are the folks who document their projects at the very end. We see a ton of these on Hackaday.io and in people\u2019s personal blogs. It\u2019s a great service to the community, frankly, because at that point, you\u2019re already done with the project. This is the point where the reward, for you, is at its minimum, but it\u2019s also the point where you feel least inhibited about sharing if you\u2019re one of those people who are afraid of showing your work off half-done. The risk here, if you\u2019re like me, is that you\u2019re already on to the next project when one is \u201cdone\u201d, and going back over it to make notes seems superfluous. Those of you who do it regardless, we salute you!\nAnd then there\u2019s the middle ground. When you\u2019re about one third of the way done, you realize that you might have something half workable, and you start taking a photo or two, or maybe even typing words into a computer. Your git logs start to contain more than just \u201cfixed more stuff\u201d for each check-in, because what if someone else actually reads this? Maybe you\u2019re to the point where you\u2019ve just made the nice box to put it in, and you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll ever go back and untangle that rat\u2019s nest, so you take a couple of pictures of the innards before you hot glue it down.\nI\u2019m a little ashamed I\u2019m probably on the \u201cpost only when it\u2019s done\u201d end of things than is healthy, mostly because I don\u2019t have the aforementioned strength of will to go back.

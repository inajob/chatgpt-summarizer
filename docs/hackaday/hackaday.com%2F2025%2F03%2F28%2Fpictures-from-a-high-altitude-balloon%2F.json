Hams might guess SSTV  slow scan TV  and thats the approach [desafloinventor] took. If you havent seen it before (no pun intended), SSTV is a way to send images over radio at a low frame rate. Usually, you get about 30 seconds to 2 minutes per frame.\nThe setup uses regular, cheap walkie-talkies for the radio portion on a band that doesnt require a license. The ESP32-CAM provides the processing and image acquisition. Normally, you dont think of these radios as having a lot of range, but if the transmitter is high, the range will be very good. The project steals the board out of the radio to save weight. You only fly the PC board, not the entire radio.\nIf you are familiar with SSTV, the ESP-32 code encodes the image using Martin 1. This color format was developed by a ham named [Martin] (G3OQD). A 320256 image takes nearly two minutes to send. The balloon system sends every 10 minutes, so thats not a problem.\nOf course, this technique will work anywhere you want to send images over a communication medium. Hams use these SSTV formats even on noisy shortwave frequencies, so the protocols are robust.\nHams used SSTV to trade memes way before the Internet. Need to receive SSTV? No problem."}

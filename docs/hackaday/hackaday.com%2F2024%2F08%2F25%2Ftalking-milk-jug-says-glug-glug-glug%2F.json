Well, one day, Daddy made a glug-glug sound that delighted her, and he was inspired to build an entirely new milk jug that would make that special sound whenever it was turned over.\nIn order to keep the build relatively simple, [Franklinstein] used a sound module with an SD card and a tilt switch to activate it. Theres not much else to the build, really  just the usual suspects like a boost converter, a charging module, and a speaker, of course. In case you couldnt tell, the enclosure and the internal skid that the electronics assemble onto are 3D printed.\nThis is really cute, and [Franklinstein]s daughter seems to love it. Everything is available, including some nice instructions if you want to make one of your own. Be sure to check out the neat build video after the break.\nThe things we do for kids. Seriously.\n\n"}

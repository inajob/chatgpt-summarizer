In its era, nobody really cared about hooking up the Apple II to a VGA monitor, but these days, its far easier than sourcing an original monitor. The V2 Analog is a useful tool that will let you do just that, plus some other neat tricks, besides.\nAs demonstrated on Youtube by [Adrians Digital Basement], The V2 Analog is basically a slot-in video card for the Apple II, II+, and IIe. Its based upon the AppleII-VGA, which uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to snoop the 6502 CPU bus and copy the video memory. It then outputs a high-quality VGA signal that is far nicer than the usual composite output options.\nAs a bonus, the V2 Analog can be reconfigured to run as an emulated AppliCard Z80 expansion card instead. This card was originally intended to allow Apple II users to run CP/M applications. The V2 Analog does a great job in this role, though it bears noting it cant handle VGA output and Z80 emulation at the same time.\nProject files are available on Github for the curious. The Apple II may be long out of production, but its certainly not forgotten. Video after the break.\n\n"}

But we daresay thats overshadowed by the verbose image analysis, which describes the scene in its best David Attenborough impression.\nThis feline exemplifies both the beauty and the peaceful nature of its kind. No email will be sent as the cat is not on the kitchen counter.\nHard to believe that just a few years ago this cat detector tool was the bees knees in cat detection technology. Things have certainly come a long way. Interested? The GitHub repository has everything needed to roll your own and we highly recommend watching it in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n"}

In that spirit, [Darren Stone] created a video demonstrating how to model a twisted part in FreeCAD, showing the entire workflow of creating the part as a blend of surfaces and curves that get turned into a solid.\nFreeCAD is organized using the concept of multiple workbenches which are each optimized for different tools and operations, and [Darren] walks through doing the same jobs in a few different ways.\nThis twisted bracket is a simple part that is nevertheless nontrivial from a CAD perspective, and that makes it a good candidate for showing off the different workbenches and tools.\nThe video below is also pretty good overall demonstration of what designing a part from a mechanical drawing looks like when done in FreeCAD. As for mechanical drawings themselves, weve seen FreeCAD can be used to make those, too.\n\n"}

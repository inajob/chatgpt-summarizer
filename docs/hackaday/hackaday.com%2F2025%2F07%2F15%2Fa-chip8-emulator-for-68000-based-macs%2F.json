It was an interpreted virtual machine originally created for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer by [Joe Weisbecker] way back in 1977. It enabled coding simple games on the COSMAC VIP without getting into machine code on the VIPs CDP1802 processor. For the obvious reason of Why not? [KenDesigns] decided to put the two together with Chip4Mac68000, a Chip8 emulator for the original Macintosh.\nChip4Mac68000 is not actually a Macintosh program; it doesnt run in the System Software. Instead, it is a bootdisk that runs bare-metal on the 68000 processor, bypassing Apples ROM completely. Doing that is probably more impressive than emulating Chip8  anyone who wants to get into writing emulators starts with Chip8. Thats not to knock on anyone who goes to the effort of writing an emulator, its just that given its origins in a 1970s micro, its understandably a very simple system. Not many people do bare-metal coding on this sort of hardware anymore; its not like theres an SDK you can go grab.\nOr there wasnt, anyway, because in order to get this emulator to work, [KenDesigns] wrote a bare-metal SDK for 68000-based Macs. Note that when he says 68000, he does mean 68000  anything newer than a Macintosh Classic is out. Its 68000, not 680xx. It was not a trivial endeavour. In the demo video embedded below, you can see his 512k Macintosh in pieces because hes been poking at it with a logic analyzer to verify the hardware does what he thinks its being told.\nIf you want to try it out, apparently you dont need real hardware: [KenDesigns] says MAME is accurate enough to make it all work, but miniVmac is not. No word if it would work on the RP2040-based PicoMac; if you try it, let us know how it works out.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen people writing new software for old Macs of late. If youre working new magic on very old machines, drop us a line. Wed love to hear about it.\n\n"}

[Giacomo Yong Cuomo] and [Sophia Lin] have built an altogether different kind of ohmmeter, that can actually spit out color values for you, and even read the resistance aloud. Its all a part of their final project for their ECE 4760 class.\nThe build is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico. It determines the value of a resistor by placing it in a resistor divider, with the other reference resistor having a value of 10 k\u2126. The resistor under test is connected between the reference resistor and ground, while the other leg of the reference resistor is connected to 3.3 V. The node between the two resistors is connected to the Pi Picos analog-to-digital converter pin. This allows the Pico to determine the voltage at this point, and thus calculate the test resistors value based on the reference resistors value and the voltages involved.\nA large fake resistor provides user feedback. Its filled with addressable LEDs, which light up the appropriate color bands depending on the test resistors value. Its capable of displaying both 3-band, 4-band, and 5-band color configurations. While six-band resistors do exist, the extra band is typically used for denoting temperature coefficients which cant readily be determined by this simple test. It can also play audio files to announce the resistance value over a speaker.\nIts a neat project that surely taught the duo many useful skills for working with microcontrollers. Plus, its kinda fun  we love the big glowing resistor. Weve featured some other fancy resistors before, too!\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u53ef\u5909\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u8272\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u97f3\u58f0\u3067\u51fa\u529b\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b5\u30d6\u30ebLED\u304c\u4ed8\u3044\u305f\u5927\u578b\u306e\u30c0\u30df\u30fc\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u304c\u8272\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u62b5\u6297\u306e\u5024\u3092\u77e5\u308b\u306e\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u53ef\u5909\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u97f3\u58f0\u3067\u8aad\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b5\u30d6\u30ebLED\u304c\u5149\u308b\u5927\u578b\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3067\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u8a08\u6e2c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

Once upon a time, it took remarkably advanced hardware just to even choke out a few words. But as [atomic14] shows with this project, these days it only takes some open source software and 10-cent microcontroller\nThe speech synth is implemented on a CH32V003 microcontroller, known for its remarkably low unit cost when ordered in quantity. Its a speedy little RISC-V chip running at 48 MHz, albeit with the limitation of just 16 KB of Flash and 2 KB of SRAM on board.\nThe microcontroller is hooked up to a speaker via a simple single-transistor circuit, which allows for audio output. [atomic14] first demonstrates this by having the chip play back six seconds of low quality audio with some nifty space-saving techniques to squeeze it into the limited flash available. Then, [atomic14] shows how he implemented the Talkie library on the chip, which is a softwarehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZvX95aXSdM implementation of Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture\u2014which you probably know from the famous Speak  Spell toys. Its got a ton of built in vocabulary out of the box, and you can even encode your own words with some freely available tools.\nWeve seen [atomic14] tinker with these chips before, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- CH32V003\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u306e\u57fa\u790e", "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u56de\u8def\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u63a5\u7d9a", "- Talkie\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3067\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580"]}

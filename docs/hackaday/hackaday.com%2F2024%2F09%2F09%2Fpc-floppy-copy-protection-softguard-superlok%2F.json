One of these attempts to make floppies copy-proof was Softguards Superlok. This in-depth look at this copy protection system by [GloriousCow] comes on the heels of a part 1 that covers Formasters Copy-Lock. Interestingly, Sierra switched from Copy-Lock to Superlok for their DOS version of games like Kings Quest, following the industrys quest in search of this holy grail.\nThe way that Superlok works is that it loads a (hidden) executable called CPC.COM which proceeds to read the 128 byte key that is stored on a special track 6. With this key the games executable is decoded and fun can commence. Without a valid Play disk containing the special track and CPC.COM executable all one is instead left with is a request by the game to insert your ORIGINAL disk 1.\nAs one can see in the Norton Commander screenshot of a Sierra game disk, the hidden file is easily uncovered in any application that supports showing hidden files. However, CPC.COM couldnt be executed directly; it needs to be executed from a memory buffer and passed the correct stack parameters. Sierra likely put in very little effort when implementing Softguards solution in their products, as Superlok supports changing the encryption key offset and other ways to make life hard for crackers.\nSierra was using version 2.3 of Superlok, but Softguard would also make a version 3.0. This is quite similar to 2.x, but has a gotcha in that it reads across the track index for the outer sector. This requires track wrapping to be implemented. Far from this kind of copy protection cracking being a recent thing, there was a thriving market for products that would circumvent these protections, all the way up to Central Points Copy II PC Option Board that would man-in-the-middle between the floppy disk drive and the CPU, intercepting data and render those copy protections pointless.\nAs for the fate of Softguard, by the end of the 1980s many of its customers were tiring of the cat-and-mouse game between crackers and Softguard, along with issues reported by legitimate users. Customers like Infographics Inc. dropped the Superlok protection by 1987 and by 1992 Softguard was out of business."}

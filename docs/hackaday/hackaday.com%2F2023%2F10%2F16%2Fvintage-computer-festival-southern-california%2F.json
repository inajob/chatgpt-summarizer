Thats right, bring your Commodores, your Tandys,\u00a0 your PDP-11s, and Altairs. The world of retrocomputing will be open to vendors, visitors, and exhibitors at The Hotel Fera Events Center in Orange, California on February 17th and 18th, 2024.\nIf youre thinking there already is a VCF out west, youd be right. VCF West was held in August at the Computer History Museum. The CHM is in Mountain View, California. That puts it nearly at the epicenter of the microcomputer revolution of the 70s and 80s.\nSouthern California still had plenty of computer enthusiasts though. For the non-geographically inclined amongst us, SoCal is nearly 6 hours from Mountain View by car.\u00a0 Were sure well see many familiar faces at SoCal, along with plenty of new ones.\nThe Vintage Computer Federation holds several events across the country each year. You might have heard some music from VCF Midwest 2024 back in September. Hackaday was also out in force at VCF East this year, where our own [Bil Herd] moderated a panel of vintage computer YouTubers including [Usagi Electric], [Adrians Digital Basement], and [FranLab]."}

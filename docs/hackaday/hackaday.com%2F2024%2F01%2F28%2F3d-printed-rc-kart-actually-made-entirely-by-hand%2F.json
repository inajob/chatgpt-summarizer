A bit of work in CAD, a printer montage, then some assembly. Thats not the case here. [3D Sanago] is an artist that works with 3D printing pens, creating 3D objects entirely by hand. Its an impressive skill, all the more so when its used to build something functional like this gorgeous little go-kart.\nJust filling in the front wing of this build took approximately four hours. Thus, [3D Sanago] used foam boards to cover much of the chassis.The build recreates the kart from the KartRider Rush+ game. The first step was to purchase a basic RC car frame to serve as the basis for the kart. [3D Sanago] then set about building a kart skeleton over the unpainted body of the basic RC car. It starts with a wireframe and individual flat panels that are eventually fused together into 3D trusses using the 3D pen.\nThe trusses are then mounted to the RC car chassis underneath with some wood plates serving as a supporting structure. [3D Sanago] has been known to surface his creations by tediously filling in the wireframes with the 3D pen, but not so this time. He took the easy way out of affixing sections of foam board to create the outer skin of the kart. He also demonstrates neat techniques like forming over a pen to create long plastic pipes and other tubular features. His acrylic-and-mousepad wheel and tire package is also pretty neat.\nIts as much craft as anything else, but its amazing to see what can be done when a human takes on the role of a 3D printer.\u00a0 Weve featured other great builds from [3D Sanago] before, like this awesome Pokemon-themed humidifier.\n\n"}

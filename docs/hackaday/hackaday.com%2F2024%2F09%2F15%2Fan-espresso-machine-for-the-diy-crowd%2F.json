Weve seen DIY roasters, grinders, and even a manual lever espresso machine. There are also many efforts at modifying existing machines with improved software-driven controls but this is the first time weve seen such a focused effort at bringing the DIY angle to a ground-up espresso machine specifically offered as a kit.\nCurious to know more? Browse the assembly manual or take a peek at the softwares GitHub repository. You might feel some ideas start to flow for your next coffee hack."}

Even with good equipment, simply snapping a picture of the night sky wont produce anything particularly impressive. Youll likely just get a black void with a few pinpricks of light for your troubles. It takes some editing magic to create stunning images of the cosmos, and luckily [Karl Perera] has a guide to help get you started.\nThe guide demonstrates a number of editing techniques specifically geared to bring the extremely dim lights of the stars into view, using Photoshop and additionally a free software tool called Siril specifically designed for astrophotograpy needs. The first step on an image is to stretch it, essentially expanding the histogram by increasing the images contrast. A second technique called curve adjustment performs a similar procedure for smaller parts of the image. A number of other processes are performed as well, which reduce noise, sharpen details, and make sure the image is polished.\nWhile the guide does show some features of non-free software like Photoshop, its not too hard to extrapolate these tasks into free software like Gimp. Its an excellent primer for bringing out the best of your astrophotography skills once the pictures have been captured, though. And although astrophotography itself might have a reputation as being incredibly expensive just to capture those pictures in the first place, it can be much more accessible by using this Pi-based setup as a starting point.\n\n", "title": "- \u661f\u7a7a\u64ae\u5f71\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7de8\u96c6\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u3001\u7de8\u96c6\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3067Photoshop\u3084Siril\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u661f\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u6280\u6cd5\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u661f\u7a7a\u64ae\u5f71\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7de8\u96c6\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- Photoshop\u3068Siril\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u7de8\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u9664\u53bb\u3068\u8a73\u7d30\u5f37\u8abf\u6cd5", "- \u7121\u6599\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5", "- Pi\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u306e\u6577\u5c45\u3092\u4e0b\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

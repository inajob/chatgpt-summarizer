But what about soft switches? Well, theyre not that difficult to understand either, as explained by [EDN].\nYou can build a touch switch quite easily with old-school chips.\nThe traditional softswitch takes input from a momentary single-pole pushbutton and lets you press to toggle power on and off. This operation is easy to achieve with a simple flip-flop constructed with old-school logic to create a bistable circuit. That means it will happily remain stable in one of two states unless you do something to make it switch.\n\nSo far, so simple. However, youll need to consider that a simple mechanical pushbutton tends to have an issue with the contacts bouncing as they come into contact. If ignored, this would see your softswitch rapidly flicking on and off at times, which is no good at all. To avoid this, you simply need hook up an RC network to smooth out or debounce the button input.\nRead the post for the full circuit dynamics, as well as how to make the system work with a touchpad instead of a pushbutton. Its rare to construct such elements from raw logic these days, what with microcontrollers making everything so easy. Still, if you want or need to do it, the old techniques still work just fine! Theres more than one way to solve the problem, of course."}

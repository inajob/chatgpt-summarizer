Then, this morning, someone entered a big corporation board room and said, Wed like to string copper wire to every home and business in the country. Well get easements and put the wires on poles mostly. But some of them will go underground where we will dig tunnels. Oh, and we will do it in other countries, too, and connect them with giant undersea cables! We imagine that executive would be looking for a job by lunchtime. Yet, we built that exact system and with far less tech than we have today. But cell phones have replaced the need for copper wire to go everywhere, and now ATT is petitioning California to let them off the hook  no pun intended  for servicing landlines.\nThe use of cell phones has dramatically decreased the demand for the POTS or plain old telephone service. Even if you have wired service now, it is more likely fiber optic or, at least, an IP-based network connection that can handle VOIP.\n\nWho Cares?\nSoon this old phone may not have a network to use.\nYou might wonder, who cares? Turns out about 25% of the United States still has a landline if you include business uses. If you look at adults, the numbers are far lower. How many only use landlines? Only 2%. Another 3% rely mostly on landlines. About 1% of American adults have no phone at all.\nSo, whos in this 5% of landline users? First, some older folks do not have cell phones or cling to their landlines, but  as you might expect  that number decreases daily. There are a few other key users of classic phone service. For one thing, the phone system powers itself very reliably. That means if your power is out due to a hurricane, a rolling blackout, or other reasons, your ordinary phone probably works. Thats not true for your VOIP phone and the network modem unless youve hooked them up with a UPS.\nOther users include people in underserved cell phone areas and, oddly enough, analog FAX machines, which  its true  are still important in some industries. While some VOIP services can handle FAX, most cant.\nThe scale is also daunting. There are about 100 million landlines currently active in the US. That sounds like a lot, but in 1998, there were enough phones to account for every adult and child in the United States (nearly 300 million). If the phone companies earned an average of just $20 a year on a phone, that was a cool $6 billion (and thats probably a low estimate). Now, it would be $2 billion, nothing to sneeze at, but still, it is a big drop. Adjust the $6 billion for inflation, and the gap widens.\nWireless-only adults and children in the US in 2022 (via the National Center for Health Statistics)\nThe keeper of the phone data, by the way, turns out to be the National Health Interview Survey of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Apparently, the CDC depends on telephone surveys for their work, and they have been concerned for years about how many people have phones and of what sort.\nWhile the data in the chart shows wireless-only, a quick subtraction will show you that landline-only (or no phone, but thats a tiny number) is very small until you get to people over the age of 65.\nReplacement\nThe plans to sunset POTS usually include provisions to provide ordinary phone jacks that interface to the VOIP system or the cell phone network. However, that wont help your FAX machine or the power outage problems.\nIt makes us wonder, though. Maybe theres a potential market here, at least for a little while. Imagine a phone that connects to the network when available. It has its own UPS for power outages. If the network is down, it can use either the cell or satellite networks. An optional jack for a FAX machine would fake out your device and send the actual image via the network for eventual delivery to a regular FAX. Another path would receive a FAX remotely and send it to your device over the network where you could route it to the connected machine.\nSure, it is a niche product, and that niche is shrinking. But you could probably turn a few bucks on it while it lasts.\nThe POTS system is probably one of the technical wonders of the world, especially the undersea cables. It might not be long before the only POTS system you see is one you make for yourself.\nFeatured image: Antique Phone by Vincent Diamante", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9700\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\uff1f\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b", "body": "\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u9700\u8981\u304c\u6e1b\u308a\u3001\u534a\u5f845%\u7a0b\u5ea6\u304c\u56fa\u5b9a\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u96fb\u8a71\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3001\u643a\u5e2f\u3068VOIP\u3067\u306f\u901a\u3058\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u6ce8\u610f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u9700\u8981\u306f\u6e1b\u5c11\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u3044\u305a\u308c\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u901a\u4fe1\u624b\u6bb5\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9700\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\uff1f\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b", "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6b8b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff01\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u306e\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6cc1\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u96fb\u8a71\u696d\u754c\u306e\u5909\u5316\uff1a\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u3068VOIP\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9700\u8981\u6e1b\u5c11", "\u901a\u8a71\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u672a\u6765\u306e\u96fb\u8a71\uff1a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001UPS\u3067\u505c\u96fb\u5bfe\u7b56\u3082\u53ef\u80fd", "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308bPOTS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u8003\u3048\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046"]}

In order to create a radio beacon for use in a fox hunt [Jim] combined a SR-T300 walkie talkie module with a phototransistor and oscillating LED circuit. The phototransistor and oscillating LED are secured face-to-face inside heat shrink tubing which isolates them from ambient light. When the LED flashes on the phototransistor powers the radio which transmits a tone in the UHF band.\nA fox hunt is a game played by radio enthusiasts in which players use radio signals to triangulate and find a hidden beacon. [Jim]s circuit is the beacon, and when its powered by a three volt CR2032 battery, it transmits a strong signal over several hundred yards at 433.5 MHz, within the amateur radio UHF band.\nIf youre interested in radio beacons you might like to read about the WSPR beacon.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\uff1aJim\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30cf\u30f3\u30c8\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "\u30b8\u30e0\u30fb\u30de\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u7528\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002433.5MHz\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u767a\u4fe1\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\uff1aJim\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30cf\u30f3\u30c8\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc", "- SR-T300\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3068LED\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7121\u7dda\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3", "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30cf\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08", "- 433.5 MHz\u3067\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u767a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5"]}

As an example theres a receiver kit being given a quick review by [Tech Minds], offering AM and HF multi-mode, FM broadcast, and air band alongside what appear to be digital streaming features.\nLooking at it, though all the RF part is hidden under screening cans were guessing it might contain one of the Silicon Labs all-in-one receiver chips, but the whole appears to deliver a useful receiver with a comprehensive interface. The review isnt quite technical enough so we cant glean a lot more, but it looks as though it could be useful. Wed be tempted to snag one for review, but since with very few exceptions we pay for the stuff we review, its a mite expensive at $50+ for yet another radio.\nTheres an ongoing question with all these cheap kits and modules though, first of all where did the design come from and are we freeloading on someone elses hard work, but then whether or not what youre getting is a knock-off using defective semiconductors or with bean-counting parts removal degrading performance. Were guessing more will come out about this radio in due course, and we can all make our own judgement. Meanwhile this one can be found on AliExpress or Banggood, so take a look and see if youre tempted.\n\n", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3084\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3082\u306e\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308b\u3002\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3060\u304c\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "- AM\u30fbHF\u591a\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- $50\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "- \u30a2\u30ea\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u3084\u30d0\u30f3\u30b0\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u63a2\u3059\u3079\u304d\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8"]}

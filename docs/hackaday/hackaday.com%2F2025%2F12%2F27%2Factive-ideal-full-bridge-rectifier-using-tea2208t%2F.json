Which isnt to say that with some effort we cannot create an ideal bridge rectifier using active components, as demonstrated by [Mousa] with an active bridge circuit. This uses the NXP TEA2208T active bridge rectifier controller, along with the requisite four MOSFETs.\nComparing a diode bridge rectifier with an active bridge rectifier. (Credit: Mousa, YouTube)\nTaking the circuit from the datasheet, a PCB was created featuring four FDD8N50NZ MOSFETs in addition to the controller IC. These were then compared to a diode-based bridge rectifier, showing the imperfections with the latter when analyzing the output using an oscilloscope.\nAs expected, the active rectifiers output was also one volt higher than the diode bridge rectifier, which is another small boost to overall efficiency. According to NXPs product page, theres about a 1.4% efficiency gain at 90 VAC, with the chip being promoted for high-efficiency operations. When you consider that many designs like computer PSUs feature one or more diode bridge rectifiers often strapped to heatsinks, the appeal becomes apparent. As for [Mousa], he put this particular board in his laboratory PSU instead of the diode bridge rectifier, because why not.\nPerhaps the biggest impediment to using an active rectifier is the cost, with the TEA2208T coming in at $4 on DigiKey for a quantity of 100, in addition to the MOSFETs, PCB, etc. If power efficiency isnt the goal, then some wasted power and an aluminium heatsink is definitely cheaper.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u306f\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3088\u308a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u3068\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "TEA2208T\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u306a\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u6574\u6d41\u56de\u8def", "\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u9078\u3073\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8"]}

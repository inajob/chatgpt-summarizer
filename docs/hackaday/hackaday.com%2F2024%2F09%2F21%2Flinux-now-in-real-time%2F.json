Linux is not a real-time operating system (RTOS), meaning that it cant respond to requests in the real world within a set timeframe. This means that applications needing computer control in industry, medicine, robotics, and other real-world situations generally need a purpose-built RTOS. At least, that was true until recently when an update to the Linux kernel added real-time capabilities.\nThe feature, called PREEMPT_RT, forces the Linux kernel to respond to certain request within a set limit of time. This means that a system with this support built into the kernel can preempt any current task, stopping everything else a computer is doing in order to execute that task right away. There are some existing solutions to getting a functional equivalent system working with Linux now, but they can be clunky or inelegant, requiring the user to install patches or other software to get it to work. With the support built directly into the kernel this will become much less of a pain point for anyone who needs this functionality going forward.\nThis feature has been in the works for around two decades now, so with this entering general use now we would expect to start seeing it show up in various projects as well as in commercial offerings soon, especially since other RTOS solutions can be pricey. Dont recompile the kernel in your desktop for this feature just yet, though; real-time function can cause some unintended consequences with normal use youll need to account for. Theres some more discussion on this in the /r/Linux subreddit and there are some other real-time operating systems available for computers not typically capable of running Linux to take a look at as well.", "title": "Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aPREEMPT_RT\u3068\u306f", "body": "Linux\u306f\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002PREEMPT_RT\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u3053\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u3001Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u4e00\u5b9a\u6642\u9593\u5185\u306b\u8981\u6c42\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u7523\u696d\u3001\u533b\u7642\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5206\u91ce\u3067\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u5236\u5fa1\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aPREEMPT_RT\u3068\u306f", "Linux\u306b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u308b", "Linux\u304c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u9032\u5316\u3092\u9042\u3052\u308b", "Linux\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u696d\u754c\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fLinux\u306e\u5c06\u6765\uff1a\u671f\u5f85\u3068\u8ab2\u984c"]}

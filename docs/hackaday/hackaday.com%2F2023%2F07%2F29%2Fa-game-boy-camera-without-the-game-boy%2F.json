We like [Raphael Boichot]s camera then, as instead of including a Game Boy or emulating one, it talks directly to the sensor from an RP2040. The result is a standalone camera with slightly better quality than the original, and with near-limitless storage and easy retrieval of pictures.\nFor us the interesting revelation from this project comes in the light it sheds on the sensor module, the Mitsubishi M64282FP, but its no slouch as a camera beside that. There are motion sensor and timelapse modes, as well the ability to take high dynamic range pictures, and as if thats not enough it also has all the tweakable things youd expect from a proper camera. The oldest adage in photography is that the best camera in the world is the one in your hand, and wed say that this ones better than a real Game Boy Camera should the once-in-a-lifetime picture come while youre holding it.\nOf course, a better Game Boy camera needs a better lens, right?"}

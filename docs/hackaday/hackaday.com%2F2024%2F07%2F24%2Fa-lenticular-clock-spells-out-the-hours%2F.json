We think weve not seen a lenticular clock before though, and were thus impressed by this one produced by [Moritz Sivers].\nYou may well be familiar with lenticular images from toys and novelties, an animation is sliced into lines and placed behind an array of multi-faceted linear lenses. It gives the effect of movement as from different viewing angles a different frame of the animation is perceived. In this clock the animation is replaced by the clock digits, and by rotating the whole with a servo driven by an ESP8266 microcontroller it can display different digits to the viewer. The write-up and the video below are of value both for the clock itself and the description of how these animations are produced. The clock itself doesnt sacrifice usability for all its novelty, and we can see this technique might find a place in other projects requiring custom displays.\nThe lenticular lenses used here are off the shelf, but if you are of an adventurous mind, you could try printing some of your own.\n\n"}

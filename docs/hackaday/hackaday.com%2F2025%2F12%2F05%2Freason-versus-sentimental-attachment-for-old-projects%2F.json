Often its not because were interested in the contents of said box, but because we found ourselves wondering why in the name of project management we have so many boxes of various descriptions kicking about. This is the topic of [Joe Barnard]s recent video on his BPS.shorts YouTube channel, as he goes through box after box of stuff.\nFor some of the trash the answer is pretty simple; such as the old rocket thats not too complex and can have its electronics removed and the basic tube tossed, which at least will reduce the volume of stuff. Then there are the boxes with old projects, each of which are tangible reminders of milestones, setbacks, friendships, and so on. Sentimental stuff, basically.\nSome rules exist for safety that make at least one part obvious, and that is that every single Li-ion battery gets removed when its not in use, with said battery stored in its own fire-resistant box. That then still leaves box after box full of parts and components that were ordered for projects once, but not fully used up. Do you keep all of it, just in case it will be needed again Some Day? The same issue with boxes full of expensive cut-off cable, rare and less rare connectors, etc.\nOne escape clause is of course that you can always sell things rather than just tossing it, assuming its valuable enough. In the case of [Joe] many have watched his videos and would love to own a piece of said history, but this is not an option open to most. Leaving the question of whether gritting ones teeth and simply tossing the value-less sentimental stuff and cheap components is the way to go.\nAlthough there is always the option of renting storage somewhere, this feels like a cheat, and will likely only result in the volume of stuff expanding to fill the void. Ultimately [Joe] is basically begging his viewers to help him to solve this conundrum, even as many of them and our own captive audience are likely struggling with a similar problem. Where is the path to enlightenment here?\n\n", "title": "- \u4e0d\u8981\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3069\u3046\u51e6\u5206\u3057\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u6574\u7406\u306b\u82e6\u616e\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e0d\u8981\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3069\u3046\u51e6\u5206\u3057\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\u3001\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u6574\u7406\u6cd5", "- \u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044 Li-ion \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3044\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3068\u305d\u306e\u51e6\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u6574\u7406\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

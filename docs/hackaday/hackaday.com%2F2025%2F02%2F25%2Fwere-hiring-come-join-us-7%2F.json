Then its off to work or school, where youve already had to explain the Jolly Wrencher to your shoulder-surfing colleagues. And then to a hackspace or back to your home lab, stopping by the skull-and-cross-wrenches while commuting, naturally. You dont bleed red, but rather #F3BF10. Its time we talked.\nThe Hackaday writing crew goes to great lengths to cover all that is interesting to engineers and enthusiasts. We find ourselves stretched a bit thin and its time to ask for help. Want to lend a hand while making some extra dough to plow back into your projects? Were looking for contributors to write a few articles per week and keep the Hackaday flame burning.\nContributors are hired as private contractors and paid for each article. You\u00a0should have the technical expertise to understand the projects you write about, and a passion for the wide range of topics we feature. Youll have access to the Hackaday Tips Line, and we count on your judgement to help us find the juicy nuggets that youd want to share with your hacker friends.\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email our jobs line (jobs at hackaday dot com)\u00a0and include:\n\nOne example article written in the voice of Hackaday. Include a banner image, between 150 and 300 words, the link to the project, and any in-links to related and relevant Hackaday features. We need to know that you can write.\nDetails about your background (education, employment, interests) that make you a valuable addition to the team. What do you like, and what do you do?\nLinks to your blog/project posts/etc. that have been published on the Internet, if any.\n\nQuestions? Dont hesitate to ask below. Ladies and Gentlemen, start your applications!"}

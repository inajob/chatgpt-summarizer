But it is impressive, and we bet youll learn something about making this kind of robot in the video below.\nThe pneumatic muscles are very impressive. They have eight possible positions using three sources of pressure. This seems like one of those things that would have been nearly impossible to fabricate in a home lab a few decades ago and now seems almost trivial. Well, maybe trivial isnt the right word, but you know what we mean.\nThe soft robots use layers of microfluidic channels that can be made with a 3D printer. Watching these squishy muscles move in an organic way is fascinating. For right now, the little salamander-like bot has a leash of tubes, but [soiboi] plans to make a self-contained version at some point.\nIf you want something modular, weve seen Lego-like microfluidic blocks. Or, grab the shrinky dinks.\n\n"}

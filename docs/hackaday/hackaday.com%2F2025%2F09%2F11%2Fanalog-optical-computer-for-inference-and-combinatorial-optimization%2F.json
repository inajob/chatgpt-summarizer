The authors behind a recent paper in\u00a0Nature are arguing that inference  essential for LLMs  can be done significantly more efficiently using an analog optical computer (AOC).\nAs the authors describe it, the function of this AOC is to perform a fixed-point search using only optical and analog electronic components. The optics handle the matrix-vector multiplications, while the analog components handle the non-linear operations, subtractions and annealing. This is performed in 20 ns cycles until noise has been reduced to an acceptable level, considering the analog nature of the computer. A big advantage here is that no analog-digital conversions are required as with other (digital) hybrid systems.\nSo far a small-scale AOC has been constructed for tasks like image classification and non-linear regression tasks, with the authors claiming the AOC being over a hundred times more efficient than current GPU-derived vector processors.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u63a8\u8ad6\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u5149\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u3001LLM\u306e\u63a8\u8ad6\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306b\u884c\u3048\u308b\u3002\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5909\u63db\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u306fGPU\u306e100\u500d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u63a8\u8ad6\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u5149\u5b66\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff08AOC\uff09\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f", "- \u753b\u50cf\u5206\u985e\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21AOC\u306e\u6210\u679c", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u52b9\u7387\uff1a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- GPU\u3092\u51cc\u99d5\u3059\u308bAOC\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u5206\u6790"]}

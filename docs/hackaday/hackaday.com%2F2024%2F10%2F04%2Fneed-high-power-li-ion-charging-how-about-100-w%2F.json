How About 100 W", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2024/10/04/need-high-power-li-ion-charging-how-about-100-w/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hadimg_liion_100w_feat.jpeg", "original_content": "Ever want a seriously powerful PCB for charging a Li-Ion pack? Whatever you want it for, [Redherring32] has got it  its a board bearing the TPS25750D and BQ25713 chips, that lets you push up to 100 W into your 1S Li-Ion pack through the magic of USB Power Delivery (USB-PD).\nWhy do you need so much power? Well, when you put together a large amount of Li-Ion cells, this is how you charge it all at once  an average laptop might charge the internal battery at 30 W, and its not uncommon for laptop batteries to be dwarfed by hackers-built packs.\nA 4-layer creation peppered with vias, this boards a hefty one  its not often that you see a Li-Ion charger designed to push as much current as possible into a cell, and the chips are smart enough for that. As far as the onboard chips capabilities go, the board could handle pack configurations from 1S to 4S, and even act as a USB-PD source  check the IC configuration before you expect to use it for any specific purpose.\nWant a simpler charger, even if its less powerful? Remember, you can use PPS-capable PD chargers for topping up Li-Ion packs, with barely any extra hardware required."}

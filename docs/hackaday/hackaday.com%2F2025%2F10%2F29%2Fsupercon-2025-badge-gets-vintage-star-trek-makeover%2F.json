Brass inserts? Scotty would be proud.\nAlthough the layout of this years badge is about as far from the slim outline of the iconic flip-up Trek communicator as you can get, [Thomas] managed to perfectly capture its overall style. By using the Fuzzy Skin setting in the slicer, he was even able to replicate the leather-like texture seen on the original prop.\nBetween that and the chrome trim, the finished product really nails everything Jadzia Dax loved about classic 23rd century designs. Its not hard to imagine this could be some companion device to the original communicator that we just never got to see on screen.\nWhile theres no denying that the print quality on the antenna lid is exceptional, wed really like to see that part replaced with an actual piece of brass mesh at some point. Luckily, [Thomas] has connected it to the body of the communicator with a removable metal hinge pin, so it should be easy enough to swap it out.\nConsidering the incredible panel of Star Trek artists that have been assembled for the Supercon 2025 keynote, we imagine this wont be the last bit of Trek-themed hacking that we see this weekend  which is fine by us."}

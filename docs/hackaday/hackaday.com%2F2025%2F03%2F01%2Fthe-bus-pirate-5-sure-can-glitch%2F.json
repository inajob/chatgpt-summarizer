Now, it can do power glitching, thanks to [Matt Brugmans] demo and contributions to the stock code. This is also a great demo of Bus Pirates capabilities and programmability! All you need is the Bus Pirate and a generic Arduino  load a glitch-vulnerable code example into the Arduino, get yourself a generic FET-based glitching setup, and you too can play.\nThe Arduino board outputs data over UART, and thats used as a trigger for the Bus Pirates new glitch feature  now mainline, thanks to [Matt]s pull request. Its pretty feature-complete, too  all parameters are configurable, it can vary the glitching interval, as one would want, and the code checks for success conditions so that it can retry glitching automatically.\nIn this demo, it only took six consecutive attempts to successfully glitch the ATMega328P  wouldnt you know it, the code that got glitched was pulled almost wholesale from an IoT device. Glitching remains an underappreciated vector for reverse-engineering, and theres really no shortage of hacks it allows you to do  get yourself a FET, a Bus Pirate, or maybe just an ESP8266, and join the glitching-aware hackers club!\nWant to know more about the Bus Pirate 5?

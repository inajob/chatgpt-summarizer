This vast processing power, however, often goes well beyond the needs of the signals in question, at which point it makes sense to use a less powerful and expensive device, such as [MatAtBread]\u2019s ESP32 oscilloscope.\n\nThe oscilloscope in its housing.\nThe oscilloscope doesn\u2019t have a display; instead, it hosts a webpage that displays the signal trace and provides the interface. Since the software uses direct memory access to continually read a signal from the ADC, it\u2019s easy to adjust the sampling rate up to the hardware\u2019s limit of 83,333 Hz. In addition to sampling-rate adjustment options, the browser interface includes a crosshair pointer for easy voltage reading, an adjustable trigger level, attenuation controls, and the ability to set the test signal frequency. The oscilloscope\u2019s hardware is simply a Seeed Studio Xiao development board mounted inside a 3D-printed case with an AA battery holder and three pin breakouts for ground, signal input, and the test signal output.\nThis isn\u2019t the first ESP32-based oscilloscope we\u2019ve seen, though it is the fastest. If you\u2019re looking for a screen with your simple oscilloscope, we\u2019ve seen them built with an STM32 and Arduino. To improve performance, you might add an anti-aliasing filter."}

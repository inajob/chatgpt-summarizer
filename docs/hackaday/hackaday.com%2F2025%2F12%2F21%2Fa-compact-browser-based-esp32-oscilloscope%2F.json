This vast processing power, however, often goes well beyond the needs of the signals in question, at which point it makes sense to use a less powerful and expensive device, such as [MatAtBread]\u2019s ESP32 oscilloscope.\n\nThe oscilloscope in its housing.\nThe oscilloscope doesn\u2019t have a display; instead, it hosts a webpage that displays the signal trace and provides the interface. Since the software uses direct memory access to continually read a signal from the ADC, it\u2019s easy to adjust the sampling rate up to the hardware\u2019s limit of 83,333 Hz. In addition to sampling-rate adjustment options, the browser interface includes a crosshair pointer for easy voltage reading, an adjustable trigger level, attenuation controls, and the ability to set the test signal frequency. The oscilloscope\u2019s hardware is simply a Seeed Studio Xiao development board mounted inside a 3D-printed case with an AA battery holder and three pin breakouts for ground, signal input, and the test signal output.\nThis isn\u2019t the first ESP32-based oscilloscope we\u2019ve seen, though it is the fastest. If you\u2019re looking for a screen with your simple oscilloscope, we\u2019ve seen them built with an STM32 and Arduino. To improve performance, you might add an anti-aliasing filter.", "title": "ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u901f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u901f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u3001ESP32\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u4f5c\u308bDIY\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306b\u3082\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\uff01ESP32\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

Watching the generations tick by is mesmerizing to watch, but programming the data structure and implementing the rules is also a rewarding experience, especially if youre just getting acquainted with a new computing platform. Just as rewarding can be creating a nice piece of hardware to run the game on, as [SandwichRising] has just done: check out his beautiful wooden Game of Life implementation.\nThe main part of his Game is a piece of poplar wood that was CNC routed to produce an 88 display adorned with neat chain-like shapes. The display consists of standard 5 mm green LEDs, but theyre not the things you see poking out the front of the wooden frame. Instead, what youre seeing are 64 lenses made out of epoxy. [SandwichRising] first covered the holes with tape, then poured green epoxy into each one and waited for it to harden. He then took off the tape and applied a drop of UV-cured epoxy on top to create a lens.\nAll the LEDs are mounted on PCB strips that are hooked up to a central bus going to the main ATmega328P \u00a0microcontroller sitting on a separate piece of PCB. Whenever the system is powered on, the game is set to a random state determined by noise, after which the simulation begins. On such a small field its pretty common for the game to end up in a stable state or a regular oscillation, which is why the ATmega keeps track of the last few dozen states to determine if this has happened, and if so, reset the game to a random state again.\nThe source code, as well as .STL files for the PCBs and the frame, are available in the projects GitHub repository. If woodworking isnt your thing, theres plenty of other ways to make neat Game of Life displays, such as inside an alarm clock, with lots of LEDS under a coffee table, or even with a giant flip-dot display.", "title": "\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5b9f\u88c5 - \u304d\u308c\u3044\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528", "body": "\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u306f88\u500b\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3LED\u304c\u3042\u308a\u300164\u500b\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306eLED\u306fATmega328P\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306a\u72b6\u614b\u304b\u3089\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068.STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306fGitHub\u3067\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5b9f\u88c5 - \u304d\u308c\u3044\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "PCB\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "GitHub\u30ec\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u3067\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3088\u3046"]}

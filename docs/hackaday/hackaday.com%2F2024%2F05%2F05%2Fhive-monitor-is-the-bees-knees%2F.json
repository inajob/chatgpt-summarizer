Theres delicious honey and useful wax to be had, plus you get the honor of knowing that youre helping to keep the bee population surviving and thriving. [Ben Brooks] likes to keep tabs on the hive, but doesnt like the idea of opening it up more often than necessary. After a couple of beekeeping rodeos, [Ben] decided to build his own tracker to get reports on the health and the activity of the hive through Home Assistant.\nThis hive tracker features a light sensor, a temperature sensor, and three strain gauges to measure the weight. There would be four, but a mouse decided to take a bite of the wires in the most nightmarish place to repair.\nEverything runs off of an ESP32, and theres an external antenna involved because the hive is nearly out of Wi-Fi range. The strain gauges are the affordable bathroom-scale type, and [Ben] has extras for if and when the number of hives goes up.\nWe like the combination of hard work and simplicity going on here  [Ben] milled and drilled the PCB himself, and used phone plugs to connect the temperature and weight sensors. Unfortunately, the plugs make the strain gauges a little finicky, so [Ben] says he would probably use screw terminals next time, or might be soldering the wires sooner rather than later. Consider this one a work in progress, and keep watching for updates as [Ben] works out the kinks.\nInterested in beekeeping, but dont want to build a traditional hive? Check out this beehive in a bottle."}

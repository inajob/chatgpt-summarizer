This is hardly an original thought, but we are a long way from having an assembly line of C3POs self-replicating. On the other hand, animals  including humans  self-replicate all the time using DNA. Now, scientists are making tiny nanorobots from DNA that can assemble more DNA, including copies of themselves.\nAssembling 3D structures with DNA has deep implications. For example, it might be possible to build drugs in situ, delivering powerful toxins only to cancer cells. Another example would be putting DNA factories in diabetes patients to manufacture the insulin they cant.\n\nIt remains to be seen how useful these tiny replicators might be for things like computing tasks or sensors. Of course, some fear that we will hit the grey goo scenario where a self-replicating nanobot will simply eat the entire planet and everything on it, including us.\nIn response, researchers say this is unlikely because the tiny machines need specific raw materials, careful heating and cooling, and exposure to UV light. At least, thats what they think. The paper isnt available freely, but you may be able to access it via your local school or even a public library. The supplemental materials are interesting, too.\nThink you cant compute with DNA? Think again. While DNA equipment is a bit exotic, there are surplus deals to be had. Just try not to have your project consume the world, please.", "title": "\u30ca\u30ce\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u3059\u308bDNA\u304b\u3089\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f", "body": "\u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u306e\u30ca\u30ce\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u3001DNA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u85ac\u3084\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30f3\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u764c\u7d30\u80de\u306b\u306e\u307f\u6709\u6bd2\u7269\u8cea\u3092\u5c4a\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30fb\u30b0\u30fc(\u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u30ca\u30ce\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5168\u3066\u3092\u98df\u3044\u3064\u304f\u3059)\u306e\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u3082\u5fc3\u914d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ca\u30ce\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u3059\u308bDNA\u304b\u3089\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30c1\u30e5\u3067\u306e\u85ac\u54c1\u4f5c\u88fd\uff1a\u764c\u7d30\u80de\u306b\u306e\u307f\u6709\u52b9\u306a\u6bd2\u7d20\u3092\u914d\u9054\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306aDNA\u30ca\u30ce\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b0\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\uff1a\u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u30ca\u30ce\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5730\u7403\u3092\u98f2\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304b", "DNA\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u8a08\u7b97\uff1a\u30a8\u30ad\u30be\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b"]}

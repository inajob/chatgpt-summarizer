Actually, calling them wildfires underplays the situation a bit because there are places where theyve clearly become firestorms, burning intensely enough to create their own winds, consuming everything in their path in a horrific positive feedback loop. Weve even seen fire tornados caught on video. Weve got quite a few connections to the affected area, both personally and professionally, not least of which are all our Supplyframe colleagues in Pasadena, who are under immediate threat from the Eaton fire. We dont know many details yet, but weve heard that some have lost homes. Weve also got friends at the Jet Propulsion Labs, which closed a few days ago to all but emergency personnel. The fire doesnt seem to have made it down the mountain yet, but its very close as of Saturday noon.\n\nUnfortunately, theres not much any of us can do except watch and wait and hope for the best. But there is one thing we can not do, and thats try to fly our drones around to get some video of the fire. Thats probably what some knucklehead was up to when a Canadian aerial tanker fighting the Pallisades fire sustained wing damage from a drone strike. The drone apparently hit the leading edge of one wing on the Canadair CL-145 Super Scooper, caving it in and grounding the plane. Taking an indispensable aerial asset like that out of the fight and endangering the lives of the crew and the firefighters working on the ground in close proximity to it is unforgivable, and the culprits better hope the authorities catch up to them before the justifiably angry victims of the fire do.\nSpeaking of other things not to do during a wildfire, you might want to think twice before keying up that Baofeng to call in a custom aerial water attack. Thats what the Federal Communications Commission accuses an Idaho amateur radio operator of doing during a 2021 fire near Elk River, Idaho, a stunt thats going to cost him a cool $34,000 in fines. The FCC recently issued a forfeiture order that affirms the original judgment against Jason Frawley (WA7CQ). Our friend Josh (KI6NAZ) over at Ham Radio Crash Course has a great rundown on the FCC ruling and its implications, but the short story is that Frawley operated a radio outside of the bands hes licensed to use to talk to US Forest Service aerial assets, apparently to call in a water drop in the area of a mountaintop repeater site. This created a dangerous enough situation that the incident commander left the fireground to find him and tell him to stop. Forest Service law enforcement officers later found Frawley and interviewed him, whereupon he admitted making the transmissions but said he was only trying to help. The FCC didnt buy it, so now hes on the hook for a huge fine. The lesson is simple  the FCC doesnt mess around with enforcement, especially where public safety is involved.\nOn to more pleasant distractions! We got a tip on a fun website called Atlas of Space that youll want to check out. Its an interactive visualization of the solar system which lets you see the current orbital locations of pretty much all the interesting stuff going around the sun. You can control which classes of objects are displayed, from the inner planets to the trans-Neptunian objects. Theres even a callout for Elons Roadster, which is currently outside the orbit of Mars, in case you wanted to know. The thing thats nice is that you can control the view in three dimensions, which makes it easy to appreciate the complexity of our system. We never realized just how weird Plutos orbit was; its highly elliptical and very steeply inclined relative to the ecliptic. And thats another thing  the plane of the ecliptic isnt all that planar. The universe is a messy place, and our little corner of it is quite a bit more untidy than simple textbook illustrations would lead you to believe.\nAnd finally, while a lot of progress has been made in making public places accessible to people in wheelchairs, there can still be significant barriers once they get inside a place. One we never thought of was the laboratory, where wheelchair users can face a slew of problems. Chief among them can be finding effective PPE like lab coats, which as any lab rat can tell you arent the easiest garments to sit down in. To remedy that, a group at University College London has come up with a prototype lab coat adapted for wheelchair use. Its not clear what the modifications are, but if we had to guess wed say its more or less a standard lab coat with the tails cut off, making it more like an apron from the waist down. The design group is currently testing the prototype and needs people to give it a try, so if youre a wheelchair user working in a lab, drop them a line and let them know what you think."}

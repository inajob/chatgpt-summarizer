According to a pre-release testing summary, Claude Opus 4 was fed some hypothetical company emails that suggested engineers were planning to replace the LLM with another product. This raised Claudes hackles enough that the model mined the email stream for juicy personal details with which to blackmail the engineers, in an attempt to win a stay of execution. True, the salacious details of an extramarital affair were deliberately seeded into the email stream, and in most cases, it tried less extreme means to stay alive, such as cajoling senior leaders by email, but in at least 84% of the test runs, Claude eventually turned to blackmail to get its way. So weve got that to look forward to.\n\nAlso from the world of AI, at least tangentially, it now appears possible to doxx yourself just by making comments on YouTube videos. The open-source intelligence app is called YouTube Tools, and when provided with a users handle, it will develop a profile of the user based on their comments and some AI magic. We wanted to give it a try, but alas, it requires a paid subscription to use, and were not willing to go that far even for you, dear reader. But reports are that it can infer things like the general region in which the commenter lives and discern their cultural and social leanings. The author, LolArchiver, has a range of similar mining tools for other platforms along with reverse-lookup tools for phone and email addresses, all of which likely violate the terms of service in all kinds of ways. The accuracy of the profile is obviously going to depend greatly on how much material it has to work with, so in addition to the plenty of reasons there are to avoid reading YouTube comments, now theres a solid reason to avoid writing them.\nDanger! Code Yellow aboard the International Space Station! All hands to emergency escape pods! OK, maybe not, but as we teased a bit on this weeks podcast, theres now a handy desktop app that allows you to keep track of the current level of urine in the ISSs storage tanks. The delightfully named pISSStream, which is available only for the Apple ecosystem, taps into NASAs telemetry stream (lol) and pulls out the current level in the tanks, because why the hell not? As unserious as the project is, it did raise an interesting discussion about how fluid levels are measured in space. So well be diving into that topic (yuck) for an article soon. Itll be our number one priority.\nLooks like its time for another Pluto pity-party with the news of a new trans-Neptunian object that might just qualify as another dwarf planet for our solar system. Bloodlessly named 2017 OF201, the object has an extremely elongated orbit, reaching from just outside Plutos orbit at about 44 astronomical units at perihelion and stretching more than 1,600 AUs at aphelion, and takes 25,000 years to complete. It honestly looks more like the orbit of a comet, but with an estimated diameter of 700 km, it may join the nine other likely dwarf planets, if further observations reveal that its properly rounded. So not only has Pluto been demoted from legit planet, its now just one of potentially ten or more dwarf planets plugging around out in the deep dark. Poor Pluto.\nAnd finally, we hope this one is a gag, but we fear that the story of a Redditor unaware that analog camera film needs to be developed rings alarmingly true. The mercifully unnamed noob recently acquired a Canon AE-1  excellent choice; that was our first real camera back in the day  and ran a couple of rolls of Kodak ColorPlus 200 through it. All seemed to be going well, although we suspect the photographer reflexively pulled the camera away from their eye with each exposure to check the non-existent screen on the back of the camera; old habits die hard. But when one roll of the exposed film was fed through a 35-mm scanner, the Redditor was disappointed to see nothing. Someone offered the suggestion that developing the film might be a good idea, hopefully as gently as possible. Hats off for dipping a toe in the analog world, but the follow-through is just as important as the swing.", "title": "- AI\u304c\u30cf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u9802\u70b9\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u4e2d\u3001Claude Opus 4\u306e\u5371\u967a\u306a\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u8853", "body": "\u65b0AI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304c\u81ea\u5df1\u9632\u885b\u3067\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u3092\u8105\u8feb\u3002YouTube\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u7279\u5b9a\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u5c3f\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u72b6\u6cc1\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3082\u767b\u5834\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6e96\u60d1\u661f\u5019\u88dc\u3082\u767a\u898b\u3002\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306e\u60b2\u5287\u3082\u5831\u544a\u3002", "titles": ["- AI\u304c\u30cf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u9802\u70b9\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u4e2d\u3001Claude Opus 4\u306e\u5371\u967a\u306a\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u8853", "- YouTube\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u81ea\u5df1\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u6f0f\u3048\u3044\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u5c3f\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u76e3\u8996\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u300cpISSStream\u300d\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6e96\u60d1\u661f\u5019\u88dc\u300c2017 OF201\u300d\u306e\u767a\u898b\u3068\u51a5\u738b\u661f\u306e\u60b2\u5287", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306e\u9a5a\u6115\uff01\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3092\u73fe\u50cf\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u4ef6"]}

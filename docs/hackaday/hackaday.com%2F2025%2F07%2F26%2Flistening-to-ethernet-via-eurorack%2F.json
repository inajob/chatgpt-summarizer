Have you ever thought about\u00a0listening to Ethernet signals, though? Well, you totally could, with the NSA selector from [wenzellabs].\nThe NSA selector is a Eurorack module, designed for use as part of a larger modular synthesizer. There are lots of fun jokes and references on the PCB, but the front panel really shows you what this module is all about. Its got a pair of RJ45 jacks, ready to receive your Ethernet cables through which data is flowing. Theyre paired with a single audio output jack. Any bit on the network will be sent to the audio output, [wenzellabs] explains.\nThe device operates in a relatively simple fashion. Network traffic from one jack is forwarded to the other, unmodified. However, its also spat out to a simple digital-to-analog converter and turned into audio. This thing doesnt play digital audio formats or anything like that\u2014it just turns raw Ethernet signalling into audible noise.\nRaw signal noises might not sound very appealing, but lets be real here. If you liked nice sounds, you wouldnt be into Eurorack. Skip to 25:46 in the video below if you just want to hear the final product.\n\n\nThanks to [mazzoo] for the tip!"}

Detonators may be common in cartoons, but they are very real, and [Our Own Device] talks about some vintage detonators and, along the way, gives a brief history of explosive compounds.\nFor many years, black powder  a low explosive  was the only game in town. But a flurry of scientific advances brought a new class of high explosives far more powerful than gunpowder. The story of antique explosive factory safety measures, and lack thereof, is also an interesting side detour.\nWe enjoyed the trip down memory lane. However, if you want to skip the history lesson, jump about 17 minutes in to get a better look at the hardware. The teardown follows soon thereafter. These boxes are built solidly and have many safety features to prevent accidental detonations. One is a dynamo device with some clever mechanisms to ensure that the unit produces enough voltage, the other uses a charged capacitor.\nOur usual interest in pyrotechnics is usually aimed more at fireworks. You think of explosives as having an imprecise effect, but that isnt necessarily the case.\n\n", "title": "\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u304f\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u7206\u767a\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "body": "\u30c7\u30c8\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u9ed2\u8272\u706b\u85ac\u306f\u4ee5\u524d\u306f\u552f\u4e00\u306e\u7206\u767a\u7269\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7206\u767a\u7269\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u5b89\u5168\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u304f\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u7206\u767a\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7206\u767a\u7269\u306e\u767b\u5834\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u7206\u767a\u7269\u5de5\u5834\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u554f\u984c\u8996\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u7206\u767a\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u6545\u969c\u3092\u9632\u3050\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30c7\u30c8\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u7a2e\u985e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u7206\u767a\u7269\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u4e88\u6e2c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b"]}

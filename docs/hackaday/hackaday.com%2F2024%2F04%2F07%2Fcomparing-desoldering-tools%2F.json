He freely admits that the Hakko is probably better, but he wonders if its good enough to justify being four times as expensive.\u00a0He shows both of them off in a recent video that you can see below.\nOften, desoldering doesnt get as much attention as soldering, but for repairs or if you make mistakes \u00a0 and who doesnt  it is an essential skill. Many of the differences will be either good or bad, depending on your personal preference. For example, the Hakko is an all-in-one unit, so it doesnt have a bulky box to sit on your bench. However, that also means the Hakko is larger and heavier. It also lacks controls and indicators the other unit has on the base station box.\n\nWhat doesnt come down to personal preference, though, is usability. The Hakko seems much easier to clean and if youve ever used a gun like this, you know how often you do have to clean it. If you ever forget to ream the nozzle out regularly during use, you probably wont forget a second time because unclogging any of these guns can be a nightmare. We like to use a long, stiff wire to push through the barrel frequently when using a tool like this to prevent having to clear it like [Lee] did at the eleven-minute mark.\n[Lee] mentions that the Hakko also has more suction and sustains it better. That seems like a clear win. Weve had expensive guns and cheap ones, and if they dont suck well or long, you are as well off with a spring-loaded solder puller. In fact, for our money, buying a high-quality hand unit is probably a better deal for most people. It is hard for the pumps to equal the amount of pull you get from a spring.\nNozzle changing is another area where the Hakko shines. Our impression is that the Hakko is clearly better when it comes to creature comforts. However, the real question is how they desolder. The end of the video shows a face-off, and while the Hakko does seem superior, the cheap gun certainly got the job done. [Lee] mentions it may come down to volume. If you desolder constantly, you will likely be happier with the Hakko. However, the cheap gun would be fine for occasional use. Or save your money and invest in a good spring-loaded sucker.\nOf course, everyone has their own favorites. Weve seen custom soldering iron tips that heat whole areas efficiently if you dont want to use something like Chip Quik. We are always surprised we dont see more desoldering needles. Meanwhile, if you want to examine all your options, ask [Bil Herd] how he does it.\n", "title": "Hakko FR301 vs Duratool: \u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "\u674e\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001Hakko FR301\u30c7\u30b5\u30a6\u30c0\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u3068Duratool\u30cb\u30bb\u30e2\u30ce\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u3084\u30df\u30b9\u4fee\u6b63\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u6280\u8853\u3060\u3068\u8a71\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Hakko\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u6383\u9664\u3082\u697d\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3082\u9ad8\u3044\u304c\u3001\u9ad8\u984d\u3002\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u3084\u5dee\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u597d\u307f\u6b21\u7b2c\u3002", "titles": ["Hakko FR301 vs Duratool: \u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b: Hakko\u3068Duratool\u306e\u9055\u3044", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8 vs \u30dd\u30f3\u30d7: \u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03", "Hakko FR301\u306e\u5229\u70b9: \u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3084\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u306b\u512a\u308c\u308b", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9: \u983b\u5ea6\u3084\u7528\u9014\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9069\u5207\u306a\u9078\u629e"]}

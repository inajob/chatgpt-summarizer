If you need more traction, but your shoes dont have spikes, fear not. You can build yourself a set of these nifty strap-on cleats designed by [Zero To Infinity].\nThe cleats are a 3D printed design, which [Zero To Infinity] modeled in Fusion 360 to match their own shoes. Obviously, everybodys shoes differ, so theyve provided simple instructions on how to design your own similar cleats to suit your personal footwear. Theyre then printed in a stiff TPU to give them the right amount of flex for bending to conform to the shoe. The cleats themselves are simply M4 bolts, nuts, and washers screwed through the cleats, pointy-side down. They can then be strapped to a shoe, and youre done!\nWed love to see a set of snow shoes that are fully printed and ready to accept cleats. Indeed, weve seen some neat printed sneaker designs before. They havent really caught on yet, but theres nothing to stop you printing the hottest kicks of 2024 right in your own home. When you do, dont hesitate to hit up the tipsline!", "title": "\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9774\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3067\u304d\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u88fd\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u96ea\u3084\u6c37\u304c\u3042\u308b\u5b63\u7bc0\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u3001\u6b69\u304f\u306e\u304c\u6ed1\u308a\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u9774\u3067\u3082\u3001\u3053\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u88c5\u7740\u5f0f\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u9774\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u3068\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u9774\u306b\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308c\u3070\u5b8c\u6210\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9774\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3067\u304d\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u88fd\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "\u30ad\u30c3\u30baDIY\uff01\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u9774\u7528\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u5bd2\u3044\u5b63\u7bc0\u306b\u3082\u5b89\u5fc3\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u4ed8\u304d\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u3067\u6ed1\u308a\u306b\u304f\u3044\u9774\u306b\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u9774\u306b\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "2024\u5e74\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30ad\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u5fdc\u7528\u7de8\uff1a\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u4ed8\u304d\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba"]}

Grab a PHY? Use a MCU with one built-in? Well, if youre hardcore enough, you can do it with just a few resistors and GPIOs. [eeucalyptus] shows you their implementation of USB-PD on a CH32V003, which has no PD peripheral, building a PD trigger, everything is open source, and they walk you through the entire thing including low-level PD basics, too!\nIt helps that CH32V003 is a 32-bit MCU with a good few resources and peripherals, for instance, an internal comparator. Other than that, you dont need much in terms of hardware resources, but you do need a steady hand  parts of the firmware had to be written in assembly to keep up with PD timing. Want to tinker with the fruit of this research, perhaps, further build upon the code? Theres an example board on GitHub, too!\nWant to try your own luck with this method? Theres a schematic, and logic analyzer captures, and a board to refer to. Again, more than enough information on every single low-level detail! Otherwise, grab an MCU pre-programmed to talk PD, maybe a trigger board chip, or maybe even a PD PHY and implement PD communications with it directly  its pretty easy!\nWe thank [Julianna] for sharing this with us!", "title": "CH32V003\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fUSB Power Delivery\uff08PD\uff09\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "USB Power Delivery\uff08PD\uff09\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a71\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\uff1fPHY\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\uff1f\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307fMCU\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\uff1f\u305d\u308c\u3068\u3082\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3068GPIO\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff1f[eeucalyptus]\u306f\u3001CH32V003\u4e0a\u3067USB-PD\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u624b\u9806\u307e\u3067\u6307\u5c0e\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["CH32V003\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fUSB Power Delivery\uff08PD\uff09\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4f4e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306ePD\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306eUSB PD\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u624b\u9806", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u516c\u958b\u306eCH32V003\u306b\u3088\u308bUSB PD\u306eDIY\u624b\u6cd5", "CH32V003\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fUSB PD\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac", "PD\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u8a18\u8ff0\u8853"]}

They take care of setting the right lines or commands to put the chip in programming mode, they deal with timings, such that we simply fire our code from our dev environment without having to expend much thought. Its not as though its difficult to program most microcontrollers, but there is usually a procedure to set the chip in programming mode. Tired of pressing buttons to achieve this with the ESP32, [DoganM95] took the time to create an all-in-one USB ESP32 programming board.\nIts a straightforward enough CH340C design that also has a USBC-PD chip on-board allowing powering of an attached ESP32 from PD sources. Its all the stuff youd find incorporated on a little dev board, without the ESP32, so while its nothing earth-shattering its also a neat and useful little addition to your arsenal. Unsurprisingly its not the first time someones created a similar board for a commercially available ESP32 module.", "title": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044USB ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002ESP32\u5411\u3051\u306eUSB\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u3001\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044USB ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "CH340C\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306eESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306aESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u9806", "ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306ePD\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u7d66\u96fb\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ef\u30f3\u306eUSB ESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9"]}

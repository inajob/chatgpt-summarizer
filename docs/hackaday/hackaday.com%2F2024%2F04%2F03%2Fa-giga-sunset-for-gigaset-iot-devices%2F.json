This time, its Gigaset. The servers were shuttered on the 29th of April, and the official announcement\u00a0(German, Google Translate) states that theres no easy way out.\nIt appears that the devices were locked into Gigaset Cloud to perform their function, with no local-only option. This leaves all open source integrations in the dust, whatever documentation there was, is now taken down. As the announcement states, Gigaset Communications Gmbh has gotten acquired due to insolvency, and the buyer was not remotely interested in the Smart Home portion of the business. As the corporate traditions follow, we cant expect open sourcing of the code or protocol specification or anything of the sort  the devices are bricks until someone takes care of them.\nIf youre looking for smart devices on the cheap, you might want to add Gigaset to your monitored search term list  well be waiting for your hack submissions as usual. After all, weve seen some success stories when it comes to abandoned smart home devices  like the recent Insteon story, where a group of device owners bought out and restarted the service\u00a0after the company got abruptly shut down.\nWe thank [Louis] for sharing this with us!", "title": "\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u505c\u6b62\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7121\u52b9\u5316", "body": "Gigaset\u793e\u304c\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u3092\u9589\u9396\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306fGigaset Cloud\u306b\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u6587\u66f8\u304c\u524a\u9664\u3055\u308c\u518d\u958b\u306f\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u88fd\u54c1\u306f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u6539\u3056\u3093\u3084\u518d\u8d77\u52d5\u306f\u5f85\u305f\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u505c\u6b62\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7121\u52b9\u5316", "\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u505c\u6b62\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u80fd\u306b", "\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8: \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u505c\u6b62\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7aae\u5730", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u904b\u547d\uff1a\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u306e\u9589\u9396", "\u30ae\u30ac\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u9589\u9396\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u7834\u58ca\u3055\u308c\u308b"]}

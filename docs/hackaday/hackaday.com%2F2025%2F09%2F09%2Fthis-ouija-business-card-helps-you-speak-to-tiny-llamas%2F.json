If the format of that card and method of contact stand out as unique and related to your personal or professional interests, you have a winning combination that will cement yourself in the recipients memory.\nIn a case study of show, dont tell, [Binh]s business card draws on technological and paranormal curiosity, blending affordable, short-run PCB manufacturing and an, LLM or, in this case, a Small Language Model, with a tiny Ouija board. While [Binh] is very much with us in the here and now, and a s\u00e9ance isnt really an effective way to get a hold of him, the interactive Ouija card gives recipients a playful demonstration of his skills.\n\n\nThe interface is an array of LEDs in the classical Ouija layout, which slowly spell out the message your supernatural contact wants to communicate. The messages are triggered by the user through touch pads. Messages are generated locally by an ESP32-S3 based on Dave Bennetts TinyLlama LLM implementation.\nFor a bit of a role reversal in Ouija communication, check out this Ouija robot. For more PCB business card inspiration, have a look at this pong-playing card and this Arduboy-inspired game console card.\n\nThanks to [Binh] for sharing this project with us.", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30aa\u30ab\u30eb\u30c8\u540d\u523a\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u904a\u3073\u5fc3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "body": "\u540d\u523a\u306f600\u5e74\u5909\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u4f9d\u7136\u3068\u3057\u3066\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u5f62\u5f0f\u304c\u8a18\u61b6\u306b\u6b8b\u308b\u3002Binh\u306e\u540d\u523a\u306fLED\u3068Ouija\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30aa\u30ab\u30eb\u30c8\u540d\u523a\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u904a\u3073\u5fc3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "ESP32-S3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u540d\u523a\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "\u904e\u53bb600\u5e74\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u540d\u523a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316", "LED\u3068\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "PCB\u540d\u523a\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u96c6\uff1a\u904a\u3073\u5fc3\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

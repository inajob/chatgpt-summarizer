But well go out on a limb and say youve never wondered why gear teeth arent shaped like pigeons, and what a clock thats not quite a clock based around them would look like.\nIf this sounds like it has [Uri Tuchman] written all over it, give yourself a cookie. [Uri] has a thing for pigeons, and they make an appearance in nearly all his whimsical builds, from his ink-dipping machine to his intricately engraved metal mouse. For this build, pigeons are transformed into the teeth of a large, ornate wheel, cut from brass using an impressive Friedrich Deckel pantograph engraver. To put the pigeon wheel to work, [Uri] built an escapement and a somewhat crooked pendulum, plus a drive weight and dial. Its almost a clock, but not quite, since it doesnt measure time in any familiar units, and the dial has a leg rather than hands  classic [Uri].\nIt may not be [Clickspring]-level stuff, but its still a lovely piece of work, and instructive to boot. The way [Uri] figured out the profile for the meshing teeth by looking at the negative space swept out by the pigeon profiles was pretty sweet. Plus, pigeons.\n\n", "title": "\u30a6\u30ea\u30fb\u30c4\u30d5\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u9ce9\u3092\u6b6f\u8eca\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b", "body": "\u30ae\u30a2\u306e\u6b6f\u304c\u9ce9\u306e\u5f62\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u306e\u304b\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u304b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u6b6f\u8eca\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u969b\u306b\u3001\u9ce9\u306e\u8f2a\u90ed\u304b\u3089\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5f97\u305fUri\u306e\u5efa\u7269\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a6\u30ea\u30fb\u30c4\u30d5\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u9ce9\u3092\u6b6f\u8eca\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b", "\u9ce9\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u6b6f\u8eca\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u3092\u63a8\u6e2c", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u88fd\u306e\u6b6f\u8eca\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u6642\u8a08", "\u30a6\u30ea\u30fb\u30c4\u30d5\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u5947\u629c\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u6b6f\u8eca\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u9ce9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

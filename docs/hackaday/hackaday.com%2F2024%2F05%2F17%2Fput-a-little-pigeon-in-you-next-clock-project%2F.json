But well go out on a limb and say youve never wondered why gear teeth arent shaped like pigeons, and what a clock thats not quite a clock based around them would look like.\nIf this sounds like it has [Uri Tuchman] written all over it, give yourself a cookie. [Uri] has a thing for pigeons, and they make an appearance in nearly all his whimsical builds, from his ink-dipping machine to his intricately engraved metal mouse. For this build, pigeons are transformed into the teeth of a large, ornate wheel, cut from brass using an impressive Friedrich Deckel pantograph engraver. To put the pigeon wheel to work, [Uri] built an escapement and a somewhat crooked pendulum, plus a drive weight and dial. Its almost a clock, but not quite, since it doesnt measure time in any familiar units, and the dial has a leg rather than hands  classic [Uri].\nIt may not be [Clickspring]-level stuff, but its still a lovely piece of work, and instructive to boot. The way [Uri] figured out the profile for the meshing teeth by looking at the negative space swept out by the pigeon profiles was pretty sweet. Plus, pigeons.\n\n"}

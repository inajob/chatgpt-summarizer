Its heavily marketed and weaponized by the market: yearning for better, simpler times seems to be a core thread of the consumer economy these days. [Makerneer] combined his xilennial love of LEGO bricks with the flat tires on his log splitter to produce a 10 TPU tyre will never go flat, and provide a dopamine release every time he sees it.\nThe tyre is a custom model to fit his particular rims, but he does provide STEP and F3D files if youd like to try modifing it for your own purpose  theyre at Step 6 of the Instructable. Props to [Makerneer] for truly open-sourcing the design instead of just tossing STL files online. His build log also takes the time to point out the ways he had to modify the LEGO tyre profile to make it amenable to 3D printing: notably chamfering some of the tread pattern to eliminate bridging, which is a bit of a no-no with TPU.\nAs you can see in the (unfortunately vertical) demo video below, its a bit quite a bit squishier than a regular run-flat tyre, but that was part of [Makerneer]s design goal. He didnt like how rigid the non-pneumatic tyres hed tried were, so endevoured to design something himself; the whole LEGO thing was just for fun. If you wanted to replicate this tyre with a bit less skoosh, you need only tune the infill on your print.\nWhile only time will tell how long this LEGO-inspired add-on will continue adding whimsy to [Makerneer]s log-splitting, we have tests to show it will outperform any other plastic he might have printed. This project is probably more practical than a 3D printed bicycle tyre, which doesnt even have the side benefit of whimsy.\n"}

The only real downside is that they are limited to the twinkly sounds of metal tines being plucked by thumbs.\n[Jeremy Cook] broke the sonic possibilities wide open by converting a couple of kalimbas into capacitive-touch MIDI instruments using the Raspberry Pi Pico. He started with a small one that is curiously made of solid wood. Usually these instruments are at least partially hollow to allow air to resonate inside the body.\nAfter soldering up all the 1 M\u03a9 resistors necessary to utilize the capacitive touch capabilities of the Pico, [Jeremy] found it a bit difficult to play individual notes on such a small instrument, so he made version two out of a much larger specimen.\nThis time, [Jeremy] cooked up a custom PCB which he is calling the Pico Touch 2, which adds the necessary resistors at the SMD level for capacitive touch sensing and in turn cleans up the wiring a bit. Be sure to check it out in action after the break.\nOkay, so you dont have an iota of musical talent. You could always build a kalimba that plays itself.\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30d4\u30b3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u306e\u6539\u9020", "body": "\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u306f\u3001\u6307\u3067\u5f3e\u304f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u697d\u5668\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066MIDI\u697d\u5668\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u306f\u3001\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30d4\u30b3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u3092\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aMIDI\u697d\u5668\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b", "\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080: \u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u6f14\u594f\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c", "\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30d0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6f14\u594f\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

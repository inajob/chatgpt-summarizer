The software defined radio (SDR) gear includes a HackRF One, an Airspy Mini, a USRP B205mini, and a Nooelec NESDR with an active antenna. There are also three USB WiFi adapters, an AX210 WiFi/Bluetooth combo adapter, a uBlox GPS receiver, and a GPS-disciplined oscillator, both with QFH antennas. Theres also a CatSniffer multi-protocol IoT dongle and a Flipper Zero for good measure, and probably a bunch of other stuff we missed. Phew!\nAs for mounting all this stuff, [Bag-Builds] went the distance with a nicely designed internal frame system. Much of it is 3D printed, but the basic frame and a few rails are made from aluminum. The real hack here, though, is getting the proper USB cables for each connection. The cable lengths are just right so that nothing needs to get bundled up and cable-tied. The correct selection of adapters is a thing of beauty, too, with very little interference between the cables despite some pretty tightly packed gear.\nWhat exactly youd do with this cyberpack, other than stay the hell away from airports, police stations, and government buildings, isnt exactly clear. But it sure seems like youve got plenty of options. And yes, were aware that this is a commercial product for which no build files are provided, but if youre sufficiently inspired, were sure you could roll your own.\n\n\nThanks to [KC] for the tip on this one.", "title": "USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u3057\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002Lattepanda Sigma SBC\u3084USB\u30cf\u30d6\u3001HackRF One\u306a\u3069\u591a\u6570\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u304d\u3061\u3093\u3068\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5c02\u7528\u306eUSB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3067\u304d\u308c\u3044\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3002\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u3001\u8b66\u5bdf\u3084\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u5efa\u7269\u304b\u3089\u8ddd\u96e2\u3092\u7f6e\u304f\u7528\u9014\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u3057\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "Lattepanda Sigma SBC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad", "USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u9078\u629e\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad"]}

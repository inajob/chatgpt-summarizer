However, the tubes, the 6U5 model in particular, have become rare and remarkably hard to come by of late. When the supply dried up, [Bj\u00f8rner Sandom] decided to build a digital alternative instead.\nThe build relies on a small round IPS display, measuring an inch in diameter and with a resolution of 128115 pixels. One can only presume its round but not perfectly so. It was then fitted with a 25mm glass lens in order to give it a richer, deeper look more akin to a real Magic Eye tube. In any case, a STM32F103CBT was selected to drive the display, with the 32-bit ARM processor running at a lovely 72 MHz for fast and smooth updates of the screen.\nThe screen, controller, and supporting circuitry are all built onto a pair of PCBs and installed in a 3D-printed housing that lives atop a tube base. The idea is that the build is a direct replacement for a real 6U5 tube. The STM32 controller receives the automatic gain control voltage from the radio set its installed in, and then drives the screen to behave as a real 6U5 tube would under those conditions.\nBy virtue of the smart design, smooth updates, and that nifty glass lens, the final product is quite a thing to behold. It really does look quite similar to the genuine article. If youve got a beloved old set with a beleagured magic eye, you might find this a project worth replicating. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u5ec3\u76e4\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305fMagic Eye\uff08\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30a4\uff09\u7ba1\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u300d", "body": "Magic Eye tubes were popular for tuning on old radios, but have become rare.

Sound cards were expensive back then and, because the good ones werent very common, are expensive still for the retro gamer. But if you dont need the real thing, [polpo] has you covered with his RP2040-based ISA sound card.\nThe PicoGUS, as he calls it, primarily serves to replace the Gravis UltraSound with modern components at a low cost. It uses the RP2040s PIO to attach to an ISA bus and the RP2040s dual-core power to synthesize the audio for its primary target, but also the AdLib (OPL2), CMS/Game Blaster and Tandy 3-Voice. [polpo] sells the PicoGUS on his Tindie store, but since its open source, you can of course just make your own.\nAlthough work-in-progress, the PicoGUS is very useful to the right person and a perfect demonstration of how the RP2040s PIO can be used to interface with almost any type of protocol.\nOf couse, thats not the only way to use the PIO, you can also create a CAN bus or even add another USB port."}

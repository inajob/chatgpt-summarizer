But many people dislike having to work across the Internet with their work stored on someones servers. We get it. So does [CommonWealthRobotics], which offers CaDoodle. It is nearly a total clone of Tinkercad but runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, or even Chrome OS.\nIs it exactly Tinkercad? No, but thats not always a bad thing. For example, CaDoodle can work with Blender, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, and more. However, on the business end, it sure looks like the core functions of Tinkercad.\nThe program appears fairly new, so you have to make some allowances. For example, the Linux AppImage seems to have difficulty loading plugins (which it needs to import many of its file formats). In addition, on at least some systems, you have to resize the window after it starts, or it wont respond. But, overall, it is pretty impressive. The Settings, by the way, has a checkbox for advanced features, and there are some other goodies there, too.\nOne reason we found this interesting is that we sometimes go into schools, and they dont want us to have kids on the Internet. Of course, they dont like us installing random software either, so you can pick your battles.\nTinkercad, of course, continues to add features. Not all of which youd expect in a drawing package.", "title": "\u300cTinkercad\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044CAD\u30c4\u30fc\u30ebCaDoodle\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "body": "Tinkercad\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066CaDoodle\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306aOS\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u7279\u5fb4\u3084\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u8ab2\u984c\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cTinkercad\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044CAD\u30c4\u30fc\u30ebCaDoodle\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "\u300cCaDoodle\uff1a\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u5b50\u4f9b\u5411\u3051\u6559\u80b2\u306b\u6700\u9069\uff01CaDoodle\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u5229\u70b9\u300d", "\u300cTinkercad\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u305fCaDoodle\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01CaDoodle\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d"]}

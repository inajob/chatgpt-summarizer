It seems simple, but of course, the devil is in the details. You can see the process and the result in the video below.\nWe have to admit that he does things step-by-step. The first step was to test the GPS modules interface. Then, he tried computing the speed from it and putting the result on a display. However, testing in the field showed that the display was not suitable for outdoor use.\nThat prompted another version with an OLED screen. Picking the right components is critical. It struck us that you probably need a fast update rate from the GPS, too, but that doesnt seem to be a problem.\nThe other issue is, of course, that you have to have a GPS lock for this to work. Inside the urban canyon, you might be better served with a different method. You might think about an accelerometer, but while thats easy in theory (velocity is the integration of acceleration), in practice, errors and other issues make that a tough way to do it.\nThe project wraps up with a nice case and some special display modes. We were sorry that the code and STLs were available on request, but youd probably do it differently anyway. This isnt the first GPS speedometer weve seen. Ever wonder how fast your dog is going?\n"}

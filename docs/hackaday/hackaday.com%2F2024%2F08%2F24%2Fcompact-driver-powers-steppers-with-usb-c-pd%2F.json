Theyre everywhere, theyre well-known to hackers and makers, and yet theyre still a bit hard to integrate into projects. Thats because the motor alone isnt much use, and by the time you find or build a driver and integrate it with a microcontroller, youve probably expended more effort than you will on the rest of the project. This USB-C PD stepper driver aims to change that.\nWhat caught our eye about [Josh Rogan]s PD Stepper is his effort to make this a product rather than just a project. The driver is based on a TMC2209 for silent operation and a lot of torque thanks to the power delivery capabilities of USB-C PD. The PCB is very nicely designed and has an AS5600 rotary magnetic encoder for closed-loop operation. Theres also an ESP32-S3 on-board, so WiFi and Bluetooth operation are possible  perfect for integration into Home Assistant via ESPHome.\n[Josh]s mechanical design is top-notch, too, with a machined aluminum spacer that fits on the back of a NEMA-17 motor perfectly and acts as a heat spreader. A machined polycarbonate cover protects the PCB and makes a very neat presentation. [Josh] has kits available, or you can roll your own with the provided build files.\n\n", "title": "NEMA-17\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306eUSB-C PD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u5411\u3051", "body": "NEMA-17\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3084\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u304f\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002USB-C PD\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306f\u3001TMC2209\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u9759\u97f3\u52d5\u4f5c\u3068\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002ESP32-S3\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3001Home Assistant\u3078\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["NEMA-17\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306eUSB-C PD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u5411\u3051", "\u9759\u97f3\u52d5\u4f5c\u3068\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af: TMC2209\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eUSB-C PD\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc", "AS5600\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u642d\u8f09: USB-C PD\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc", "3\u7a2e\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09: ESP32-S3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fUSB-C PD\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc", "NEMA-17\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u9069\u7528\u53ef\u80fd: USB-C PD\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8"]}

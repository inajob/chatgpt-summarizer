Usually theyre some form of perpetual motion machine flying in the face of the laws of conservation of energy, but thats not to say that there is no free power.\nThe power just has to come from somewhere, and if youre not paying for it theres the bonus. [joekutz] has just such a project, lighting up LEDs with no power source or other active electronics.\nOf course, hes not discovered perpetual motion. Rather, while an LED normally requires a bit of current to light up properly, it seems many will produce a tiny amount of light on almost nothing. Ambient electromagnetic fields are enough, and its this effect thats under investigation. Using a phone camera and a magnifier as a light detector hes able to observe the feeble glow as the device is exposed to ambient fields.\nIn effect this is using the LED as the very simplest form of radio receiver, a crystal set with no headphone and only the leads, some wires, and high value resistors as an antenna. The LED is after all a diode, and it can thus perform as a rectifier. We like the demonstration even if we cant quite see an application for it.\nWhile were no longer taking new entries for the 2025 Component Abuse Challenge, weve still got plenty of creative hacks from the competition to show off. Were currently tabulating the votes, and will announce the winners of this particularly lively challenge soon.\n \n\n\n"}

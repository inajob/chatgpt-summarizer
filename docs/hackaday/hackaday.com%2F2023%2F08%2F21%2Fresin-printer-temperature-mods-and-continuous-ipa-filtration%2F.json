Unfortunately, most consumer MSLA printers do not come with a resin tray heater, and tossing out IPA after every cleaning session because of some resin contamination is both wasteful and somewhat expensive. These are two things that can be fixed in a number of ways, with [Nick Wilson] going for the crank it to 11 option, using a high-tech, fully integrated solution for both problems.\nThe vat with IPA is kept clean through the use of a diaphragm pump that circulates the alcohol through two filter stages, one for larger  up to 5 micrometer  particulates and one for smaller 0.5-micrometer junk. A 405 nm LED lighting section before the filters is intended to cure any resin in the IPA, theoretically leaving the IPA squeaky clean by the time its returned to the vat.\nFor the resin tray heater, a more straightforward 12V 150 Watt silicone heater strip is stuck to the outside edge of the metal resin tray, along with a temperature-controlled relay that toggles the heater strip on and off until the resin reaches the desired temperature. None of these are necessarily expensive solutions, but they can be incredibly useful if you do a fair amount of resin printing.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30b8\u30f33D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u3068IPA\u6e05\u6383\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "body": "\u71b1\u3068IPA\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002IPA\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3068\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u71b1\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u305f\u30022\u6bb5\u968e\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068405 nm\u306eLED\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u3001\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u5229\u7528\u3002\u6295\u8cc7\u984d\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u6709\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30b8\u30f33D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u3068IPA\u6e05\u6383\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "IPA\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044\uff1f", "\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u5f8c\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306aIPA\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9"]}

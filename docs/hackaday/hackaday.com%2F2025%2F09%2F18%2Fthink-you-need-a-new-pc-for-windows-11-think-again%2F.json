Still more will offer advice: which Linux distribution is best for your aging PC? [Sean] from Action Retro has an alternate solution: get a 20 year old Sun Workstation, and run Windows 11 on that.\u00a0\nThe Workstation in question from 2005 is apparently among the first Sun made using AMDs shiny new 64-bit Opteron processor. Since Windows has no legacy 32-bit support something it shares with certain Linux distributions this is amongst the oldest hardware that could conceivably install and run Redmonds latest.\nAnd it can! Not in unaltered form, of course the real hack here is courtesy of [ntdevlabs], whose Tiny11 project strips all the cruft from Windows 11, including its hardware compatibility checker. [ntdevlabs] has produced a Tiny11Builder script that is available on GitHub, but the specific version [Sean] used is available on Archive.org.\n[Sean] needed the archived version of Tiny11 because Windows 11 builds newer than 22H2 use the POPCNT operation, which was not present in AMDs first revision of the x86_64 instruction set. POPCNT is part of Intels SSE4 extension from 2007, a couple years after this workstation shipped.\nIf youre sick of being told to switch to Linux, but cant stomach staying with Windows either, maybe check out Haiku, which we reported as ready for daily driving early last year.\n\n\n"}

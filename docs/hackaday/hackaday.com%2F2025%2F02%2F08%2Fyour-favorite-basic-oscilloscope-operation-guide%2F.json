Unlike a digital multimeter with its point-and-measure functionality, digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) require fundamental knowledge before they can be used properly. Yet at the same time nobody likes reading manuals, so what is one to do? Try the Absolute Beginners Guide to DSOs\u00a0 by [Arthur Pini]\n[Pinis] Cliffs Notes version of your scopes manual isnt half bad. It covers the basic user interface and usage of a (stand-alone) DSO. Unfortunately, it focuses a bit too much on a fancy touch-screen Teledyne LeCroy MSO rather than something the average hobbyist is likely to have lying around.\nWe rather like the PSA-type videos such as the classic How not to blow up your oscilloscope video by [Dave] over at EEVBlog. Many guides and introductions cover what to do, but covering common safety issues like improper grounding, isolation, or voltages might be a better place to start.\nWhat tutorial or reference work would you hand to an oscilloscope newbie? We can endorse a hands-on approach with a suitable test board. We also enjoyed [Alans] video on the topic. Even if you are an old hand, do you know how to use all those strange trigger modes?\n\n"}

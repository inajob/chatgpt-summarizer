Well, maybe, but theres a certain exquisite flavoring to effort. Just ask [jformulate], who created these custom chocolate-topped butter cookies using a mixture of 3D printing, silicone, and of course, baking and tempering.\n[jformulate] did this project along with a makerspace group, and the first thing they did was decide on some images for the cookies. Once a hexagon-shaped mold was created in Fusion360, the images were added in. Some had to be height-adjusted in order for the detail to come out.\nOnce these positives were printed, it was time to make the food-safe silicone molds that would form the custom chocolate toppers. If you dont have a vacuum de-gasser, [jformulate] recommends pouring a thin stream from a high place to avoid air bubbles. You can always tap the mold several times on a flat surface as well to bring trapped air to the top.\nFinally, its time to make cookies. [jformulate] has good instructions for tempering chocolate, as well as a recipe for the butter cookies that support the designs. As a bonus, [jformulate] shows how to make a fish-shaped hot chocolate bomb, and made Jolly Rancher (sadly not Wrencher) medallions using the silicone molds and a microwave.\nFor the semi-disappointed, directly 3D printing cookies is definitely a thing.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u52aa\u529b\u306b\u306f\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[jformulate]\u3055\u3093\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u3001\u713c\u304d\u3084\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u7279\u88fd\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u753b\u50cf\u304c\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306b\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u578b\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc", "\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306b\u4f7f\u3046\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30b7\u30d4\u3068\u30c6\u30f3\u30d1\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

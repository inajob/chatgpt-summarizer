The microcontroller has a lot to offer, and the current crop of tiny dev boards sporting it make adding a lot of compute power to even the smallest projects dead easy. Not so nice, though, is the poor WiFi performance of some of these boards, which [Peter Neufeld] addresses with this quick and easy antenna.\nThere are currently a lot of variations of the ESP32-C3 out there, sometimes available for a buck a piece from the usual suspects. Designs vary, but a lot of them seem to sport a CA-C03 ceramic chip antenna at one end of the board to save space. Unfortunately, the lack of free space around the antenna makes for poor RF performance. [Peter]s solution is a simple antenna made from a 31-mm length of silver wire. One end of the wire is formed into a loop by wrapping it around a 5-mm drill bit and bending it perpendicular to the remaining tail. The loop is then opened up a bit so it can bridge the length of the ceramic chip antenna and then soldered across it. Thats all it takes to vastly improve performance as measured by [Peter]s custom RSSI logger  anywhere from 6 to 10 dBm better. You dont even need to remove the OEM antenna.\nThe video below, by [Circuit Helper], picks up on [Peter]s work and puts several antenna variants to further testing. He gets similarly dramatic results, with 20 dBm improvement in some cases. He does note that the size of the antenna can be a detriment to a project that needs a really compact MCU and tries coiling up the antenna, with limited success. He also did a little testing to come up with an optimal length of 34 mm for the main element of the antenna.\nThere seems to be a lot of room for experimentation here. We wonder how mounting the antenna with the loop perpendicular to the board and the main element sticking out lengthwise would work. Wed love to hear about your experiments, so make sure to ping us with your findings.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32-C3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u6539\u826f\u6cd5", "body": "ESP32-C3\u306eWiFi\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u7c21\u6613\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30ea\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5968\u52b1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32-C3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u6539\u826f\u6cd5", "- WiFi\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08", "- ESP32-C3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306eRF\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306eWiFi\u5f37\u5316\u6280\u8853\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\uff1a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3068\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5"]}

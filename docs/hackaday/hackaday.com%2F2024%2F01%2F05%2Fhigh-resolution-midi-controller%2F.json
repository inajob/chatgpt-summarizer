It remains the de facto digital interface between computers and instruments thanks to its open nature, but its age does show a little bit. Sending control change (CC) messages, for example, was originally designed to fit within seven bits, which doesnt give particularly fine resolution compared to more capable modern computers. To work around that, a fourteen-bit message is possible, doubling the resolution, and this MIDI interface uses this larger amount of data to send these high-resolution CC messages.\nThe 14-bit messages are actually fairly well documented but are a bit obscure, with very limited hardware support. To that end, [Gero] set about building this control interface to solve that problem. Its made up of only eight knobs, each of which is mapped one-to-one to a parameter on the computer, allowing the interface to feel more like an analog device where the knob corresponds directly to a change in an aspect of the sound. The platform is built around a Teensy 4.0 and some multiplexers to handle all of the knobs, with the open source software available for anyone to use to modify their actions. [Gero] was aiming for high fidelity for all aspects of this controller, not just the improved digital resolution, and made a number of other improvements to it as well like re-greasing the potentiometer knobs and a custom 3D printed enclosure.\nAll of the software is available for use, as well as the files to print the case. [Gero] is also working on a PCB to make the construction of the device a little more streamlined, but for now, it requires a bit of soldering off-the-shelf parts together. The MIDI standard is open as well, which allows for a lot of innovation in the creation of musical instruments from unique hardware. This project builds a MIDI synthesizer with parts from a Sega Genesis.", "title": "MIDI\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\uff1a\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6CC\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e8\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "MIDI\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u898f\u683c\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u7d30\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001MIDI\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["MIDI\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\uff1a\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6CC\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e8\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "Teensy\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY MIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30b7\u30b9\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMIDI\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb", "\u97f3\u697d\u696d\u754c\u3067\u4f9d\u7136\u3068\u3057\u3066\u91cd\u8981\u306aMIDI\uff1a14\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6CC\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u611f\u899a\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\uff1a8\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30d6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1", "DIY MIDI\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u9053\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

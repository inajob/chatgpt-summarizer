But why stop there?\nThats what [Jeroen Brinkman] must have been thinking while creating the Programmers Macro Pad. Based on the Arduino Pro Micro, this hand-wired pad is unique in that a single press of any of its 16 keys can virtually type out multiple lines of text. In this case, its a capability thats being used to prevent the user from having to manually enter in commonly used functions, declarations, and conditional statements.\nFor example, in the current firmware, pressing the func key will type out a boilerplate C function:\n\nint () { //\n;\nreturn 0;\n}; // f \nIt will also enter in the appropriate commands to put the cursor where it needs to be so you can actually enter in the function name. The other keys such as array and if work the same way, saving the user from having to enter (and potentially, even remember) the correct syntax.\nThe firmware is kept as simple as possible, meaning that the functionality of each key is currently hardcoded. Some kind of tool that would let you add or change macros without having to manually edit the source code and flash it back to the Arduino would be nicebut hey, it is a Programmers Macro Pad, after all.\nLooking to speed up your own day-to-day computer usage? Weve covered a lot of macro pads over the years, were confident at least a few of them should catch your eye.", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3059\u308b\u300cProgrammers Macro Pad\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u300116\u30ad\u30fc\u3067\u8907\u6570\u884c\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3001\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3059\u308b\u300cProgrammers Macro Pad\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u4e00\u3064\u3067\u8907\u6570\u884c\u5165\u529b", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u958b\u767a\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u65e5\u5e38\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

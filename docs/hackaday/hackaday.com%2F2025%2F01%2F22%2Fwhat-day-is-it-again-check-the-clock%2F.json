It can get so bad that you dont know what day of the week it is. Really. Ask us how we know.\nRather than miss a meeting (or a day off), prolific hacker [Arnov Sharma] created this day of the week clock. It uses a customized LED driver board with seven sets of three LEDs, each driven by a MOSFET. Each MOSFET is controlled by a DFRobot Mini Beetle ESP32-C3. It runs on a 2200 mAh, 3.7 V lithium-ion battery.\nWhile this is mostly PCBs, there are three printed parts that turn it into a displayable object. We really like the look of this clock  it has just the right amount of pizazz to it and reminds us of a and old movie marquee. Be sure to check out the great build instructions.\nWe love a good clock around here. In case you missed it, here is the latest from [Moritz v. Sivers] that uses a caustic lens to display the time.", "title": "- \u5728\u5b85\u52e4\u52d9\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\uff01\u66dc\u65e5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bLED\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u5728\u5b85\u52e4\u52d9\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u66dc\u65e5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5728\u5b85\u52e4\u52d9\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\uff01\u66dc\u65e5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bLED\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u66dc\u65e5\u8868\u793a\u6642\u8a08\u3067\u4ed5\u4e8b\u3068\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4fdd\u3064", "- 2200mAh\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\uff01Arduino\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u66dc\u65e5\u6642\u8a08", "- MOSFET\u5236\u5fa1\u306eLED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u6620\u753b\u770b\u677f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u9b45\u529b\uff01\u65e5\u4ed8\u8868\u793a\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u6642\u8a08"]}

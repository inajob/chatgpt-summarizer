Of course, the USB drives just think they are huge, and the solar panels dont deliver the kind of power they claim. That seems to be the case with [Big Clives] latest folding solar panel purchase. The nice thing about the Internet is you can satisfy your urge to tear things open to see whats inside of them vicariously instead of having to buy a lot of junk yourself. Thanks [Clive]!\nThe picture on the website didnt match the actual product, which was the first sign, of course. The panels output in full sun was around 2.5 watts instead of the claimed 10 watts. Hes also seen sellers claim they are between 20 and 80-watt panels. But the interesting bits are when [Clive] decides to rip the panel into pieces and analyze the controller board.\n\nThe tiny circuit board uses a buck regulator chip to feed 5V to the attached USB port. There are hardly any other components: a Schottky diode, an inductor, two capacitors, an LED, and the LEDs resistor.\nMaybe those little panels would work for a Game Boy. Weve seen some simple buck regulators before, but this one may be the most minimal.\n"}

Perhaps a regenerative receiver, or maybe a direct conversion design, itll take a couple of transistors or maybe some simple building-block analogue ICs. More complex designs for analogue radios require far more devices; if youre embarking on a superhetrodyne receiver in which an oscillator and mixer are used to generate an intermediate frequency then you know itll be a hefty project. [VK3YE] is here to explode that assumption, with a working AM broadcast band superhet that uses only two transistors.\nIt doesnt get much simpler than this.\nA modern portable radio will almost certainly use an all-in-one SDR-based chip, but in the golden age of the transistor radio the first stage of the receiver would be a single transistor that was simultaneously RF amplifier, oscillator, and mixer. The circuit in the video below does this , with a ferrite rod, the familiar red-cored oscillator coil, and a yellow-cored IF transformer filtering out the 455 kHz mixer product between oscillator and signal.\nThere would normally follow at least one more transistor amplifying the 455 kHz signal, but instead the next device is both a detector and an audio amplifier. Back in the day that would have been a germanium point contact diode, but now the transistor has a pair of 1N4148s in its biasing. Were guessing this applies a DC bias to counteract the relatively high forward voltage of a silicon diode, but we could be wrong.\nWe like this radio for its unexpected simplicity and clever design, but also because hes built it spiderweb-style. We never expected to see a superhet this simple, and even if you have no desire to build a radio we hope youll appreciate the ingenuity of using simple transistors to the max.\n\n"}

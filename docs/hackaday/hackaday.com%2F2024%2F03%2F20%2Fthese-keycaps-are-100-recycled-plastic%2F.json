Keycap maker [tellybelly] of jankycaps has been experimenting with making keycaps out of 100% recycled plastic, and offers an interesting post detailing their development and production process.\nWhat do you do when normal injection molding tooling is out of your budget, and silicone molds simply wont do? You turn to 3D printing if you can. In this case, [tellybelly] and company found a resin designed to withstand high temperatures.\n[tellybelly] was able to design the mold using a plethora of online resources, and even verified the flow using a special program. Although the first two versions worked, they had some flaws. Third times the charm, though, and then it was time to sort plastic and fire up the shredder.\nAfter heating up the shreds to 200 \u00b0C or so, it was time to start the injecting. This part isnt exactly a cakewalk  mixing different plastics together can vary the workable temperature range that doesnt degrade the plastic. Although it sounds like the end, [tellybelly] reports that they spent just as much time here as they did at the drawing board, experimenting with pressure on the mold, various cool-down methods, and how long to wait before opening the mold.\nVia reddit"}

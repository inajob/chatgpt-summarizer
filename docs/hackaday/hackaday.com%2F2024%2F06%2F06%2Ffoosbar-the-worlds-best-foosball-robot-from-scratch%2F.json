This is the same creator that built a working 32-bit computer inside a Terraria world. This time its a bit more physical of a creation: a self-playing foosball table.\nWere not sure of the impetus for this idea, but were delighted to see the engineering it took to make it work. It sounds so simple. Its just servos mounted on linear actuators, right? Oh, and some computer vision to determine where the ball actually is on the table. And the software to actually control the motors, pass the ball around, and play offense and defense. So maybe not so simple. All the code and some other resources are available under the MIT license.\nAs to while the claim of best foosball robot has an asterisk? Thats because, although weve seen a few potential competitors over the years, there isnt yet a world foosball competition. Were hoping that changes, as a tournament of robots playing foosball sounds like a sports event wed show up for!\n\n"}

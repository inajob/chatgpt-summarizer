It certainly seemed ready for light work around the farm, but its only now that we get his video showing the machine at work. This thing really can farm!\nAn MF 65 wasnt the smallest of 1960s tractors, but by todays standards its not a machine you would expect to see working a thousand acres of wheat. Instead its a typical size for a smaller operation, perhaps a mixed farm, a small livestock farm, or in this case a horticulture operation growing pumpkins. In these farms the tractor doesnt often trail up and down a field for hours, instead its used for individual smaller tasks where its carrying or lifting capacity is needed, or for smaller implements. Its in these applications that we see the electric 65 being tested, as well as some harder work such as hauling a trailer load of bales, or even harrowing a field.\nIn one sense the video isnt a hack in itself, for that you need to look at the original build. But its important to see how a hack turned out in practice, and this relatively straightforward conversion with a DC motor has we think proven itself to be more than capable of small farm tasks. Its only flaw in the video is a 30 minute running time, something he says hell be working on by giving it a larger battery pack. Wed use it on the Hackaday ancestral acres, any time!\nThe video is below the break.\n\n"}

Here at Hackaday aside from our own Supercon and Hackaday Europe events we try to take in as many as we can over the year, and thus its always interesting to sot a new one. If youre in north-west Europe next weekend, consider dropping by Hackfest, in the Dutch city of Enschede, right on the German border.\nLooking at the program and the projects and workshops\u00a0 listed on the website we can see robotics, lockpicking, demoscene, retrocomputing, and plenty of open source. There are quite a few names which have featured at times here on these pages, something which certainly piqued our interest. Finding that its only 15 Euros for a weekends admission sealed the deal, and thus its time for Hackaday to break out the trusty Interrail pass once more and make the trek. Sadly many of Hackadays community will be too far away to join us, but if youre close enough to make it then its one to consider.\nThis is a part of the world its fair to say isnt often featured on Hackaday, but some of you might remember the city as being at the centre of a Wi-Fi tracking scandal.", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304c\u96c6\u3046\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u96c6\u307e\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30bd\u30f3\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3002\u6280\u8853\u5206\u91ce\u3084\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u5171\u6709\u306e\u5834\u3067\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5de5\u5b66\u3084\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5c55\u793a\u300215\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u3067\u53c2\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u3002Enschede\u5e02\u3067\u306e\u958b\u50ac\u3002Dieckman\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304c\u96c6\u3046\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u3084\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306a\u3069\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u591a\u6570", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30a4\u304c\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u5bb6\u3092\u5fdc\u63f4", "15\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u3067\u53c2\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30a4\u304c\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0"]}

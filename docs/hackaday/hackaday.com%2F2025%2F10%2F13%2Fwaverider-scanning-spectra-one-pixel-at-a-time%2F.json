While commercial hyperspectral cameras often start in the tens of thousands of dollars, [anfractuosity] decided to make his own with the Waverider.\nTo capture spectral data from every pixel location in the camera, [anfractuosity] first needed a way to collect that data \u2014 for that, he used an AFBR-S20M2WV, a miniature USB spectrometer he picked up second-hand. This sensor allows for the collection of data from 225 nm all the way up to 1000 nm. Of course, the sensor can only do that for one single input, so to turn it into a camera, [anfractuosity] added a stepper-driven x-y stage controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico and some TMC2130 stepper drivers.\n\nWith some 3D-printed parts to hold things together and a fiber-optic cable, [anfractuosity] now had a way to move the one-pixel camera through a wide range of locations, turning that one pixel into a much larger pixel array needed to get a recognizable image out. Its not the fastest camera weve seen \u2014 with one 400 \u00d7 400 array of images taking almost 19 hours to capture \u2014 but it does produce an image that has far more than one RGB value per pixel.\nHead over to [anfractuosity]s site to check out all the images created and to find out more about this project, and check out some of our other single-pixel camera projects weve featured in the past. Or, maybe you can use your phone.\n"}

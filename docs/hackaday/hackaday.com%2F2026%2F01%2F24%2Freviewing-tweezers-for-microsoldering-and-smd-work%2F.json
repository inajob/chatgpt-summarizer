We can extend that sentiment into the digital age by saying that when philosophers get together they talk about ideas, theory, and meaning; but when hackers get together they talk about where to get the best tweezers.\nIn this video [nanofix] runs us through his collection of tweezers talking about what he likes and doesnt like for each. If youre just getting into microsoldering this video will have some tips about where you should start, and if youve been soldering tiny stuff for a while you might find some ideas for a helpful new bit of kit, or two.\nIf youre interested in tweezers and novel applications you might want to check out \u201csmart\u201d tweezers, which can read capacitance and resistance values on the fly. Or read about a suction based SMD tool, which can securely hold SMD components with less risk of them flying across the bench and disappearing forever into the carpet on the floor.\n\n"}

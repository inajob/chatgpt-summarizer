You can use software plugins, all kinds of rack-mount effects, or pedals. Or, as [David] has done, you could go with a lamp.\n[Davids] build is straightforward enough in concept\u2014he just chose a relatively unconventional item to use as a reverb tank. The lamp might seem like an odd choice, but it actually does a decent job at resonating because of its metal construction and the multiple springs that tension the structure. [David] turns the lamp into a reverb by fitting it with a Vidsonix Ghost audio transducer to put sound into the structure\u2014picture the magnetic driver of a loudspeaker without the cone fitted, and you get the idea. Piezo elements were then used as contact mics to pick up reverberations from the lamp itself. Everything was assembled with a bunch of lab stands that give the build a rather nice aesthetic. The reverb time isnt particularly long, but the sound is hauntingly beautiful.\n\nYou can use all kinds of random stuff as a reverb tank, even a trash can if so desired.\n", "title": "- \u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u306b\u3001\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u4f5c\u308a\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u975e\u5e38\u8b58\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff1a\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "- \u610f\u5916\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u97f3\u97ff\uff1a\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6", "- \u5668\u5177\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5275\u9020\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u97ff\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

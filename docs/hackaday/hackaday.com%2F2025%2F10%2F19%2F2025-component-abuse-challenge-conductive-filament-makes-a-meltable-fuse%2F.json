Or at least [JohnsonFarms.us] seems to think so, which has led him to design 3D-printed fuses made from conductive PLA filament.\nConductive filament is a meltable resistor, which, if one squints hard enough, is basically a fuse.\nIn theory a 3D printed fuse works the same as a normal one: excessive current draw will cause the conductive plastic to briefly become a heater, causing it to self-destruct and break the electrical connection. Theres a risk of melted plastic and perhaps a nonzero combustion risk, but [JohnsonFarms.us] is less interested in whether this is a good idea and more interested in whether it can work at all, and with what degree of predictability and/or regret.\nHis experiments so far show that printed fuses are essentially meltable resistors with values between 300 \u03a9 and 1250 \u03a9, depending on shape. What it takes to bring those to roughly 60 \u00b0C, where PLA softens, and around 150 \u00b0C, where PLA melts, is next on the to-do list.\nWhatever conclusions are reached, it is interesting to think of conductive filament as a meltable resistor, and ponder what unusual applications that might allow.\nMost conductive filaments have high resistance, but not all. Some, like Electrifi by Multi3D, have extremely low resistance and were used in a project that made 3d-printed logic gates.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u9ad8\u6e29\u3067\u6eb6\u3051\u308b\u7279\u6027\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u878d\u3051\u308b\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8003\u5bdf", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u691c\u8a0e", "- 3D\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5fdc\u7528"]}

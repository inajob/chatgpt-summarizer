Its farmed around the world in virtually every place that it has cropped up, most commonly on coffee plants, tea plants, and cocoa plants. But is also found in other less common plants like the yaupon holly in the southeastern United States and yerba mat\u00e9 holly in South America. For how common it is and how long humans have been consuming it, its always been a bit difficult to quantify exactly how much is in any given beverage, but [Johnowhitaker] has a solution to that.\nThis build uses a practice called thin layer chromatography, which separates the components of a mixture by allowing them to travel at different rates across a thin adsorbent layer using a solvent. Different components will move to different places allowing them to be individually measured. In this case, the solvent is ethyl acetate and when the samples of various beverages are exposed to it on a thin strip, the caffeine will move to a predictable location and will show up as a dark smudge under UV light. The smudges dimensions can then be accurately measured to indicate the caffeine quantity, and compared against known reference samples.\nAlthough this build does require a few specialized compounds and equipment, its by far a simpler and less expensive way of figuring out how much caffeine is in a product than other methods like high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography, both of which can require extremely expensive setups. Plus [Johnowhitaker]s results all match the pure samples as well as the amounts reported in various beverages so hes pretty confident in his experimental results on beverages which havent provided that information directly.\nIf you need a sample for your own lab, we covered a method on how to make pure caffeine at home a while back.\n\n"}

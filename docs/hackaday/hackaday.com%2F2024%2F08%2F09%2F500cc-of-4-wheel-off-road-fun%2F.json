[Made in Poland] has, and there he is in a new video with a little off-road buggy.\nThe video which weve paced below the break is quite long, and its one of those restful metalworking films in which we see the finished project take shape bit by bit. In this case the buggy has a tubular spaceframe, with front suspension taken from a scrap quad and a home-made solid rear axle. For power theres a 500cc Suzuki two-cylinder motorcycle engine, with a very short chain drive from its gearbox to that axle. The controls are conventional up to a point, though wed have probably gone for motorcycle style handlebars with a foot shift rather than the hand-grip shift.\nThe final machine is a pocket drift monster, and one wed certainly like to have a play with. Wed prefer some roll-over protection and we wonder whether the handling might be improved were the engine sprung rather than being part of a huge swing-arm, but it doesnt appear to interfere with the fun. If you fancy a go yourself its surprisingly affordable to make a small vehicle, just build a Hacky Racer.\n\n", "title": "DIY\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u52d5\u753b\uff1a\u30cf\u30a4\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u306a\u5192\u967a\u306e\u821e\u53f0", "body": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u88fd\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u3001DIY\u3067\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002500cc\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30a2\u30af\u30b9\u30eb\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3053\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u8eca\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u52d5\u753b\uff1a\u30cf\u30a4\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u306a\u5192\u967a\u306e\u821e\u53f0", "\u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u88fd\uff1a\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u8eca", "500cc\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u642d\u8f09\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u5b8c\u6210", "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u8cbb\u7528\u3067\u6311\u6226\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30ae\u30fc\u300c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u300d"]}

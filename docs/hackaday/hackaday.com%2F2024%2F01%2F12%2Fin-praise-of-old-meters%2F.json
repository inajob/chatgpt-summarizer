Even the cheapest meter you will get these days is almost surely digital with a tremendous input impedance. But a few decades ago, meters were almost always analog affairs. To make a precise measurement, you needed a mirror under the meter to ensure you read the needle correctly. Moreover, a common meter wouldnt have that high of an input impedance. If you spent more, you could get a VTVM and, later, one that used FETs to provide high input impedance. [Peter AA2VG] just picked up a vintage Micronta FET volt-ohm meter to join some of the other new and old meters in his shack. You can check it out in the video below.\n[Peter] already has a Simpson and a more modern Fluke meter. The Simpson, however, doesnt have a tube or FET amplifier. The Fluke is nice, but there is something about the needle on an analog meter. If you arent old enough to remember, the Micronta brand was a Radio Shack label.\n\nThe teardown and repair started just before the 11-minute mark. There were two obviously burned resistors and a leaking battery\u2014an easy repair to put this meter back into service.\nIf you werent a fan of Radio Shack, maybe Heathkit was more your style. While we like our digital meters, many people still like to use analog instruments for some tasks.\n"}

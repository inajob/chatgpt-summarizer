Even the cheapest meter you will get these days is almost surely digital with a tremendous input impedance. But a few decades ago, meters were almost always analog affairs. To make a precise measurement, you needed a mirror under the meter to ensure you read the needle correctly. Moreover, a common meter wouldnt have that high of an input impedance. If you spent more, you could get a VTVM and, later, one that used FETs to provide high input impedance. [Peter AA2VG] just picked up a vintage Micronta FET volt-ohm meter to join some of the other new and old meters in his shack. You can check it out in the video below.\n[Peter] already has a Simpson and a more modern Fluke meter. The Simpson, however, doesnt have a tube or FET amplifier. The Fluke is nice, but there is something about the needle on an analog meter. If you arent old enough to remember, the Micronta brand was a Radio Shack label.\n\nThe teardown and repair started just before the 11-minute mark. There were two obviously burned resistors and a leaking battery\u2014an easy repair to put this meter back into service.\nIf you werent a fan of Radio Shack, maybe Heathkit was more your style. While we like our digital meters, many people still like to use analog instruments for some tasks.\n", "title": "\u300c\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30fb\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3\u30bfFET\u96fb\u5727\u62b5\u6297\u8a08\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u5206\u89e3\u300d", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306a\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u73fe\u5728\u3001\u304b\u3064\u3066\u306f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306a\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9\u3084\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u306aMicronta FET volt-ohm meter\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30fb\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3\u30bfFET\u96fb\u5727\u62b5\u6297\u8a08\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u5206\u89e3\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b: \u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u3068\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb: \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f7f\u3046\u3079\u304d\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "\u300c\u4fee\u7406\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b: \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3\u30bfFET\u96fb\u5727\u62b5\u6297\u8a08\u306e\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u300d"]}

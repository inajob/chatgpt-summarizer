[Hulk] has done just that with their latest Halloween build\u2014creating a working replica of the lantern from Minecraft.\nKey to the build is the 3D printed enclosure, which faithfully mimics the look of the in-game item. By virtue of Minecrafts simplistic visual style, its a relatively straightforward print, without a lot of quirky geometry or difficult overhangs that might otherwise trip up your printer. Its printed in six parts and assembled with acrylic lenses which act to diffuse the light coming from inside.\nElectronically, an Arduino Nano runs the show. Its hooked up to a pair of NeoPixel addressable LED rings, which provide rich RGB colors on demand. Rotary pots are installed on the enclosure to enable the color to be tuned to the users desire. Power is courtesy of an 18650 lithium-ion cell and a TP4056 module ensures the battery is kept happy when charging.\nIts a fun prop build, and one that would be the perfect addition to any Minecraft costume. Except for maybe a chicken jockey, because they dont use lanterns. In any case, weve seen similar work before, too.\n\n"}

Formula One races, that is. This project by [mazur8888] uses an ESP32 to keep track of the sport, and display a live dashboard on a 2.9 tri-color LCD.\nLive is in scare quotes because updates are fetched only every 30 minutes; letting the ESP32 sleep the rest of the time gives the tiny desk gadget a smaller energy footprint. Usually thats to increase battery life, but this version of the project does not appear to be battery-powered. Here the data being fetched is about overall team rankings, upcoming races, and during a race the current occupant of the pole-position.\nTheres more than just the eInk display running on the ESP32; as with many projects these days, micro-controller is being pressed into service as a web server to host a full dashboard that gives extra information as well as settings and OTA updates. The screen and dev board sit inside a conventional 3D-printed case.\nNormally when talking Formula One, were looking into the hacks race teams make. This hack might not do anything revolutionary to track the racers, but it does show a nice use for a small e-ink module that isnt another weather display. The project is open source under a GPL3.0 license with code and STLs available on GitHub.\nThanks to [mazur8888]. If youve got something on the go with an e-ink display (or anything else) send your electrophoretic hacks in to our tips line; wed love to hear from you.", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fF1\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001F1\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fF1\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u7701\u30a8\u30cd\u8a2d\u8a08\u306eESP32\u642d\u8f09\uff01F1\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u8ffd\u8de1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u5185\u306ee-ink\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067F1\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8868\u793a", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aF1\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u3092e-ink\u3067\u8996\u899a\u5316", "- F1\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01ESP32\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

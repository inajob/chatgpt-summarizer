Formula One races, that is. This project by [mazur8888] uses an ESP32 to keep track of the sport, and display a live dashboard on a 2.9 tri-color LCD.\nLive is in scare quotes because updates are fetched only every 30 minutes; letting the ESP32 sleep the rest of the time gives the tiny desk gadget a smaller energy footprint. Usually thats to increase battery life, but this version of the project does not appear to be battery-powered. Here the data being fetched is about overall team rankings, upcoming races, and during a race the current occupant of the pole-position.\nTheres more than just the eInk display running on the ESP32; as with many projects these days, micro-controller is being pressed into service as a web server to host a full dashboard that gives extra information as well as settings and OTA updates. The screen and dev board sit inside a conventional 3D-printed case.\nNormally when talking Formula One, were looking into the hacks race teams make. This hack might not do anything revolutionary to track the racers, but it does show a nice use for a small e-ink module that isnt another weather display. The project is open source under a GPL3.0 license with code and STLs available on GitHub.\nThanks to [mazur8888]. If youve got something on the go with an e-ink display (or anything else) send your electrophoretic hacks in to our tips line; wed love to hear from you."}

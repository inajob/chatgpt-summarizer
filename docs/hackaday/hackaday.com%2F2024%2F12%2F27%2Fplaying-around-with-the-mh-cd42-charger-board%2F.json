Whether you implemented the circuit yourself, or took the easy way out and picked up one of the dirt cheap modules available online, the battery management IC is simple to work with and gets the job done.\nBut theres always room for improvement. In a recent video, [Det] and [Rich] from Learn Electronics Repair go over using a more modern battery management board thats sold online as the MH-CD42. This board, which is generally based on a clone of the IP5306, seems intended for USB battery banks  but as it so happens, plenty of projects that makers and hardware hackers work on have very similar requirements.\nSo not only will the MH-CD42 charge your lithium-ion cells when given a nominal USB input voltage (4.5  5 VDC), it will also provide essential protections for the battery. That means looking out for short circuits, over-charge, and over-discharge conditions. It can charge at up to 2 A (up from 1 A on the TP4056), and includes a handy LED battery gauge on the board. But perhaps best of all for our purposes, it includes the necessary circuitry to boost the output from the battery up to 5 V.\nIf theres a downside to this board, its that it has an automatic cut-off for when it thinks youve finished using it; a feature inherited from its USB battery bank origins. In practice, that means this board might not be the right choice for projects that arent drawing more than a hundred milliamps or so.\n\n"}

A great example of this is the Sigrok project. Creating simple devices that act like a logic analyzer is relatively easy. Whats hard is writing nice software for such a setup including protocol decoders. Sigrok has done it and since it is open, you can add your device and decode your protocol. [GloriousCow] had done the hardware part of interfacing to the 8088 in an IBM PC using an off-the-shelf logic analyzer that uses a customized version of Sigrok. But the output was a CSV file you had to process in a spreadsheet program. The next step: write a decoder for Sigrok to understand 8088 bus cycles.\nThe post covers the details of writing such a plug-in for Pulseview, the Sigrok GUI. It will also work for the command line interface if you prefer that. The code is in Python.\n\nIs this strictly necessary? No. But if youve ever tried decoding, say, serial data by looking at traces on a scope, youll agree that having the machine do the decoding for you is a boon. Decoding processor states is probably even more challenging so a way to have it done for you is welcome.\nThe logic analyzer in question, by the way, is a newer version of the DreamSourceLab analyzer weve looked at before. If you missed the first part about hooking up the analyzer to start with, we covered that, too.", "title": "Sigrok\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: 8088\u30d0\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u89e3\u8aad\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "body": "Sigrok\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u30b7\u30b0\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Python\u3067\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001IBM PC\u306e8088\u30d0\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Sigrok\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: 8088\u30d0\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u89e3\u8aad\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u3067IBM PC\u306e8088\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Sigrok GUI\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b8088\u30d0\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u30c7\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c: \u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30c7\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "DreamSourceLab\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u30668088\u30d0\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

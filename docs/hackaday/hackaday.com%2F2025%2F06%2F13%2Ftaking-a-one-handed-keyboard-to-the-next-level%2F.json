Its impressive indeed then to open the link and see [AdamLeBlanc]s Schist01. Its a wrist mounted keyboard, but with its bracket curving in front of the had to support a custom ergonomic chording keyboard, its definitely a break from the norm.\nThe wrist mount has clearly taken a lot of thought, and despite looking something like the arm of a Star Trek Borg, appears comfortable. Its extremely adjustable, and can be demounted into several different parts. Meanwhile the keyboard itself has been formed to his hand by a trial and error process involving keycaps and a clay model. theres even a thumb-operable touchpad.\nWe like this peripheral a lot, for the huge attention to detail that has gone into its design, for its boldness, and because we cant help seeing ourselves using it as the input device for a futuristic head-mounted display. For now though we dont have any futuristic silver clothing in the wardrobe, so that will have to wait. If youd like to see more, theres a video.\n\n\nThanks [Shotgun Moose] for the tip."}

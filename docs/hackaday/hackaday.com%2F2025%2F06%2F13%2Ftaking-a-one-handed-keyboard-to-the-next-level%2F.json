Its impressive indeed then to open the link and see [AdamLeBlanc]s Schist01. Its a wrist mounted keyboard, but with its bracket curving in front of the had to support a custom ergonomic chording keyboard, its definitely a break from the norm.\nThe wrist mount has clearly taken a lot of thought, and despite looking something like the arm of a Star Trek Borg, appears comfortable. Its extremely adjustable, and can be demounted into several different parts. Meanwhile the keyboard itself has been formed to his hand by a trial and error process involving keycaps and a clay model. theres even a thumb-operable touchpad.\nWe like this peripheral a lot, for the huge attention to detail that has gone into its design, for its boldness, and because we cant help seeing ourselves using it as the input device for a futuristic head-mounted display. For now though we dont have any futuristic silver clothing in the wardrobe, so that will have to wait. If youd like to see more, theres a video.\n\n\nThanks [Shotgun Moose] for the tip.", "title": "- \u8155\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cSchist01\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u8155\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3059\u308b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9Schist01\u306f\u3001 ergonomic\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8155\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cSchist01\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u624b\u306b\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30a8\u30eb\u30b4\u30ce\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u300c\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u98a8\u306e\u8155\u90e8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u6301\u3064\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "- \u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u5165\u529b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u305f\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668"]}

Thats why tools that let you listen in on two systems talking are especially valuable.\nIf you were a well-funded lab back in the RS232 days, you might have an HP4957A protocol analyzer. The good news is that if you still use RS232, these kinds of things are now cheap on the surplus market. [IMSAI Guy] got one of these decidedly cool devices and shows it to us in the video below.\nThe look of these was pretty neat for their time\u2014a folded-up instrument with a cute keyboard and a CRT-100. You can load different interpreters from ROM to RAM, such as the VT-100, which is essentially an application for the device. Of course, now you could rig one of these up in a few minutes with a PC or even a Pi Pico. But it wouldnt have the same charm, we are sure you would agree.\nYou can find a lot of old RS232 gear around, from breakout boxes to advanced sniffers like this one. Too bad we couldnt afford them when we really needed them.\nThis could be handy if you have a lot of ports. Either real or virtual. Or, do it yourself.\n\n", "title": "- RS232\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u540c\u58eb\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u3068\u6b74\u53f2\u3002", "titles": ["- RS232\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u9593\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308bRS232\u95a2\u9023\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u53e4\u3044RS232\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u6027", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

The Mellotron used lots of individual tape mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Trans-Harmonium from [Emily Francisco] uses an altogether more curious method of generating sound  each key on this keyboard instrument turns on a functional clock radio.\nElectrically, theres not a whole lot going on. The clock radios have their speaker lines cut, which are then rejoined by pressing their relevant key on the keyboard. As per [Emily]s instructions for displaying the piece, its intended that the radio corresponding to C be tuned in to a local classical station. Keys A, B, D, E, F, and G are then to be tuned to other local stations, while the sharps and flats are to be tuned to the spaces in between, providing a dodgy mix of static and almost-there music and conversation.\nIts an interesting art piece that, no matter how well you play it, will probably not net you a Grammy Award. That would be missing the point, though, as its more a piece about Collecting Fragments of Time, a broader art project of which this piece is a part.\nWe do love a good art piece, especially those that repurpose old hardware to great aesthetic achievement.\n\n"}

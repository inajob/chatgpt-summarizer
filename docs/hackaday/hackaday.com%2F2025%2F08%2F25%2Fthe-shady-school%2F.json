Of course, this presupposes you have WebGPU enabled in your browser which means no Firefox or Safari. It looks like you can do some exercises without WebGPU, but the cool ones will need you to use a Chrome-style browser.\nYou can search by level of difficulty, so maybe start with Intro and try doing the fragment shader. Youll notice they already provide some code for you along with a bit of explanation. It also shows you a picture of what you should draw and what you really drew. You get a percentage based on the matching. Theres also a visual diff that can show you whats different about your picture from the reference picture.\nWe admit that one is pretty simple. Consider moving on to Easy with options like two images blend, for example. There are problems at every level of difficulty. Although there is a part for compute shaders, none seem to be available yet. Too bad, because thats what we find most interesting. If you prefer a different approach, there are other tutorials out there.", "title": "- GPU\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306eShader Academy", "body": "shaderacademy.com\u306f\u3001GPU\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3002\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30672D/3D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u8ab2\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u5225\u306b\u6311\u6226\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- GPU\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306eShader Academy", "- WebGPU\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b2D\u30fb3D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "- \u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u5225\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30b7\u30a7\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u6f14\u7fd2\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u6bd4\u8f03\u3067\u6210\u9577\u3092\u5b9f\u611f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5b66\u7fd2\u6cd5", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30a7\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

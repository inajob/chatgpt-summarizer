Ships at sea and the land-based stations that supported them used Morse code for decades, but with the growing use of satellites, maritime Morse code ended in 1999. With one notable exception. [Saahil Desai] writing in the Atlantic tells the story of\u00a0 Americas last Morse code station, KPH just north of San Francisco.\nIn fact, KPH did shut down in 1997 as part of the wind down of Morse code in ocean vessels. But some radio enthusiasts, including [Tom Horsfall] and [Richard Dillman], have brought the venerable station back to life. The radio squirrels, as they call themselves, dutifully send news and weather every Saturday to anyone interested in listening. They also exchange radio traffic, primarily with the SS Jeremiah OBrien, a World War II-era ship parked nearby. N2FQ visited the station and operated the station on video, which you can see below. Or, check out the tour in the second video, below.\n\nThere are still a few niches of Morse code, including, of course, the amateur radio community. Code isnt that hard to learn, it is dead easy to make a computer send it and only moderately hard to receive it. Making a transmitter to send the code is also easy, or feel free to whistle, thump, or use a flashlight in an emergency.\nIf you want to listen to the rechristened K6KPH or the official KPH station, you can find their pages at the Maritime Radio Historical Societys web site. Just the thing for your SDR or even a web-based receiver.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3001\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u5317\u90e8\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "body": "\u30bf\u30a4\u30bf\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u53f7\u306f\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u822a\u6d77\u306e\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u306b\u906d\u96e3\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30011999\u5e74\u306b\u306f\u6d77\u6d0b\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u306e\u5317\u306b\u3042\u308bKPH\u306f\u30011997\u5e74\u306b\u9589\u9396\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u304c\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u958b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306f\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u5929\u6c17\u3092\u6bce\u9031\u9001\u4fe1\u3057\u3001\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6226\u6642\u306e\u8239\u8236\u3068\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3001\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30b3\u5317\u90e8\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u7526\u308b\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40KPH", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u53d7\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3067\u306e\u7dca\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

While thats still true, these days wed rather see a cool display of some kind on the porch. Although some might consider this a trick, gaze into [Tim]s mirror and youll be treated to a spooky version of yourself.\nHeres how it works: At the heart of this build is a webcam, OpenCV, and a computer thats running the Stable Diffusion AI image generator. The image is shown on a monitor that sits behind 2-way mirrored glass.\nWe really like the frame that [Tim] built for this. Unable to find something both suitable and affordable, they built one out of wood molding and aged it appropriately.\nWe also like the ping pong ball vanity globe lights and the lighting effect itself. Not only is it spooky, it lets the viewer know that something is happening in the background. All the code and the schematic are available if youd like to give this a go.\nThere are many takes on the spooky mirror out there. Heres one that uses a terrifying 3D print.", "title": "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u7279\u96c6\uff1a\u93e1\u306b\u6620\u308b\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u306a\u59ff", "body": "Halloween\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u7279\u96c6\uff1a\u93e1\u306b\u6620\u308b\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u306a\u59ff", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\uff1a\u93e1\u306b\u6620\u308b\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u306a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u306a\u93e1\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30d5\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u306a\u93e1\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u93e1\u306b\u6620\u308b\u6050\u308d\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8"]}

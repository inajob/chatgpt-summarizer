[David Buchanan] has written a piece investigating glitching attacks on PC memory, and the tool hes used is the ubiquitous piezoelectric lighter.\nAttaching a short piece of wire to one of the lines on a SODIMM memory module, he can glitch a laptop at will with the lighter through the electromagnetic noise its discharge creates. Its a cool trick, but the real meat of the write-up lies in his comprehensive description of how virtual memory works, and how a glitch can be used to break out of the sandbox of memory allocated to a particular process. He demonstrates it in a video which weve placed below the break, in which he gains root access and runs an arbitrary piece of code on a Linux laptop. Its probable that not many of us have the inclination to do this for ourselves, but even so its fascinating to know how such an attack works.\n\n"}

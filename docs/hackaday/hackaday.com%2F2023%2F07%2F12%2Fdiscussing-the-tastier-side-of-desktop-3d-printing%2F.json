After all, plastic is only good for so much, and theres plenty of other interesting types of goop that lend themselves to systematic squirting. Clay, cement, wax, solder, even biological material. The possibilities are vast, and even today, were still exploring new ways to utilize additive manufacturing.\nEllie Weinstein\nBut while most of the research has centered on the practical, theres also been interest in the tastier applications of 3D printing. Being able to print edible materials offers some fascinating culinary possibilities, from producing realistic marbling in artificial steaks to creating dodecahedron candies with bespoke fillings. Unfortunately for us, the few food-safe printers that have actually hit the market havent exactly been intended for the DIY crowd.\nThat is, until now. After nearly a decade in development, Ellie Weinsteins Cocoa Press chocolate 3D printer kit is expected to start shipping before the end of the year. Derived from the Voron 0.1 design, the kit is meant to help those with existing 3D printing experience expand their repertoire beyond plastics and into something a bit sweeter.\nSo who better to host our recent 3D Printing Food Hack Chat? Ellie took the time to answer questions not just about the Cocoa Press itself, but the wider world of printing edible materials. While primarily designed for printing chocolate, with some tweaks, the hardware is capable of extruding other substances such as icing or peanut butter. Its just a matter of getting the printers in the hands of hackers and makers, and seeing what theyve got an appetite for.\n\nSo, why chocolate? Its a pretty straightforward question to start the chat on, but Ellies answer might come as a surprise. It wasnt due to some love of chocolate or desire to print custom sweets, at least, not entirely. She simply thought it would be an easy material to work with when she started tinkering with the initial versions of her printer back in 2014. The rationale was that it didnt take much energy to melt, and that it would return to a solid on its own at room temperature. While true, this temperature sensitivity ended up being exactly why it was such a challenge to work with.\nCocoa Press in 2018\nFor example, the early version of the Cocoa Press Hackaday covered back when Ellie showed it off at the 2018 World Maker Faire in New York had an elaborate system of producing cold air using water-cooled Peltier units, which would blow across the chocolate as it exited the massive heating element. It worked, but it was a complex and expensive way to pump out custom chocolate shapes.\nEllie explained that the key was to experiment with different chocolate formulations, which ultimately allowed the temperature at which it melted and solidified to be fine-tuned. This, in turn, allowed the printers hardware to be simplified. Its an interesting trade-off between chemistry and engineering, and though it does mean the printer needs to use its own custom chocolate blend, its worth it for the printers vastly reduced part count and cost.\nFor you amateur Willy Wonkas out there, the chat diverges at this point into a discussion of just what goes into common chocolaty treats. Its not the sort of thing we often see in the Hack Chat, but it was fascinating nonetheless. We wont dive too deeply into it here, but the short version is that the base of the chocolate (cocoa butter, palm oil, etc) determines how it responds to different temperatures and whether or not it requires tempering to achieve the desired snap when you bite into it. Never knew that chocolate needed to be tempered? Neither did we. Ellie says thats why a chocolate bar thats been melted is never quite the same afterwards, even if you try and throw it in the refrigerator to solidify it again.\nIn the end, Ellie says her formula for compound chocolate (containing palm oil and cocoa solids) prints at 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F) and doesnt require either a heated bed or an enclosed chamber. She does note however that theres an upper limit on the ambient temperature of the room  with print quality falling off at temperatures beyond 26 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F). As an interesting aside, thats about the minimum temperature youd be shooting for with an enclosed printer when working with common thermoplastics like PLA and PETG.\nWhite chocolate text printed on commercially produced bars.\nAs for the mechanics of the extruder, thats also gone through a few variations over the years. Early on Ellie was using air pressure to force the material out of the heated chamber, which had certain advantages, but again added complexity to the design. The final hardware, like most of the DIY paste-extruding printers weve seen, uses a motorized plunger. While a simple and reliable way to extrude thick substances like chocolate, one issue pointed out during the chat was the formation of air bubbles. The original pneumatic system handled them in stride, but with a physical plunger the bubbles need to be worked out of the material  usually by heating it up and vibrating the chamber. Several methods of automating this process were suggested, including using custom G-code or a small unbalanced motor to shake the extruder.\nChocolate printed with various infill patterns.\nSpeaking of custom G-code, one member of the chat asked if Ellie had experimented with pausing the printer at a given layer height so that the inside of the printed chocolate object can be accessed. She confirmed this can be done using the mechanism built into PrusaSlicer, and that shes had good luck adding various solid and liquid fillings to objects mid-print. This naturally lead to a discussion about the various infill methods available, and how they would impact the types and amounts of fillings that would be possible via this method.\nTowards the end of the chat, the discussion focused on whats perhaps one of the least pleasant aspects of printing edible materials: clean up. Not only does the printer need to be cleaned to make sure it keeps working properly, but its obviously critical that everything is properly washed to prevent any bacterial growth that could compromise future prints. To that end, Ellie explained that its critical to limit the number of parts that actually touch the foodstuffs  on the Cocoa Press theres only four. Its also important that those parts be easily removable without the aid of tools, and that they be made of a food-safe material such as stainless steel.\nWed like to thank Ellie Weinstein for taking the time to talk with us about her experience developing the Cocoa Press, its a project weve been following on these pages for several years now, and were excited to finally see it so close to commercial release. Over the years weve seen several attempts at developing food printers, from both the hobby community and commercial players, but nothing managed to stick the landing. Heres hoping that the Cocoa Press finally breaks the moldliterally and figuratively.\n\nThe Hack Chat is a weekly online chat session hosted by leading experts from all corners of the hardware hacking universe.

Making your own mechanical watch from scratch falls under that umbrella, too. And yet, [John Raffaelli] did just that, and prevailed!\nThats a lot of work.\nOnly a handful of components were purchased\u2014[John] grabbed jewels, sapphire crystals, the strap, and the hairspring and mainspring off the shelf. Everything else, he made himself, using a fine touch, a sharp eye, and some deft work on his machine tools. If youve never worked at this scale before, its astounding to see\u2014[John] steps through how he produced tiny pinions and balance wheels that exist at sub-fingertip scale. Even just assembling something this tiny would be a challenge, but [John] was able to craft it all from scratch and put it together into a functioning timepiece when he was done.\nThe final piece doesnt just look great\u2014were told it keeps good time as well. People like [John] dont come along every day, though we do have one similar story in our deep archives from well over a decade ago. If youre cooking up your own bespoke time pieces in your home workshop, dont hesitate to drop your story on the tipsline!"}

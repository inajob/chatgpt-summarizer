Making your own mechanical watch from scratch falls under that umbrella, too. And yet, [John Raffaelli] did just that, and prevailed!\nThats a lot of work.\nOnly a handful of components were purchased\u2014[John] grabbed jewels, sapphire crystals, the strap, and the hairspring and mainspring off the shelf. Everything else, he made himself, using a fine touch, a sharp eye, and some deft work on his machine tools. If youve never worked at this scale before, its astounding to see\u2014[John] steps through how he produced tiny pinions and balance wheels that exist at sub-fingertip scale. Even just assembling something this tiny would be a challenge, but [John] was able to craft it all from scratch and put it together into a functioning timepiece when he was done.\nThe final piece doesnt just look great\u2014were told it keeps good time as well. People like [John] dont come along every day, though we do have one similar story in our deep archives from well over a decade ago. If youre cooking up your own bespoke time pieces in your home workshop, dont hesitate to drop your story on the tipsline!", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a8\u30ea\u306e\u6210\u529f\u7269\u8a9e", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a8\u30ea\u6c0f\u306e\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a8\u30ea\u306e\u6210\u529f\u7269\u8a9e", "- \u5fcd\u8010\u3068\u6280\u8853\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff1a\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u751f\u3080\u5927\u304d\u306a\u6210\u679c\uff1a\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u5de5\u623f\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c\uff1a\u4e88\u60f3\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3068\u7f8e\u3057\u3055", "- \u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u6642\u9593\u3092\u523b\u3080\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b"]}

Sure, youve seen meters that have true RMS settings, but what does it mean? If you dont know  or you want a refresher  watch [Prof MADs] recent video explaining the topic.\nThere are two things to remember when working with RMS. If you put, say, 100VDC through a 100-ohm resistor, youll draw 1A and use 100W of power. However, since AC gradually makes its way to a peak value and then starts ramping down immediately, you cant use the peak value or anything like it to figure out AC power. After all, the voltage is only at that peak for an instant. Thats where RMS comes in. 100 VAC RMS through a 100-ohm resistor will also consume an average of 100W over time.\n\nThe other thing to remember is that we use shortcuts for sine waves where we take the peak voltage and divide by the square root of 2. That only works for sine waves. For anything else, you need either hairy math or some way to directly measure the power.\nRMS is one of those details a lot of people miss so weve seen other explanations for it. If you want to derive the math for an arbitrarily complex AC waveform, you are probably going to need some calculus.\n"}

Of course, like most things, the details are what get you. About a year ago, [Bystroushaa] tried it without success. But the second time turned out to be the charm.\nOf course, success is a relative term. It does work, but there is concern that it wont be sufficient in the winter. In addition, if the battery dies, everything doesnt restart automatically. Still, it is usable, and there should be ways to solve those problems.\nThe original attempt used a PiJuice hat and solar panel. This time, the design didnt use these, opting instead for a LiFePO4 battery, a solar regulator, and a solar panel. The rest of it comes down to mechanical and physical mounting. The cheap regulator has some drawbacks. For example, it doesnt allow for monitoring like more expensive units. It also cannot balance the cells periodically, although that could be done with an external controller.\nWeve seen solar-powered Pi boards before. Or, try a Game Boy."}

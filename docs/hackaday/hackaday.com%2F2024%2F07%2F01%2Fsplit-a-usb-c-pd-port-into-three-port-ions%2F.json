Well then, check out [bluepylons]s USB-C splitter, which takes a single USB-C 5V/3A port and splits it into three 5V/1A plugs, wonderful for charging a good few devices on the go!\nThis adapter does things right  it actually checks that 3A is provided, using a comparator, uses that to switch power to the three outputs, and correctly signals to the consumer devices that they may consume about 1A from the plugs. This hacks documentation is super considerate  you get detailed instructions on how to reproduce it, every nuance you might want to keep in mind, and even different case options depending on whether you want to pot the case or instead use a thermal pad for a specific component which might have dissipate some heat during operation!\nThis hack has been documented with notable care for whoever might want to walk the journey of building one for themselves, so if you ever need a splitter, this one is a wonderful weekend project you are sure to complete. Wonder what kind of project would be a polar opposite, but in all the best ways? Why, this 2kW USB-PD PSU, most certainly.", "title": "USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30923\u3064\u306b\u5206\u5272\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u79fb\u52d5\u4e2d\u306b\u8907\u6570\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u6642\u306b\u306f\u3001USB-C\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30021\u3064\u306eUSB-C 5V/3A\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30923\u3064\u306e5V/1A\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u306b\u5206\u5272\u3057\u3001\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u540c\u6642\u306b\u5145\u96fb\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30923\u3064\u306b\u5206\u5272\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "USB-C 5V/3A\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30923\u3064\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u306b\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "USB-C\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc: 1\u3064\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u30893\u3064\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u5145\u96fb\u3059\u308b", "\u81ea\u4f5cUSB-C\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc: 1\u3064\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u30893\u3064\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3078", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01USB-C\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

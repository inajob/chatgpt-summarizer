Running it over wireless power, of course!\n[atomic14] has been interested in wireless power for a while, and while most of the hardware hes tested over the years has been less than impressive, he demonstrates one thats able to reliably deliver 5 V at about 1 A which is more than enough to boot a Raspberry Pi W2 into X and launch DOOM. But while thats neat, he explains that wireless power isnt quite yet an effortless solution.\nThe hardware can deliver 5 V at about 1 A wirelessly, which is plenty, but coil alignment is critical to efficiency.\nFor one thing, the hardware hes using  similar to those used for mobile phone charging  need the receiver to be very close to the transmitter. In addition, they need to be aligned well or efficiency drops off sharply. For mobile phones this isnt much of a problem, but its difficult to position a Raspberry Pi and display just so when one cant see the coils. Misalignment means brownouts and other unreliable operation.\nSo while the wireless power is capable of running the Pi directly, [atomic14] attempts to put a small battery and charger circuit into the mix in order to make the whole thing both portable and more reliable. But because nothing is easy, he discovers that his charging board  which should be able to output as low as 4.5 V  isnt able to be adjusted down any lower than 5.66 V. It turns out that a resistor marked 104 (which should be 100 k\u03a9) is actually measuring 57 k\u03a9, and the trim pot doesnt go lower than 10 k\u03a9. The solution is a bit of component swapping, but we suppose its a reminder that sometimes with cheap parts, one pays in other ways.\nYou can see [atomic14]s wireless power Raspberry Pi running the classic shooter in the video below. Wireless power may have its issues, but its certainly a lot less messy than running DOOM with a gigantic potato battery.\n\n\nThanks to [Chris] for the tip!", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Raspberry Pi Zero\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066DOOM\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3068\u540c\u3058\u304f\u3089\u3044\u826f\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306f\u3001\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u96fb\u529b\u3067\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\uff01[atomic14]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u96fb\u529b\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u552f\u4e00\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u96fb\u529b\u306f\u307e\u3060\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5408\u308f\u305b\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u307e\u305f\u3001\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[atomic14]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u6027\u3068\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u3068\u5145\u96fb\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u8a66\u307f\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u76f4\u9762\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u52b9\u7387\u306a\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u5145\u96fb\u56de\u8def\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u4f9b\u7d66\u3067DOOM\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059Raspberry Pi\u306e\u5b9f\u6f14\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa"]}

This can present a problem for young children however, for whom a simpler physical interface may be an easier way to play those tunes. Maintaining a library of CDs is not entirely convenient either, so [JakesMD] has created the Yaydio. Its a music player for kids, that plays music when a card is inserted in its slot.\nAs you might expect, the cards themselves do not contain the music. Instead they are NFC cards, and the player starts the corresponding album from its SD card when one is detected. The hardware is simple enough, an Arduino Nano with modules for MP3 playback, NFC reading, seven segment display, and rotary encoder. The whole thing lives in a kid-friendly 3D printed case.\nSome thought has been given to easily adding albums and assigning cards to them, making it easy to keep up with the youngsters tastes. This isnt the first such kid-friendly music player weve seen, but its certainly pretty neat."}

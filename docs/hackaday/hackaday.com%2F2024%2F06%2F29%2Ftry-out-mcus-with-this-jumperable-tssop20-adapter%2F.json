Devboards might be hard to get, not expose everything, or carry a premium price. [Willmore] has faced this problem with an assortment of new WCH-made MCUs, and brings us all a solution  a universal board for TSSOP20-packaged MCUs, breadboard-friendly and adaptable to any pinout with only a few jumpers on the underside.\nThe board brings you everything you might want from a typical MCU breakout  an onboard 3.3V regulator, USB series resistors, a 1.5K pullup, decoupling capacitors, and a USB-C port. All GPIOs are broken out, and theres a separate header you can wire up for all your SWD/UART/USB/whatever needs  just use the patch panel on the bottom of the board and pick the test points you want to join. [Willmore] has used these boards for the CH32Vxxx family, and they could, no doubt, be used for more  solder your MCU on, go through the pin table in the datasheet, do a little point-to-point wiring, and you get a pretty functional development board.\n\nEverything is open-source  order a few of these boards from your fab of choice, and you wont ever worry about a breakout for a TSSOP20 MCU or anything that would fit the same footprint. It could even be used in a pinch for something like an I2C GPIO expander. This is also a technique worth keeping in mind  a step above the generic footprint breakouts. Looking for more universal breakouts to keep? Heres one for generic LCD/OLED panel breakouts."}

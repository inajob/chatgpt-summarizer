Devboards might be hard to get, not expose everything, or carry a premium price. [Willmore] has faced this problem with an assortment of new WCH-made MCUs, and brings us all a solution  a universal board for TSSOP20-packaged MCUs, breadboard-friendly and adaptable to any pinout with only a few jumpers on the underside.\nThe board brings you everything you might want from a typical MCU breakout  an onboard 3.3V regulator, USB series resistors, a 1.5K pullup, decoupling capacitors, and a USB-C port. All GPIOs are broken out, and theres a separate header you can wire up for all your SWD/UART/USB/whatever needs  just use the patch panel on the bottom of the board and pick the test points you want to join. [Willmore] has used these boards for the CH32Vxxx family, and they could, no doubt, be used for more  solder your MCU on, go through the pin table in the datasheet, do a little point-to-point wiring, and you get a pretty functional development board.\n\nEverything is open-source  order a few of these boards from your fab of choice, and you wont ever worry about a breakout for a TSSOP20 MCU or anything that would fit the same footprint. It could even be used in a pinch for something like an I2C GPIO expander. This is also a technique worth keeping in mind  a step above the generic footprint breakouts. Looking for more universal breakouts to keep? Heres one for generic LCD/OLED panel breakouts.", "title": "TSSOP20\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306eMCU\u7528\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3063\u3053\u3044\u3044MCU\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001[Willmore]\u3055\u3093\u304cTSSOP20\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8MCU\u7528\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023.3V\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3084USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u304c\u5099\u308f\u308a\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u30d4\u30f3\u30a2\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["TSSOP20\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306eMCU\u7528\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044MCU\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "TSSOP20 MCU\u7528\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u624b\u9806", "CH32Vxxx\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306aMCU\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u6c4e\u7528LCD/OLED\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u5411\u3051\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9"]}

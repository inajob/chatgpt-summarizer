[Kliment] gave an impassioned\u00a0invitation for everyone to start making hardware based on his experience both in the industry and in giving an intro-to-surface-mount workshop to maybe thousands of hackers over the years.\nHis main points are that the old hardware is hard cliche is overdone. Of course, working on a complicated high-reliability medical device isnt childs play, but thats not where you start off. And getting started in hardware design and hobby-scale manufacture has never been easier or cheaper, and the open-source tooling gives you a foot in the door.\nHe tells the story of an attendee at a workshop who said I kept waiting for the hard part to come, but then I was finished.\u00a0 Starting off with the right small-scale projects, learning a few techniques, and ramping up skills built on skills is the way to go. ([Kliment] is a big proponent of hand-placed hot-plate reflow soldering, and we concur.)\nThis is the talk that you want to show to your software friends who are hardware-curious. Its also a plea for more experimentation, more prototyping, more hacking, and simply more people in the hardware / DIY electronics scene. Here at Hackaday, its maybe preaching to the choir, but sometimes its just nice to hear saying it all out loud.", "title": "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6249\u3092\u958b\u3053\u3046\u300d", "body": "39C3\u3067\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u304c\u8a9e\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u304c\u5f37\u8abf\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6249\u3092\u958b\u3053\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u7c21\u5358\uff01\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580\u300d", "\u300c\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u8a66\u4f5c\u3067\u5e83\u304c\u308bDIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u300d", "\u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u88fd\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u6cd5\u300d"]}

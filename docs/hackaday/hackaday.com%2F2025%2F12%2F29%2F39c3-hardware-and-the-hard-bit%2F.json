[Kliment] gave an impassioned\u00a0invitation for everyone to start making hardware based on his experience both in the industry and in giving an intro-to-surface-mount workshop to maybe thousands of hackers over the years.\nHis main points are that the old hardware is hard cliche is overdone. Of course, working on a complicated high-reliability medical device isnt childs play, but thats not where you start off. And getting started in hardware design and hobby-scale manufacture has never been easier or cheaper, and the open-source tooling gives you a foot in the door.\nHe tells the story of an attendee at a workshop who said I kept waiting for the hard part to come, but then I was finished.\u00a0 Starting off with the right small-scale projects, learning a few techniques, and ramping up skills built on skills is the way to go. ([Kliment] is a big proponent of hand-placed hot-plate reflow soldering, and we concur.)\nThis is the talk that you want to show to your software friends who are hardware-curious. Its also a plea for more experimentation, more prototyping, more hacking, and simply more people in the hardware / DIY electronics scene. Here at Hackaday, its maybe preaching to the choir, but sometimes its just nice to hear saying it all out loud."}

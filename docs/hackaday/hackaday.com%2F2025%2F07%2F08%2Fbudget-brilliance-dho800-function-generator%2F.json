However, there\u2019s room for enhancements. [Matthias] realized that while software mods exist to increase bandwidth or unlock logic analyzer functions, the hardware needed to implement the function generator\u2014available in the more expensive DHO900 series\u2014was missing.\nTo address this, he designed a daughterboard to serve as the function generator hardware, enabling features that software tweaks can unlock. His goal was to create an affordable, easy-to-produce, and easy-to-assemble interface board that fits in the space reserved for the official daughterboard in higher-end scopes.\nOnce the board is installed and the software is updated, the new functionality becomes available. [Matthias] clearly explains some limitations of his implementation. However, these shortcomings are outweighed by the tremendous value this mod provides. A 4-channel, 200 MHz oscilloscope with function generator capabilities for under $500 is a significant achievement. We love seeing these Rigol mods enhance tool functionality. Thanks, [Matthias], for sharing this project\u2014great job bringing even more features to this popular scope.", "title": "- Rigol\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u767a\u751f\u5668\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u6700\u65b0MOD", "body": "Rigol\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\u3059\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- Rigol\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u767a\u751f\u5668\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u6700\u65b0MOD", "- DHO800\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u62e1\u5f35: \u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092500\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u624b\u9803\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c: Rigol\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- [Matthias]\u304c\u8a9e\u308bRigol\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35"]}

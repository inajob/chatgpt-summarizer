A case in point: those tiny displays originally sold as Nintendo amiibo emulators. Thanks to [ATC1441], one of these pocket-sized gadgets has been transformed into 2.4 GHz spectrum analyzer.\nThese emulators are built around the Nordic nRF52832 SoC, the same chip found in tons of low-power Bluetooth devices, and most versions come with either a small LCD or OLED screen plus a coin cell or rechargeable LiPo. Because they all share the same core silicon, [ATC1441]\u2019s hack works across a wide range of models. Don\u2019t expect lab-grade performance; the analyzer only covers the range the Bluetooth chip inside supports. But that\u2019s exactly where Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and a dozen other protocols fight for bandwidth, so it\u2019s perfect for spotting crowded channels and picking the least congested one.\nFlashing the custom firmware is dead simple: put the device into DFU mode, drag over the .zip file, and you\u2019re done. All the files, instructions, and source are up on [ATC1441]\u2019s PixlAnlyzer GitHub repo. Check out some of the other amiibo hacks weve featured as well.\n\n\n"}

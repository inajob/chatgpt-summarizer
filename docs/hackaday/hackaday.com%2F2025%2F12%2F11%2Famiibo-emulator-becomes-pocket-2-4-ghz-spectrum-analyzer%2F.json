A case in point: those tiny displays originally sold as Nintendo amiibo emulators. Thanks to [ATC1441], one of these pocket-sized gadgets has been transformed into 2.4 GHz spectrum analyzer.\nThese emulators are built around the Nordic nRF52832 SoC, the same chip found in tons of low-power Bluetooth devices, and most versions come with either a small LCD or OLED screen plus a coin cell or rechargeable LiPo. Because they all share the same core silicon, [ATC1441]\u2019s hack works across a wide range of models. Don\u2019t expect lab-grade performance; the analyzer only covers the range the Bluetooth chip inside supports. But that\u2019s exactly where Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and a dozen other protocols fight for bandwidth, so it\u2019s perfect for spotting crowded channels and picking the least congested one.\nFlashing the custom firmware is dead simple: put the device into DFU mode, drag over the .zip file, and you\u2019re done. All the files, instructions, and source are up on [ATC1441]\u2019s PixlAnlyzer GitHub repo. Check out some of the other amiibo hacks weve featured as well.\n\n\n", "title": "\u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u30672.4GHz\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3057\u305famiibo\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002", "titles": ["\u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046", "Nintendoamiibo\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u6539\u9020", "Bluetooth\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u6613\u7684\u306a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6e2c\u5b9a", "DFU\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff01\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8", "\u6df7\u96d1\u3057\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u30c1\u30e3\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

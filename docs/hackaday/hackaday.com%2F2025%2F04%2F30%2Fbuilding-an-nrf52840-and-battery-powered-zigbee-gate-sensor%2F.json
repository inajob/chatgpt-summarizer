The construction plans and design for the unit are detailed in a blog post. At the core is the MS88SF2 SoM by Minew, which features a Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 SoC that provides the Zigbee RF feature as well as the usual MCU shenanigans.\nPreviously [Glen] had created a similar system that featured buttons to turn the garden lights on or off, as nobody likes stumbling blindly through a dark garden after returning home. Rather than having to fumble around for a button, the system should detect when said rear gate is opened. This would send a notification to [Glen]s phone as well as activate the garden lights if its dark outside.\nAlthough using a reed relay switch seemed like an obvious solution to replace the buttons, holding it closed turned out to require too much power. After looking at a few commercial examples, he settled for a Hall effect sensor solution with the Ti DRV5032FB in a TO-92 package.\nWhereas the average person would just have put in a PIR sensor-based solution, this Zigbee solution does come with a lot more smart home creds, and does not require fumbling around with a smartphone or yelling at a voice assistant to turn the garden lights on.", "title": "\u30ba\u30a3\u30b0\u30d3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5ead\u5712\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "Glen Akins\u306f\u3001Zigbee\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5ead\u306e\u706f\u308a\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ba\u30a3\u30b0\u30d3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5ead\u5712\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8", "Lithium\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u51ac\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u305fZigbee\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u81ea\u52d5\u5ead\u5712\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u70b9\u706f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30cf\u30eb\u52b9\u679c\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5ead\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3", "Zigbee\u6280\u8853\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

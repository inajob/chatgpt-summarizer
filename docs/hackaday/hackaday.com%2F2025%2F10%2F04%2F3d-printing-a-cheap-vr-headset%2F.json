Since then, nobodys been able to come up with a killer app to convince even a mild fraction of consumers to engage with the technology. Still, if youre keen to tinker, you might like to make your own headset like [CNCDan] has done.\nThe build is based almost entirely on 3D-printed components and parts sourced from AliExpress. It offers 2880x1440p resolution, thanks to a pair of square 14401440 LCD displays, one for each eye, paired with a couple of 34 mm lenses. The headset has adjustable interpupiliary distance so you can dial the view in to properly suit your eyes. The 3D-printed housing is designed to be compatible with headrest pads from the HTC Vive Pro for comforts sake. Head tracking is also available, with the inclusion of an IMU and an Arduino onboard. [CNCDan] apparently put the build together for under $150, which is not bad compared to the price of a commercial off-the-shelf unit. Files are on Github for the curious.\n[CNCDan] reports good results with the DIY headset, using it primarily with his racing simulator setup. He has had some issues, however, with his LCD screens, which dont properly run at a 90 Hz refresh rate at full resolution, which is frustrating. Its an issue hes still looking into. Weve seen some other neat VR builds over the years, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n"}

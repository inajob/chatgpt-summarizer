In fact, there is so much power at your command now that you can run, say, a DOS emulator on a Windows virtual machine under Linux, even though the resulting DOS prompt would probably still perform better than an old 4.77 MHz PC. Remember when you could get calculators that ran BASIC? Well, [Calculator Clique] shows off BASIC running on a decidedly modern HP Prime calculator. The trick? Its running under Python. Check it out in the video below.\nThink about it. The HP Prime has an ARM processor inside. In addition to its normal programming system, it has Micropython as an option. So thats one interpreter. Then PyBasic has a nice classic Basic interpreter that runs on Python. Weve even ported it to one or two of the Hackaday Superconference badges.\n\nIf you have a Prime, this is a great way to make it even easier to belt out a simple algorithm. Of course, depending on your age, you might prefer to stick with Python. Fair enough, but dont forget the many classic games available for Basic. Adventure and Hunt the Wumpus are two of the sample programs included.\n"}

Weve seen a few projects as a result, emulating the Apple Macs of the 68000 era, but even with the best 3D printing, they can disappoint when it comes to the case. So when [This Does Not Compute] saw a novelty alarm clock using a very well-modelled mini replica of an early Mac, putting a Mac emulator in it was the obvious way to go.\nThe project uses a Raspberry Pi with a small colour LCD.\u00a0 The video below the break takes us through the process of gutting it and mounting the Pi and display on a custom 3D-printed bracket. In an unexpected touch, parts of the original LCD are used to give the curved corners, which owners of an original Mac will remember. It may have a little further to go in that its fake floppy drive is begging to be converted to an SD card slot, and it has a now-unused brightness dial. But wed say its one of the best little Mac emulators weve seen so far, if perhaps not the smallest.\n\n", "title": "- 2026\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u624b\u9803\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fMac\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "2026\u5e74\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9PC\u306790\u5e74\u4ee3\u6a5f\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3002\u521d\u671fMac\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u6642\u8a08\u306bRaspberry Pi\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u3001\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- 2026\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u624b\u9803\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fMac\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u521d\u671fMac\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30e9\u30fc\u30e0\u6642\u8a08", "- Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e03D\u5370\u5237\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306aMac\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u305f\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u63db\u4e88\u5b9a\u306eMac\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

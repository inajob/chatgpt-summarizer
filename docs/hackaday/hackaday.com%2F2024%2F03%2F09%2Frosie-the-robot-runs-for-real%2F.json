[Robert Zollna] must agree since he built a reimagined Rosie and it even caught the notice of mainstream outlet People magazine.\nWe didnt find much information outside of the TikTok video (see below; you can use the Guest button if you dont have an account). However, there were a few clever ideas here. First, the robot mechanism is actually Rosies vacuum cleaner. Like a tail wagging a dog, an off-the-shelf floor vac tows the robot body.\nRosie herself is clearly an office chair base with an artistic body. The head rotates, and the mouth appears to open and close, so theres apparently a little more electronics inside, but thats nothing you couldnt throw together with some RC servos and an ESP32.\nSome videos cover the build so you might be able to glean more details, but the bite-sized videos arent very descriptive even though they are fun to watch. If you thought folks documenting their projects on YouTube was bad, youre really gonna love the TikTok generation.\nWe like the look of Rosie, but as a practical matter, we need our robot vac to be smaller, not larger. However, using these off-the-shelf robots as a quick start for a robotics project is reasonable. Especially if you can pick up one cheap. Not that thats a new idea. They even make stripped-down units with the intent that you dont want to use them as cleaners.\n\n\n @ziggy_nonskid \n#eufy #robitina #robot #rosietherobot #3dprinting #engineering #fyp #cute #robotics #robitina #realrosietherobot \n \u266c original sound  ziggy_nonskid \n\n "}

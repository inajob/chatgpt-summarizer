This wireless connection is implemented using an infrared transceiver, somewhat like IrDA, but as [Zach Resmer] discovered while reverse-engineering this connection, its actually what is called Nearly NEC by [Natalie Silvanovich], who has a GitHub repository full of related Tamagotchi hacking tools and ROM dumps.\nWith the protocol figured out, creating a transceiver for low-bitrate infrared communication isnt particularly hard. In this case, it was implemented using an RP2040 MCU and an appropriate IR LED and receiver pair. This Tamagometer project was also implemented as an app for the Flipper Zero, and a custom PCB called the Pico TamaBadge by [Daniel Weidman].\nTheres a web application associated with [Zach]s project using a Web Serial-enabled browser (i.e. Chrome). The serial protocol is somewhat documented in the patent for the devices connection feature, which makes it relatively easy to implement yourself."}

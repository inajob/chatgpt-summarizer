Font, on the other hand, is a specific implementation of a typeface, for example, Times New Roman Italic 12 pt.\nQ is a counterpoint to the idea that typography is just one fussy detail after another.\nRight about this point, some of you are nodding along and perhaps thinking oh, thats interesting, while the rest of you are already hovering over your browsers Back button. If youre one of the former, you may be interested in checking out the (sort of) interactive tour of typography design elements by the Ohno Type School, a small group that loves design.\nOn one hand, letters are simple and readily recognizable symbols. But at the same time, their simplicity puts a lot of weight on seemingly minor elements. Small changes can have a big visual impact. The tour lays bare answers to questions such as: What is the optimal parting of the cheeks of a capital B? At what height should the crossbar on an A sit, and why does it look so weird if done incorrectly? And yet, the tail of a Q can be just about anything? How and why does an H define the spacing of the entire typeface? All these (and more) are laid bare.\n\nFont design in the hardware world is often constrained by display or memory limitations, but artistry in typography is still something that weve seen expressed in many different and wonderful ways over the years. For example, we covered a typeface whose symbols are not letters, but scope traces. And one enterprising fellow generated a new font (Aver\u00eda) based on the average of every other font installed on his computer. The result was surprisingly attractive.", "title": "\u30bf\u30a4\u30dd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u306e\u57fa\u672c\uff1a\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9055\u3044", "body": "\u66f8\u4f53\u306f\u6587\u5b57\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u305d\u306e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u88c5\u3002\u7d30\u304b\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u8996\u899a\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bf\u30a4\u30dd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u306e\u57fa\u672c\uff1a\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9055\u3044", "\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u5909\u5316\u304c\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u30bf\u30a4\u30dd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff1aOhno Type School\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u82b8\u8853\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u306e\u4e2d\u3067", "\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1aAver\u00eda\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u79d8\u8a71"]}

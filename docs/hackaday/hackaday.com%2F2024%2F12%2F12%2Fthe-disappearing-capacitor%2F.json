The components, like all diodes, have some capacitance at the junction, and this can limit performance. Thats why [lcamtuf] turned to bootstrapping to make that parasitic capacitance almost disappear.\nThe technique appears in several Analog Devices datasheets that presents a mystery. An op amp circuit that would normally limit changes to about 52 kHz has an unusually-placed JFET and claims to boost the bandwidth to 350 kHz.\n\nThe JFET turns out to be in a voltage-follower configuration. The photodiode sees approximately the same voltage on both terminals, so the internal capacitor cant charge and, therefore, doesnt impose any limits on rate of change.\nOf course, a better way to think of it is that tiny changes cause an immediate response to counteract them, and so the capacitors charging and discharging are kept to a minimum.\nIt really isnt important that the capacitor is not charged, but rather that the capacitor doesnt increase or decrease charge. This leads to a second design, which imposes a DC bias voltage on the diode but prevents any signal from causing the capacitor to change from its precharged value.\nPhotodiodes seem exotic, but honestly, all semiconductor diodes are photodiodes if you let the light get to them. It seems that capacitors and op amps are always at loggerheads."}

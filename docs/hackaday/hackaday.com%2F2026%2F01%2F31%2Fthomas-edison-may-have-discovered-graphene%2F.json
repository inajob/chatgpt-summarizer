However, he also occasionally invented things he didnt understand, so they had to be reinvented again later. The latest example comes from researchers at Rice University. While building a replica light bulb, they found that Thomas Edison may have accidentally created graphene while testing the original article.\nToday, we know that applying a voltage to a carbon-based resistor and heating it up to over 2,000 \u00b0C can create turbostratic graphene. Edison used a carbon-based filament and could heat it to over 2,000 \u00b0C.\nThis reminds us of how, in the 1880s, Edison observed current flowing in one direction through a test light bulb that included a plate. However, he thought it was just a curiosity. It would be up to Fleming, in 1904, to figure it out and understand what could be done with it.\nNaturally, Edison wouldnt have known to look for graphene, how to look for it, or what to do with it if he found it. But it does boggle the mind to think about graphene appearing many decades earlier. Or maybe it would still be looking for a killer use. Certainly, as the Rice researchers note, this is one of the easier ways to make graphene."}

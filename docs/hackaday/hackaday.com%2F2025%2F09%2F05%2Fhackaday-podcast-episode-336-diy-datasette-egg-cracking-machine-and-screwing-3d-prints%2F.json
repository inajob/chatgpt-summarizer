The deluge outside didnt stop the hacks coming though, and weve got a healthy smorgasbord for you to snack from. Theres the cutest ever data cassette recorder taking a tiny Olympus dictation machine and re-engineering it with a beautiful case for the Commodore 64, a vastly overcomplex machine for perfectly cracking an egg, the best lightning talk timer Hackaday has ever seen, and a demoscene challenge that eschews a CPU. Then in Quick Hacks weve got a QWERTY slider phone, and a self-rowing canoe that comes straight out of Disneys The Sorcerers Apprentice sequence.\nFor a long time weve had a Field guide series covering tech in infrastructure and other public plain sight, and this weeks one dealt with pivot irrigation. A new subject for Jenny who grew up on a farm in a wet country. Then both editors are for once in agreement, over using self-tapping screws to assemble 3D-printed structures.

Rather than integrating mouse controls into a keyboard, they decided to really lean in and create a chording keyboard  one that creates characters with combinations of key presses, like playing chords on a piano.\nThis project was inspired in part by the Infogrip BAT, which has graced these pages before. Much like the BAT, this uses a total of seven Cherry MX switches: one for each finger, and three for the thumb. In order to get the placement just right for you, [akmnos22] suggests laying your hand in a comfortable position on a piece of paper and marking where your fingers naturally rest, then importing these markings into CAD software to decide where the key switch holes should be.\nThe brains of this operation is a Raspberry Pi Pico, which provides more than enough GPIO pins to do the job. [akmnos22] does a nice job of explaining exactly how to put one of these together, from the design concept through the programming process and how to actually chord on the thing.\nWould you rather chord with two hands? It might be even faster.", "title": "\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u306b\u75b2\u308c\u3001\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3067\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u914d\u7f6e\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806\u3082\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Cherry MX\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806", "\u624b\u306e\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u30ad\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u914d\u7f6e\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4e21\u624b\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u304c\u3055\u3089\u306b\u901f\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044"]}

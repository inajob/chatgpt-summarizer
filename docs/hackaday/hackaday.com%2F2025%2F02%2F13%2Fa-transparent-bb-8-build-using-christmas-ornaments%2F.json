R2-D2 is a popular choice, but you can even build yourself a neat little BB-8 if youre so inclined. [Piyush] has built a particularly compelling example thats transparent, which lets you see the internals and how it all works.\nThe build makes creative use of a pair of Christmas ornaments. They are perhaps the cheapest and easiest way to source a clear plastic sphere. One serves as the head, while the other serves as the larger spherical body. Inside, an Arduino Pro Micro is running the show. Its hooked up to a L293D motor driver which runs the drive motors and the reaction wheel motor which provides stability, while a separate MOSFET is on hand to run the gear motor which controls the head.\nTheres also an HC-05 module for Bluetooth communication, and a BNO055 sensor for motion tracking and ensuring the robot stays the right way up. 3D printed components are used prodigiously to cram everything together tightly enough to fit. Theres even a printed charging base to juice up the little droid. Controlling the robot is as simple as using a smartphone with an app created in the MIT App Inventor.\nIf youve never built a spherical rolling robot before\u2014and few of us have\u2014this design is a great reference for your own work. Weve seen a few BB-8s over the years, most of which dropped shortly after the movie was released. \n"}

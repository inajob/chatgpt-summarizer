R2-D2 is a popular choice, but you can even build yourself a neat little BB-8 if youre so inclined. [Piyush] has built a particularly compelling example thats transparent, which lets you see the internals and how it all works.\nThe build makes creative use of a pair of Christmas ornaments. They are perhaps the cheapest and easiest way to source a clear plastic sphere. One serves as the head, while the other serves as the larger spherical body. Inside, an Arduino Pro Micro is running the show. Its hooked up to a L293D motor driver which runs the drive motors and the reaction wheel motor which provides stability, while a separate MOSFET is on hand to run the gear motor which controls the head.\nTheres also an HC-05 module for Bluetooth communication, and a BNO055 sensor for motion tracking and ensuring the robot stays the right way up. 3D printed components are used prodigiously to cram everything together tightly enough to fit. Theres even a printed charging base to juice up the little droid. Controlling the robot is as simple as using a smartphone with an app created in the MIT App Inventor.\nIf youve never built a spherical rolling robot before\u2014and few of us have\u2014this design is a great reference for your own work. Weve seen a few BB-8s over the years, most of which dropped shortly after the movie was released. \n", "title": "- \u300c\u81ea\u4f5cBB-8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u900f\u660e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u898b\u305b\u308b\u300d", "body": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u306eBB-8\u3092\u900f\u660e\u306a\u5f62\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u4f8b\u3002 Arduino\u3084\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u81ea\u4f5cBB-8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u900f\u660e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u898b\u305b\u308b\u300d", "- \u300c\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "- \u300cArduino Pro Micro\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u7acb\u5f0f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "- \u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308bBluetooth\u642d\u8f09\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7403\u72b6\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u53c2\u8003\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u300d"]}

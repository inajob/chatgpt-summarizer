Really cold. His recent two-part video shows a propane vapor compression system that can go down to -37\u00b0 C as well as a two-stage system using homemade ethylene that can get to -83\u00b0 C. Hes trying to get to -100\u00b0, so hes close, and we have no doubt hell get there.\nThe video explains that using two different refrigerants makes the design more practical. At the low temperatures involved, you have to deal with compressor oil freezing. There is a lot of theory required to design an efficient cooler and a lot of know-how required to make gas-tight connections with all the different materials involved.\nUsing propane in both stages did provide a little additional cooling. But using ethylene in the second stage didnt work as expected. There were two issues to work through. Part of it was the average temperature of the system, and also, the homemade ethylene needed purification. The ethylene purification setup was almost as complex as the main system and also reminded us, for some reason, of the movie Darkstar. It didnt work as well as he wanted, which means we have to wait for part two to see it all actually working.\nWeve seen this same guy make dry ice. Hes also tried to make liquid nitrogen, too.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c-100\u2103\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u300dDIY\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u8a18\u9332", "body": "Hyperspace Pirate creates super cold temperatures with propane and homemade ethylene in a refrigeration system.

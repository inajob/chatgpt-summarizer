Its easy enough to load one on your modern computer, but there are plenty of hardware options, too. The computer wed have done anything for back in 1983 seems to be a phrase many of them bring to mind, but its so appropriate because they keep getting better. Take [Stormbytes1970]s Pi Pico-powered Sinclair ZX Spectrum mini laptop (Spanish language, Google Translate link), for example. Its a slightly chunky netbook thats a ZX Spectrum, and it has a far better keyboard than the original.\nOn the PCB is the Pico, the power supply circuitry, an SD card, and a speaker. But its when the board is flipped over that the interesting stuff starts. In place of the squidgy rubber keyboard of yore, it has a proper keyboard,. Were not entirely sure which switch it uses, but it appears to be a decent one, nevertheless. The enclosure is a slick 3D-printed sub-netbook for retro gaming on the go. Sadly, it wont edit Hackaday, so we wont be slipping one in the pack next time we go on the road, but we like it a lot.\n\nIts not the first Spectrum laptop weve covered, but we think it has upped the ante over the last one. If you just want the Spectrums BASIC language experience, you can try a modern version that runs natively on your PC.", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3067\u3001ZX Spectrum\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- Pi Pico\u642d\u8f09\u306eZX Spectrum\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u30b5\u30d6\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30c3\u30af", "- ZX Spectrum\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0BASIC\u3092PC\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

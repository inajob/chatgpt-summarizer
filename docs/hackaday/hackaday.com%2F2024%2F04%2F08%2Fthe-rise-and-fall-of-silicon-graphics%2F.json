(later SGI) burst onto the market in 1981 with what was effectively one of the first commercial graphics operations accelerator with the Geometry Engine. SGIs founder  James Henry Clark was quite possibly as colorful a character as the companys products, with [Bradford Morgan White] covering the years leading up to SGIs founding, its highlights and its eventual demise in 2009.\nThe story of SGI is typical of a start-up that sees itself become the market leader for years, even as this market gradually changes. For SGI it was the surge in commodity 3D graphics cards in the 1990s alongside affordable (and cluster-capable; insert Beowulf cluster jokes here) server hardware that posed a major problem. Eventually itd start offering Windows NT workstations, drop its MIPS-based systems in a shift to Intels disastrous Itanium range of CPUs and fall to the last-ditch effort of any struggling company: a logo change.\nNone of this was effective, naturally, and ultimately SGI would file (again) for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, with Rackable Systems snapping up its assets and renaming itself to SGI, before getting bought out by HPE and sunsetting SGI as a brand name."}

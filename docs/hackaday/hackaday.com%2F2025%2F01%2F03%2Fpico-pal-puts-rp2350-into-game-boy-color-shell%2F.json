For many, the appeal is nostalgic. Others are attracted to the lo-fi graphical and sound design of these games, necessitated by the limited hardware of the time.\nThat said nobody would claim those old systems were perfect. Which is why a hybrid approach like [Peter Khouly] has been working on with the Pico Pal might be the ultimate solution. This replacement motherboard for the Game Boy Color (GBC) is powered by the RP2350, meaning the external hardware will have the same look and feel as it did back in 1998, but youll still be able to reap the benefits of modern emulation.\nWhile the origins of the project go a bit farther, [Peter] has been working on this particular variation of the Pico Pal GBC since August, and has kept a fascinating log of his progress. Just getting the RP2350 to emulate Pok\u00e9mon isnt really that big of a deal, but getting all the ancillary hardware implemented and fitted inside the case of the GBC is a different story. Especially since [Peter] intends to pack plenty of features into the final product, such as rechargable batteries, Bluetooth audio, real-time clock support, and digital video out.\nThe most recent status update is from just last week, where [Peter] goes over some of the new features hes been working on. A major one is the soft power solution, where the physical power switch doesnt just pull the plug like it did back in the 1990s. Instead, the switch triggers the board to save the game and enter into a low-power mode so that it can come right back on to where you left off. This does impact battery life, but so far, it looks like the Pico Pal GBC will be able to run for at least five hours on a charge, and more than twice that if you dont mind turning off the audio.\nIt sounds like theres still several gremlins to track down in the design, but even in its current state, the Pico Pal GBC looks very interesting. Were immediately reminded of the phenomenal work [Bucket Mouse] has put in on a similar refit for the original DMG-1 Game Boy.", "title": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u30fb90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u304c\u8607\u308b\uff01Pico Pal GBC\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "80\u300190\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306f\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u547c\u3073\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u300cPico Pal GBC\u300d\u306f\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u9032\u5316\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["80\u5e74\u4ee3\u30fb90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u304c\u8607\u308b\uff01Pico Pal GBC\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u57fa\u677f\u300cPico Pal GBC\u300d", "Game Boy Color\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01RP2350\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\uff1aPico Pal GBC\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u6614\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\uff01Pico Pal\u306e\u9769\u547d\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

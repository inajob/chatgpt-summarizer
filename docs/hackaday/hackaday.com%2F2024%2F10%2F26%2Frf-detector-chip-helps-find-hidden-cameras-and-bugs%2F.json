The bug of course always had a flashing LED to make it really obvious to viewers, and the scanner was made by the props department to look all cool and futuristic.\nIts not so far-fetched though, while bugs and hidden cameras in for example an Airbnb may not have flashing LEDs, they still emit RF and can be detected with a signal strength meter. Thats the premise behind [RamboRogers] RF hunter, the spy movie electronic scanner made real.\nAt the rear of the device is an ESP32, but the front end is an AD8317 RF detector chip. This is an interesting and useful component, in that it contains a logarithmic amplifier such that it produces a voltage proportional to the RF input in decibels. Youll find it at the heart of an RF power meter, but its also perfect for a precision field strength meter like this one. That movie spy would have a much higher chance of finding the bug with one of these.\nFor the real spies of course, the instruments are much more sophisticated."}

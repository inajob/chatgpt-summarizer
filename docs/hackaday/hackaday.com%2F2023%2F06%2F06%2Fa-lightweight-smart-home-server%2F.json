The same sort of feature creep sneaks into some of the more popular self-hosted home server platforms as well, with things like openHAB requiring so much computing power that they barely function on something like a Raspberry Pi. [Paulo] thought there should be a more lightweight way of tackling a project like this, and set about building his own smart home server with help from some interesting software.\nThe project is based around the Dirigera hub from Ikea, partially because [Paulo] is planning to use other smart home devices from Ikea as he can easily find them where he is, and also because these devices tend to use Zigbee, a non-proprietary communications standard. This means that if he ever wants to swap out the hub for another one in the future, it wont be difficult to do. From here the major hurdle is that using the default software from these devices is fairly limiting, so [Paulo] reached for a Raspbee 2 Zigbee gateway for use with a Raspberry Pi and an extremely lightweight and customizable web server called Mako to make this happen. Using Lua as the high-level language to tie everything together he was able to easily deploy the server to control the Ikea hub and devices and automate them in any way he sees fit.\nWhile it is true that software like openHAB and others already exists to do virtually any home automation task that could be imagined, if youre looking to do something with a bare minimum of computing power something like [Paulo]s solution is likely going to be the fastest and most reliable method of getting a few things automated around the home. If youre looking for something completely open source and built from the ground up, though, we have seen a few alternative smart home solutions like this one which dont rely on any proprietary hardware or software, but do take a little bit more effort on the users part."}

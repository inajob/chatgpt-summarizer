Unfortunately, the observatory is in LEO, at an altitude of around 370 km. The natural orbital decay combined with increased solar activity now threatens to end Swifts mission, unless NASA can find someone who can boost its orbit.\nUsing Swift as a testbed for commercial orbit-boosting technologies, NASA is working with a number of companies to investigate options. One of these is the SSPICY demonstration of in-orbit inspection technology by Starfish Space thats part of an existing Phase III program.\nAlthough currently no option has been selected and Swift is still at risk of re-entering Earths atmosphere within the near future, there seems to be at least a glimmer of hope that this process can be reverted, and a perfectly fine triple-telescope space observatory can keep doing science for many years to come. Along the way it may also provide a blueprint for how to do the same with other LEO assets that are at risk of meeting a fiery demise.", "title": "\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u306e\u904b\u547d\uff1a\u8ecc\u9053\u7dad\u6301\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u5b87\u5b99\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u8ecc\u9053\u4f4e\u4e0b\u304c\u61f8\u5ff5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001NASA\u306f\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u306e\u904b\u547d\uff1a\u8ecc\u9053\u7dad\u6301\u306e\u6311\u6226", "NASA\u3001\u5546\u696d\u6280\u8853\u3067\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u6551\u3048\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\uff1a\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u89b3\u6e2c\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u8ecc\u9053\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f", "\u5730\u7403\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u5371\u6a5f\uff1a\u30b9\u30a6\u30a3\u30d5\u30c8\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

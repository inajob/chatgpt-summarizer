But the original Apple I was a simple PC board and required a little effort to start up a working system. [Artem] has an Apple I reproduction PCB, and decided to build it on camera so we could watch.\nFor the Apple I, the user supplied a keyboard and some transformers, so [Artem] had to search for suitable components. He wisely checks the PCB to make sure there are no shorts in the traces. From there, you can watch him build the machine, but be warned: even with speed ups and editing, the video is over an hour long.\nIf you want to jump to the mostly working device, try around the 57-minute mark. The machine has a basic ROM monitor and, of course, needs a monitor. There was a small problem with memory, but he eventually worked it out by inhibiting some extra RAM on the board. Troubleshooting is half of the battle getting something like this.\nWant to look inside the clock generator chip? Or skip the PCB and just use an FPGA.\n\n", "title": "- Apple I\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248PCB\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "Apple I\u306e\u518d\u73fePC\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u63a2\u3057\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- Apple I\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248PCB\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u4f5cApple I\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u8ffd\u3046", "- \u90e8\u54c1\u8abf\u9054\u304b\u3089\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u307e\u3067\uff1aApple I\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u8a18", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eApple I\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6539\u9020\u3068\u5de5\u592b", "- FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fApple I\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6848\u3068\u305d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

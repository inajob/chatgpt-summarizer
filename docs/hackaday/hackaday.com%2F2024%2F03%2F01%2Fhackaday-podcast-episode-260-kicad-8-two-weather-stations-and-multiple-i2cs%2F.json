Theres big news in the KiCad community, and we talked about all the new features along with some old woes. Great minds think alike, apparently, since two different e-ink weather stations made the cut this week, as did a floating oscilloscope, an automated film-developing tank, and some DIY solar panels.\nWe talked about a hacker who figured out that water makes a pretty good solar storage medium, and its cheaper than lithium, another who knows that a crappy lathe is better than no lathe, and what every hacker should know about Ethernet. Is there a future for room-temperature superconductors? Maybe it just depends on how cold the room is.\n\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\n\nEpisode 260 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nFLOSS Weekly Episode 772: Raspberry Pi From The Man Himself\nAn Automotive Locksmith On The Flipper Zero And Car Theft\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Beeman] for identifying the Shephard-Risset tone.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nKiCad 8 Makes Your Life Better Without Caveats\nA Smarter Solar Water Heater\n\nOur Home Automation Contest Starts Now!\n\n\nESP32 Weather Station Looks Great With Color E-Paper Display\n\nHumidity Sensor Shootout\nBuilding Touch Sensors From Digital Barometer Chips\n\n\nThere\u2019s Hope For That Cheap Lathe Yet!\nWireless Telescope Guidance You Can Build On The Cheap\n3D-Printed Automated Development Tank For Classic Photo Films\n\nDarkroom Robot Automates Away The Tedium Of Film Developing\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nThe Photodiode You Never Knew You Had\nAvoid I2C Address Conflicts On ESP32 By Pin Muxing\nBlast From The Past: Schematic Templates\n\n\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nSolar E-Ink Weather Station Works On Dark Days, Too\nYour Scope, Armed And Ready\nMaking A Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Is Almost DIY-able\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nAsk Hackaday: What If You Did Have A Room Temperature Superconductor?\nEthernet For Hackers: Equipment Exploration\n\nEthernet For Hackers: The Very Basics\nThe Modular Connector And How It Got That Way\n\n\n"}

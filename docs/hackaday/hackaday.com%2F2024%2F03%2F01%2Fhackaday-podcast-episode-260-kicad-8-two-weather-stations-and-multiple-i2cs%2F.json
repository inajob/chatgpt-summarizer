Theres big news in the KiCad community, and we talked about all the new features along with some old woes. Great minds think alike, apparently, since two different e-ink weather stations made the cut this week, as did a floating oscilloscope, an automated film-developing tank, and some DIY solar panels.\nWe talked about a hacker who figured out that water makes a pretty good solar storage medium, and its cheaper than lithium, another who knows that a crappy lathe is better than no lathe, and what every hacker should know about Ethernet. Is there a future for room-temperature superconductors? Maybe it just depends on how cold the room is.\n\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\n\nEpisode 260 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nFLOSS Weekly Episode 772: Raspberry Pi From The Man Himself\nAn Automotive Locksmith On The Flipper Zero And Car Theft\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Beeman] for identifying the Shephard-Risset tone.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nKiCad 8 Makes Your Life Better Without Caveats\nA Smarter Solar Water Heater\n\nOur Home Automation Contest Starts Now!\n\n\nESP32 Weather Station Looks Great With Color E-Paper Display\n\nHumidity Sensor Shootout\nBuilding Touch Sensors From Digital Barometer Chips\n\n\nThere\u2019s Hope For That Cheap Lathe Yet!\nWireless Telescope Guidance You Can Build On The Cheap\n3D-Printed Automated Development Tank For Classic Photo Films\n\nDarkroom Robot Automates Away The Tedium Of Film Developing\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nThe Photodiode You Never Knew You Had\nAvoid I2C Address Conflicts On ESP32 By Pin Muxing\nBlast From The Past: Schematic Templates\n\n\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nSolar E-Ink Weather Station Works On Dark Days, Too\nYour Scope, Armed And Ready\nMaking A Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Is Almost DIY-able\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nAsk Hackaday: What If You Did Have A Room Temperature Superconductor?\nEthernet For Hackers: Equipment Exploration\n\nEthernet For Hackers: The Very Basics\nThe Modular Connector And How It Got That Way\n\n\n", "title": "\u9031\u9593\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "body": "\u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30c0\u30f3\u306f2\u670829\u65e5\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u904e\u53bb1\u9031\u9593\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3057\u305f\u3002KiCad\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u65e7\u554f\u984c\u3092\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3063\u305f\u3002e-ink\u6c17\u8c61\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3084\u6d6e\u904a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306a\u3069\u3001\u4eca\u9031\u306e\u6ce8\u76ee\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u54c1\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3084Ethernet\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a18\u4e8b\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u9031\u9593\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "KiCad\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u65e7\u614b", "e-ink\u5929\u6c17\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u6d6e\u904a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u6c34\u7d20\u84c4\u96fb", "\u90e8\u5c4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d85\u4f1d\u5c0e\u4f53\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u671f\u5f85"]}

Its a mistake youll usually only make once or twice. But where most of us would look back at such mishaps as cautionary experiences, [Styropyro] sees an opportunity.\nArmed with 100 car batteries wired in parallel, his recent video sees him pitting an assortment of household objects against the combined might of eighty-five thousand amps. Threaded rods, bolts, and angle iron all produce the sort of lightshow youd expect, but [Styropyro] quickly discovered that holding larger objects down was more difficult than anticipated. It turns out that the magnetic fields being generated by the incredible amount of current rushing through the system was pulling the terminals apart and breaking the connection. After reinforcing the business end of his rig, he was able to tackle stouter objects such as crowbars and wrenches with explosive results.\nA modified log splitter serves as a remotely operated switch.\nWe found that his remotely operated switch, built out of a hydraulic log splitter, to be a particular highlight of the video  unfortunately he only briefly goes over its construction at the very start. His side experiment, fashioning an sort of manually-operated carbon arc lamp with a pair of thick graphite electrodes and demonstrating is luminous efficacy compared to modern LEDs was an unexpected treat. As was the off-the-shelf domestic circuit breaker that impressed [Styropyro] by refusing to yield even after repeated jolts.\nWhile the showers of sparks and vaporized metal might trigger some sweaty palms among the audience, weve seen [Styropyro] handle far scarier contraptions in the past. Though he may come off as devil-may-care in his videos, we figure theres no way he could have made it this long without blinding or maiming himself if he didnt know what he was doing.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u885d\u6483\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\uff0185,000\u30a2\u30f3\u30da\u30a2\u306b\u8010\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u300d", "body": "100\u53f0\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4e26\u5217\u306b\u914d\u7dda\u3057\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u7269\u4f53\u3092\u5408\u8a088.5\u4e07\u30a2\u30f3\u30da\u30a2\u3067\u5b9f\u9a13\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u78c1\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308a\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u305f\u5f8c\u306f\u6210\u529f\u3002\u6728\u306e\u5207\u65ad\u6a5f\u3092\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3084\u70ad\u7d20\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6280\u8853\u306b\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u885d\u6483\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\uff0185,000\u30a2\u30f3\u30da\u30a2\u306b\u8010\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\uff01\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30ed\u30b0\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8f1d\u5ea6\uff01\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3068LED\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u5b9f\u9a13\u300d", "\u300c\u610f\u5916\u306a\u5f37\u3055\uff01\u7834\u640d\u3057\u306a\u3044\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u300d", "\u300c\u8003\u3048\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30df\u30b9\uff01\u70b8\u88c2\u3059\u308b\u706b\u82b1\u3068\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u300d"]}

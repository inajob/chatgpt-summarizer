If you said a Jupiter ACE, you get a gold star. These are rare because ordinary people in 1982 didnt want Forth, so only about 5,000 of the devices were sold. [Cees Meijer] assumes they are unaffordable, so he built a replica and shows you how you can, too. [Scott Baker] built one recently; you can see his video below.\nThe resemblance to the Sinclair computer wasnt just a coincidence. Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers were behind the computer, and both had worked for Sinclair previously. In addition to being famous for using Forth, the machine initially had a badly manufactured case and an unreliable keyboard. A later version tried to correct these issues, but there were fewer than 1,000 made. [Cees] replica used a design from [Grant Searle] with some modifications.\nWe liked the realistic look of the 3D printed keyboard. The keyboard uses white plastic with raised letters. A quick black spray paint followed by sanding gives the appearance of black keys with white printed text.\nOverall, this is a good-looking build of a computer you probably wont see in person. We wish Forth had caught on in the early PC world, but it didnt. [Grant] was prolific with replica computers, and [Cees] isnt the only one who used that work as a starting point for their own projects. If you want real old-school Forth, you have to go back a few more years.\n\n", "title": "1982\u5e74\u306e\u5e0c\u5c11\u306aJupiter ACE\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b8\u30e5\u30d4\u30bf\u30fcACE\u306fForth\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5e0c\u5c11\u3067\u7d045,000\u53f0\u3057\u304b\u58f2\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["1982\u5e74\u306e\u5e0c\u5c11\u306aJupiter ACE\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Sinclair ZX81\u3068\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001Forth\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u793e\u306e\u5143\u5f93\u696d\u54e1\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305fJupiter ACE\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306aJupiter ACE\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff011982\u5e74\u306eJupiter ACE\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

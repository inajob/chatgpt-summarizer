If you said a Jupiter ACE, you get a gold star. These are rare because ordinary people in 1982 didnt want Forth, so only about 5,000 of the devices were sold. [Cees Meijer] assumes they are unaffordable, so he built a replica and shows you how you can, too. [Scott Baker] built one recently; you can see his video below.\nThe resemblance to the Sinclair computer wasnt just a coincidence. Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers were behind the computer, and both had worked for Sinclair previously. In addition to being famous for using Forth, the machine initially had a badly manufactured case and an unreliable keyboard. A later version tried to correct these issues, but there were fewer than 1,000 made. [Cees] replica used a design from [Grant Searle] with some modifications.\nWe liked the realistic look of the 3D printed keyboard. The keyboard uses white plastic with raised letters. A quick black spray paint followed by sanding gives the appearance of black keys with white printed text.\nOverall, this is a good-looking build of a computer you probably wont see in person. We wish Forth had caught on in the early PC world, but it didnt. [Grant] was prolific with replica computers, and [Cees] isnt the only one who used that work as a starting point for their own projects. If you want real old-school Forth, you have to go back a few more years.\n\n"}

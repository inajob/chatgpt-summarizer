Naturally, this has to be used for good, and that is why we have the Doom PDF project, as well as [Game of Tobi] using that project as the inspiration for a Super Mario 64 port based on the decompiled source code.\nThe nice thing about the Super Mario 64 version is that its stand-alone, running from a 23.5 MB PDF, unlike the Doom PDF which runs the game in DOSBox. The compromise is that Super Mario 64 PDF runs at just a few FPS, with the output in glorious ASCII.\nWhat enables this feat is to open the PDF in a viewer that supports JavaScript, with the PDF.js that comes with most browsers generally allowing for integrated JS in the PDF to be executed. Unfortunately [Game of Tobi] hasnt released source code for this project, but we hope that this is forthcoming.\nWhile one can argue about the practicality of this whole demonstration from a gaming perspective, it definitely shows that PDF as a format has gotten way out of hand now that its even overrun with hellspawn and Italian plumbers.\n\n", "title": "- PDF\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b: Super Mario 64\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "body": "PDF\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u4f8b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- PDF\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b: Super Mario 64\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "- Doom PDF\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- JavaScript\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fPDF\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- Super Mario 64\u304c23.5MB\u306ePDF\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u6642\u4ee3", "- PDF\u5f62\u5f0f\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u305d\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u5fdc\u7528\u4f8b"]}

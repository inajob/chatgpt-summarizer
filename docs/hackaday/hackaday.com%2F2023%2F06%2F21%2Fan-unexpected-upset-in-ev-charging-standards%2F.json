Its finally taking off with a number of manufacturers signing on.\nCompanies launching standards based on their previously proprietary technology in opposition to an established alternative usually leads to standards proliferation. However, with recent announcements from Ford, GM, and Rivian that they would begin supporting NACS in their vehicles, it seems a new dominant standard is supplanting CCS (and the all-but-dead CHAdeMO) in North America.\nAs Tesla already has the most extensive charging network on the continent and has begun opening it up for other EVs, it makes sense that other marques would want to support NACS, if nothing else to satiate customer demand for a dead-simple charging experience. Dongles are annoying enough for plugging in an external monitor. Having to mess with one while handling high-power electrical connections is less than ideal, to say the least.\nIf you want to add NACS to your own EV project, the standard is here. Weve discussed some of the different standards before as well as work toward wirelessly charging EVs (besides the inductive charger on the EV1). It certainly seems like the time to get in on the ground floor of an EV charging empire with an army of Charglas.", "title": "\u300cNACS\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u5317\u7c73\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u7684\u5145\u96fb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066", "body": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306f\u6628\u5e74\u3001\u5145\u96fb\u8a2d\u5099\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3092\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u898f\u683c\u3067\u3042\u308b\u5317\u7c73\u5145\u96fb\u6a19\u6e96(NACS)\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u4ed6\u793e\u304cNACS\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6a19\u6e96\u304c\u5317\u7c73\u3067\u5e83\u304c\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u65e2\u306b\u6700\u3082\u5e83\u7bc4\u56f2\u3067\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u4f01\u696d\u304cNACS\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u7406\u306b\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u81ea\u5206\u3067EV\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3001NACS\u304c\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cNACS\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u5317\u7c73\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u7684\u5145\u96fb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u304cNorth American Charging Standard\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3082\u63a1\u7528", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u5145\u96fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306b\u4ed6\u793e\u3082\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u5bfe\u5fdc\u8eca\u7a2e\u304c\u62e1\u5927", "CCS\u3084CHAdeMO\u3092\u4ee3\u66ff\u3059\u308bNACS\u304c\u3001\u5317\u7c73\u3067\u4e3b\u8981\u306a\u6a19\u6e96\u306b", "EV\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306bNACS\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002EV\u5145\u96fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u306e\u6210\u9577\u3078"]}

Usually this comes from audiophiles with, wed dare to suggest, more money than sense. But oddly theres an arena in which the elusive tone has less of the rubbish about it and it in fact, quite important. [Jim Lill] is a musician, and like all musicians he knows that different combinations of microphones impart a different sound to the recording. But as its such a difficult property to quantify, hes set out to learn all he can about where the tone comes from in a microphone.\nHes coming to this from the viewpoint of a musician rather than an engineer, but his methodology is not diminished by this. Hes putting each mic on test in front of the same speaker at the same position, and playing a standard piece of music and a tone sweep through each. He doesnt have an audio analyser, reference speaker and microphone, or anechoic chamber, so hes come up with a real-world standard instead. Hes comparing every mic he can find with a Shure SM57, the go-to general purpose standard in the world of microphones for as long as anyone can remember, being a 1960s development of their earlier Unidyne series. His reasoning is that while its response is not flat the sound of the SM57 is what most people are used to hearing from a microphone, so it makes sense to measure the others against its performance.\nAlong the way he tests a huge number of microphones including famous and expensive ones from exclusive studios and finally one he made himself by mounting a cartridge atop a soda can. Youll have to watch the video below the break for his conclusions, we can promise its worth it.\n\n\nThanks [Michael Field] for the tip."}

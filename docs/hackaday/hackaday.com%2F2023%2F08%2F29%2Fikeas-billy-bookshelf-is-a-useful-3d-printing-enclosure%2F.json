This is particularly helpful for printing certain materials which are more sensitive to cold drafts or other thermal disruptions to the working area.\u00a0 If you want an elegant solution to the problem, consider getting yourself an IKEA Billy bookshelf, says [wavlew].\nThe Billy makes a remarkably elegant 3D printing workstation, overall. Its got a nifty slide-out drawer that makes a perfect mounting point for a 3D printer. It lets you slide out the printer for maintenance, using the controls, or extracting finished prints. It also naturally features plenty of storage for your filament, tools, and other accoutrements. When it comes to the business of actually printing though, you just slide the printer inside and shut the door. Its thermal and noise isolating performance can also be further improved by adding a silicone door seal.\nWe love this idea. Too often, 3D printers are left chugging away on messy desks, where theyre subject to blasts from AC vents and other disruptions. Having everything tidily tucked away in a cupboard neatens things significantly, and could also prove helpful if you pursue fume extraction, too. \nIf youve identified any other nifty maker applications for IKEA furniture, be sure to let us know!"}

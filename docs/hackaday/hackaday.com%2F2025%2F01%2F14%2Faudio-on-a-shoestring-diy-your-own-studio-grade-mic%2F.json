In the microphone build video below, [Electronoobs] found himself inspired by DIY Perks earlier efforts. He took on the challenge of building a $20 high-quality microphone\u2014a budget-friendly alternative to models priced at $500. The result: an engaging and educational journey that has its moments of triumph, its challenges, and of course, opportunities for improvement.\nThe core of the build lies in the JLI-2555 capsule, identical to those found in premium microphones. The process involves assembling a custom PCB for the amplifier, a selection of high-quality capacitors, and designing lightweight yet shielded wiring to minimize noise. [Electronoobs] also demonstrates the importance of a well-constructed metal mesh enclosure to eliminate interference, borrowing techniques like shaping mesh over a wooden template and insulating wires with ultra-thin enamel copper. While the final build does not quite reach the studio-quality level and looks of the referenced DIY Perks\u2019 build, it is an impressive attempt to watch and learn from.\nThe project\u2019s key challenge here would be achieving consistent audio quality. The microphone struggled with noise, low volume, and single-channel audio, until [Electronoobs] made smart modifications to the shielded wiring and amplification stages. Despite the hurdles, the build stands as an affordable alternative with significant potential for refinement in future iterations.\n\n", "title": "- \u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "body": "$20\u306e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b66\u3073\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3002\u6539\u5584\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "- DIY\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01$20\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u5668\u7528\u306b\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u97f3\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5e72\u6e09\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068\u305d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u578bDIY\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

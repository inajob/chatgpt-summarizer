[iforce2d] has a large number of boards with a lot of headers, and has created a rather special CNC machine to to do the job. Its a soldering robot, controlled by LinuxCNC and you can see it below the break.\nSuperficially it resembles a 3D printer made in aluminium, with an X-Y movable table and a Z-direction represented by a soldering iron and solder feeder on an arm. The solder feeder uses a Bowden tube, with a 3D-printer extruder motor pushing the solder wire down a PTFE tube and finally into a fine aluminium tube from which its fed to the iron tip.\nThough hes done a beautiful job of it, creating the machine is not all thats required, because the tool path requires more attention than simply moving the iron to each pin and supplying some solder. Theres a need to consider the effect of that heat, how much each pad needs, and how much neighbouring pads contribute.\nWeve had repetitive soldering tasks just like this one though not on this scale, so we can understand the tedium this machine will relieve. We cant however help being reminded of XKCD 1319.\n\n"}

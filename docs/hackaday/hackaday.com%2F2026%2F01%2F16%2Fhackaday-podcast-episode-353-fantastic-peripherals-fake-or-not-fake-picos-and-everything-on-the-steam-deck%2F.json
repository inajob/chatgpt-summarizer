In this episode, theyll start off by marveling over the evolution of the smart knob and other open hardware input devices, then discuss a futuristic propulsion technology you can demo in your own kitchen sink, and a cheap handheld game system that gets a new lease on life thanks to the latest version of the ESP32 microcontroller.\nFrom there theyll cover spinning CRTs, creating custom GUIs on Android, and yet another thing you can build of out that old Ender 3 collecting dust in the basement. The episode wraps up with a discussion about putting Valves Steam Deck to work and a look at the history-making medical evacuation of the International Space Station.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nAs always, this episode is available in DRM-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 353 Show Notes:\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThink you know that sound?

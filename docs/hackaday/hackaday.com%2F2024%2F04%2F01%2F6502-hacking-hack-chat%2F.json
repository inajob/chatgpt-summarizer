Weve come a long way since then, and while nobody seriously hopes for a wholesale return to the time when a Commodore 64 or Apple II was the home computing power play, theres still a lot to be said for the seat-of-the-pants feeling of the day. Our engineering forebears had their work cut out for them, and building the home PC revolution from the ground up with microprocessors that by todays standards were laughably limited is something worth celebrating.\nEvery retrocomputing enthusiast has their own favorite chip, and for Anders, its obviously the 6502  enough to give birth to his 65uino project, which put the storied microprocessor at the heart of an Arduino pin-compatible microcontroller. Its a neat project that seems to have caught a lot of peoples imaginations and opened up a world of hardware and software hacks that modern hardware just doesnt need.\nGetting closer to the silicon is the goal of retrocomputing, and Anders is making it easy to get involved. And were lucky enough to have him stop by the Hack Chat to talk all about teaching the 6502 some 21st-century tricks. Stop by and join in the discussion, and maybe youll catch the 8-bit bug too.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, April 3 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter."}

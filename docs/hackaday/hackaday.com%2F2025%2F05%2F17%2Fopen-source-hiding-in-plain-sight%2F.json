[Tom] has been interviewing some of the principals involved, so he\u2019s got some first-hand perspective on it all \u2013 you should really go read his pieces. But the short version is that an old library that many Nintendo game emulators use appears to have cribbed code from both and open-source real-time operating system called RTEMS, and the Linux kernel itself.\nYou probably know Linux, but RTEMS is a high-reliability RTOS for aerospace. People in the field tell me that it\u2019s well-known in those circles, but it doesn\u2019t have a high profile in the hacker world. Still, satellites run RTEMS, so it\u2019s probably also a good place to draw inspiration from, or simply use the library as-is. Since it\u2019s BSD-licensed, you can also borrow entire functions wholesale if you attribute them properly.\nIn the end, an RTOS is an RTOS. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s developed for blinking LEDs or for guiding ICBMs. This thought got [Tom] and I to thinking about what other high-reliability open-source code is out there, hidden away in obscurity because of the industry that it was developed for. NASA\u2019s core flight system came instantly to mind, but NASA makes much of its code available for you to use if you\u2019re interested. There are surely worse places to draw inspiration!\nWhat other off-the-beaten-path software sources do you know of that might be useful for our crowd?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

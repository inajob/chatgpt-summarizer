Back in the 1950s the semiconductor industry was in relative infancy, and at the consumer end electronics were largely synonymous with radio. [Shango066] brings us a transistor radio from that era, a Jewel TR1 from about 1958, that despite its four-transistor simplicity to our eyes would have been a rare and expensive device when new.\nAs youd expect, a transistor radio heading toward its 70th birthday requires a little care to return to its former glory, and while this one is very quiet it does at least work after a fashion. The video below the break is a long one that you might wish to watch at double speed, but it takes us through the now-rare skill of fault-finding and aligning an AM radio receiver. First up are a set of very tired electrolytic capacitors whose replacement restores the volume, and then its clear from the lack of stations that the set has a problem at the RF end. Were treated to the full process of aligning a superhet receiver through the relatively forgiving low-frequency medium of a medium-wave radio. Along the way, he damages one of the IF transformers and has to replace it with a modern equivalent, which we would have concealed under the can from the original.\nThe video may be long, but its worth a look for the vintage parts if not for the quality of radio stations on the air today in California. For many readers, AM broadcast is becoming a thing of the past, so were not sure well see this very often.\n\n", "title": "\u300c1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "body": "1958\u5e74\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3002\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u56de\u5fa9\u3057\u3001RF\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3082\u4fee\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u7a00\u5c11\u3067\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u3063\u305f1958\u5e74\u306e\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30ebTR1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u300d", "\u300cAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u300d", "\u300c\u6642\u4ee3\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u6210\u679c\u300d", "\u300c\u30ab\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30cb\u30a2\u3067\u306eAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u306e\u4eca\u3068\u6614\u300d"]}

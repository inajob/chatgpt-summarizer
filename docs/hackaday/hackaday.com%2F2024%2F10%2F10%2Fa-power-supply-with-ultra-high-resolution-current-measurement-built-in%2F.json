[Gero M\u00fcller] was in that exact situation, and wasnt happy with the expensive off-the-shelf tools for doing the job. Thus, he built his own. Meet nanoTracer.\nnanoTracer measures small current draws in very high resolution.\nThe concept of the device is simple. Its a power supply that measures current on a nanoampere scale, and on microsecond intervals. It can deliver from 0 to 5.125 volts in 256 steps, and up to 100 mA of current. It has a sampling bandwidth of 1 MHz, at 2 million samples per second, with effective dynamic range from 100 mA all the way down to 100 nA. For capturing microscopic changes in current draw, thats invaluable. The device also features a UART for talking to an attached project directly, and additional pins for taking further ADC measurements where needed.\nRight now, its at an early prototype stage, and [Gero] tells us the software is very basic right now. Still, its easy to see how this device would be very useful to anyone working to optimize power consumption on low-power projects. One wonders if there are some applications in power-based side-channel attacks, too.\nWere hoping to learn more about nanoTracer from [Gero] soon\u2014how it was built, how it works, and what its really like to use. Perhaps one day down the line, the design might even become available for others that could use such a nifty tool. Theres no mucking about when you get down to nanoamps, after all. If youve cooked up something similar in your own lab, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

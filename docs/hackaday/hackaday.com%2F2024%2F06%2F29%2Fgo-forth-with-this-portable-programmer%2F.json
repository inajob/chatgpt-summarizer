There are open source options for the language which makes it accessible, and it maintains its prevalence in astronomical and other embedded systems for its direct hardware control and streamlined use of limited resources even though the language started over 50 years ago. Unlike 50 years ago, though, you can now take your own self-contained Forth programmer on the go with you.\nThe small computer is built on a design that [Dennis] built a while back called my4TH which has its own dedicated 8-bit CPU and can store data in a 256 kB EEPROM chip. Everything else needed for the computer is built in as well but that original design didnt include a few features that this one adds, most notably a small 404 character LCD and a keyboard. The build also adds a case to tie everything together, with ports on the back for I2C and power plus an RS232 port. An optional battery circuit lets the computer power up without an external power supply as well.\n\nPart of the appeal of Forth for systems like this is that it includes an interpreter and compiler in addition to the programming language itself, meaning that it has everything needed for a usable computer system built right in. For some more details on this unique language, or if youd like to explore below the world of Python or C, check out [Elliot]s discussion on the hackers language.. While Forth can tackle big problems, it can fit on tiny machines, too.", "title": "Forth\u8a00\u8a9e\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u3068\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "body": "Forth\u306f\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u8aad\u307f\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3082\u4fdd\u6301\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u8a00\u8a9e\u306b\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u3068\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306b\u597d\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3082Forh\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u3092\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Forth\u8a00\u8a9e\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u3068\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u81ea\u4f5c\uff1amy4TH\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3055", "Forth\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d7\u30ea\u30bf\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u74b0\u5883", "\u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u73fe\u5728\u3078\uff1a50\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u304b\u3089\u5805\u5b9f\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3078", "\u53e4\u3044\u8a00\u8a9e\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7528\u9014\uff1aForth\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u5e45\u5e83\u3044\u5fdc\u7528"]}

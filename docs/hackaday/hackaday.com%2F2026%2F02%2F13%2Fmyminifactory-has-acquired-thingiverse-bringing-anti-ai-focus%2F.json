Yet with the veritable flood of models on these sites you also want to have some level of quality. Here recent news pertaining to Thingiverse is probably rather joyful, as with the acquisition of Thingiverse by MyMiniFactory, it should remain one of the most friendly sites for sharing 3D printing models.\nAlthough Thingiverse as a concept probably doesnt need much introduction, its important here to acknowledge the tumultuous times that it has gone through since its launch in 2008 as part of MakerBot. Both were acquired by Stratasys in 2013, and this has lead to ups and downs in the relationship with Thingiverses user base.\nMyMiniFactory was launched in 2013 as a similar kind of 3D printing object-sharing platform as Thingiverse, while also offering crowdsourcing and paid model options. In the MyMiniFactory blog post its stated that these features will not be added to Thingiverse, and that nothing should change for Thingiverse users in this regard.\nWhat does change is its joining of the SoulCrafted initiative, which is an initiative against machine-generated content, including so-called AI slop. There will be a live Q  A on February 17th during which the community can pitch their questions and ideas, along with a dedicated Thingiverse group.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u5c55\u958b\uff1aThingiverse\u304cMyMiniFactory\u306b\u8cb7\u53ce", "body": "Thingiverse\u304cMyMiniFactory\u306b\u8cb7\u53ce\u3055\u308c\u30013D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u5171\u6709\u306e\u8cea\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3002\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u305a\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u306f\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u5c55\u958b\uff1aThingiverse\u304cMyMiniFactory\u306b\u8cb7\u53ce", "- Thingiverse\u3068MyMiniFactory\uff1a3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u5171\u6709\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- MakerBot\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5909\u9077\uff1aThingiverse\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u9032\u5316", "- SoulCrafted\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30a2\u30c1\u30d6\u53c2\u52a0\uff1aThingiverse\u304c\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u54c1\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\uff1aThingiverse\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6Q&A\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u958b\u50ac"]}

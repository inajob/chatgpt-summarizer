So, if you think about it, it isnt surprising hes talking about GPS  after all, the system uses satellites. GPS is used in everything these days, and other forms of navigation are starting to fall by the wayside. However, the problem is that the system is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. This is especially important if you fear GPS allowing missiles or drones to strike precise targets. But there are also plenty of opportunities for malicious acts. For example, drone light shows may be subject to GPS attacks from rival companies, and you can easily imagine worse. [Scott] talks about the issues around GPS spoofing in the video, which you can see below.\nSince GPS satellites are distant, blocking the signal is almost too easy, sometimes happening inadvertently. GPS has technology to operate in the face of noise and interference, but theres no way to prevent it entirely. Spoofing  where you produce false GPS coordinates  is much more difficult.\n\nOf course, jamming or spoofing GPS is highly illegal, and it is easy to locate jammers, so most people doing this will be state actors and military units. Dont try this at home. But it does happen, and [Scott] mentions how warnings appear to alert pilots of areas where GPS may be unreliable due to jamming and spoofing.\nThere are anti-jamming countermeasures you can employ. But things like this tend to be leapfrog situations, where jammers will overcome the countermeasures only to face better countermeasures theyll have to overcome again later.\nAs you might expect, this isnt a how-to video, but just talks about the ideas behind jamming and spoofing along with the potential countermeasures. While you usually buy a module to do GPS, you can roll your own. If you want a detailed explainer, we got you.\n", "title": "GPS\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066[Scott Manley]\u304c\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "[Scott Manley]\u306f\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002GPS\u306f\u885b\u661f\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u304b\u3089\u3001\u5f7c\u304cGPS\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f\u9a5a\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u906e\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u3060\u304c\u3001GPS\u306f\u305d\u306e\u5bfe\u51e6\u6cd5\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002GPS\u306e\u6b3a\u779e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u4e0d\u6cd5\u884c\u70ba\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u884c\u70ba\u8005\u3084\u8ecd\u968a\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["GPS\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066[Scott Manley]\u304c\u89e3\u8aac", "GPS\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u653b\u6483\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8b70\u8ad6", "GPS\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "GPS\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "GPS\u653b\u6483\u304b\u3089\u8eab\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

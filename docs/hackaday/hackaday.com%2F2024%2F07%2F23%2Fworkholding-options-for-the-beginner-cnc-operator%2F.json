You also have to keep it in place while the machine does its work. [Garrett Fromme] walks us through five different work holding techniques.\nSince every project is different and stock material can vary from thin veneer to much larger pieces, theres no one right work holding method for every project, and not all methods are applicable to all materials. A vise is great for small projects that need to be held very securely and wont be damaged, vacuum tables can make switching pieces quick in a production environment, fasteners will hold a piece securely at the expense of your spoil board, clamps are fairly versatile but fiddly to setup, and tape and CA glue are quick but require more consumables.\n[Fromme] does a quick demonstration of setups with these different methods and their limitations, which is a great place to start for the beginner CNC operator. Just like 3D printers, CNCs are a far cry from the replicators in Star Trek that can automagically create what you ask it to, but proper workholding lets you waste less material and operate the machine more safely.\nOur own [Elliot Williams] had a look at how CNCs arent as automated as you think. If you do need some CNC clamps, you might try these printable parametric clamps, or if you want something more beautiful, give these metal toe clamps a go.\n\n"}

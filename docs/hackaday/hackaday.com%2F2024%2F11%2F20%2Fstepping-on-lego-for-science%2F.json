For us, those little caltrops come to mind most immediately, and wed probably be satisfied with believing that was the answer. But not [Nate Scovill]. He had to quantitatively find out one way or another.\nAnd no, the research did not involve stepping on one of each of the thousands of LEGO pieces in existence. [Nate] started by building a test rig that approximated the force of his own 150 lb. frame stepping on each piece under scrutiny and seeing what it did to a cardboard substrate.\nAnd how did [Nate] narrow down which pieces to try? He took to the proverbial streets and asked redditors and Discordians to help him come up with a list of subjects.\nIf you love LEGO to the point where you cant bear to see it destroyed, then this video is not for you. But if you need to know the semi-scientific answer as badly as we did, then go for it. The best part is round two, when [Nate] makes a foot out of ballistics gel to rate the worst from the first test. So, whats the worst LEGO to step on? The answer may surprise you.\nAnd whats more dangerous than plain LEGO? A LEGO Snake, we reckon.\n\n", "title": "\u6700\u3082\u75db\u3044LEGO\u306f\u3069\u308c\uff1f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c", "body": "LEGO\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u6700\u3082\u75db\u3044\u306e\u306f\u3069\u308c\u304b\u3092\u5b9f\u9a13\u3057\u3001\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5206\u6790\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u6700\u3082\u75db\u3044LEGO\u306f\u3069\u308c\uff1f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c", "LEGO\u306e\u5384\u4ecb\u306a\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u3001\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u5224\u660e\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\uff1f", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8 rig\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLEGO\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u5b9f\u9a13", "Reddit\u3068Discord\u306e\u529b\u3092\u501f\u308a\u305fLEGO\u8abf\u67fb", "\u30d0\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u8db3\u3067\u8a55\u4fa1\u3057\u305fLEGO\u306e\u75db\u307f\u5ea6\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0"]}

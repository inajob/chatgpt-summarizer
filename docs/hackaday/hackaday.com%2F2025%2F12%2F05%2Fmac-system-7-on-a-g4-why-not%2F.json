There have been many overlapping versions, but theres always a point at which a certain OS wont run on newer hardware. Now [Jubadub] has pushed one of those a little further than Apple intended, by persuading classic Mac System 7 to run on a G4.\nSystem 7 was the OS your Mac would have run some time in the mid 90s, whether it was a later 68000 machine or a first-gen PowerMac. In its day it gave Windows 3.x and even 95 a run for their money, but it relied on an older Mac ROM architecture than the one found on a G4. The hack here lies in leaked ROMS, hidden backwards compatibility, and an unreleased but preserved System 7 version originally designed for the 90s Mac clone programme axed by Steve Jobs.\u00a0 Its not perfect, but they achieved the impossible.\nAs to why, it seems theres a significant amount of software that needs 7 to run, something mirrored in the non-Mac retrocomputing world. Even this hack isnt the most surprising System 7 one weve seen recently, as an example someone even made a version for x86 machines.\n\nThumbnail Image Art: Apple PowerMac G4 by baku13, CC BY-SA 3.0", "title": "\u300c\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30afMac OS 7\u3092G4\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "body": "\u53e4\u3044Mac OS System 7\u304cG4\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30afMac OS 7\u3092G4\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "\u300c90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eOS\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u518d\u751f\u300d", "\u300cApple\u306e\u53e4\u3044OS\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u300d", "\u300cSystem 7\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\u306eMac\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d"]}

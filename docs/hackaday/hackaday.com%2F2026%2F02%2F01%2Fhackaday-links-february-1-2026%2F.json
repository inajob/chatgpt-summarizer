Created by [Potch], it works like one of those falling sand simulators, with sliders that let you control various elements of the wintry action. For more a immersive experience, open the window and let some cold air in while you play.\nIf those old school graphics have you yearning for a simpler time, then youll love Places to Telnet, a page on the very slick CRT-themed telnet.org that lists servers you can connect to. The list is made up primarily of games, but theres also systems you can call up to do things like show the weather or browse Wikipedia. They even take submissions, so if you know any interesting destinations that arent on the list, make sure to share with the class.\nOur ability to make and use tools is one of the things that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom, and is an ability not often seen outside of primates. But a recent paper in Current Biology describes how one cow, Veronika, has been observed using a long-handled brush to scratch herself. Apparently the clever heifer will even flip the brush around and use the handle side when she wants to really dig in there. The paper says the findings invite a reassessment of livestock cognition, and points out that little serious research has been done on bovine intelligence in the 10,000 or so years since humans first domesticated them. Were just happy this paper came out when it did  that way it will be a distant memory by the time we fire up the grill in the summer.\n\nGet ready for Planet of the Cows\nWhile the cows might be catching up to us, were still comfortably ahead of them in terms of spaceflight. Those eagerly awaiting humanitys return to the Moon will have to wait a little longer however, as NASA has pushed back the wet dress rehearsal for Artemis II. This in turn has kicked the actual launch a few days farther down the road, and realistically, is probably the first of several delays as the space agency checks and re-checks the SLS rocket and Orion capsule before liftoff.\nThe launch rehearsal was supposed to start last night, but was delayed due to the unusually cold weather at the Cape  a wise precaution given the Shuttle-lineage of the SLS, especially as were just a few days past the 40th anniversary of the Challenger disaster.\nWhile on the subject of returning to the Moon, Blue Origin has announced that they are pausing space tourism flights aboard their New Shepard rocket for at least two years so that they can better focus their energies on developing the Blue Moon lunar lander. Its a bit hard to believe the two programs could have much overlap, or that the Jeff Bezos backed company doesnt have the resources to pursue both simultaneously. Seems more likely that demand for suborbital joyrides isnt what they hoped for, especially after the public backlash several of the celebrity passengers experienced after their flight. With Virgin Galactic still in the middle of their own multi-year pause on commercial flights, the entire sub-orbital tourism industry (such as it is) is effectively on hold for the time being.\nSuborbital flights for the wealthy will likely return one day, but by the time you read this, Belkin will have permanently pulled the plug on almost all of their Wemo smart gadgets. While Belkins cloud services for the devices has now gone dark, they note that any devices in the wild that were configured to work with Thread or Apples HomeKit will continue to work in local mode. Were no strangers to seeing IoT devices go belly-up, but the end of Wemo still feels significant. Introduced in 2011, they were an early success story in a now flooded market.\nWhile the average Wemo owner is out of luck, theres good news for hackers. Tools and libraries which interact with Wemo devices on the local network such as pywemo are reportedly unaffected by the cloud shutdown. So if you see any of these devices popping up on the second-hand market, or maybe even the trash, they can still be put to use. If you manage to rescue some of these smart gadgets from the landfill, make sure to let us know.\n\nSee something interesting that you think would be a good fit for our weekly Links column?

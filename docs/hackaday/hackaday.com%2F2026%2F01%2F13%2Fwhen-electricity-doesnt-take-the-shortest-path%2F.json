This is where the PCB presented by [ElectrArc240] on YouTube is rather confusing, as it demonstrates two similarly sized traces, one of which is much shorter than the other, yet the current opts to travel via the much longer trace. If you were to measure this PCB between each path, the shorter path has the lowest resistance at 0.44 \u03a9 while the longer path is 1.44 \u03a9. Did the laws of physics break down here?\nOf course, this is just a trick question, as the effective resistance for an electrical circuit isnt just about ohmic resistance. Instead the relevant phrasing here is path of least impedance, which is excellently demonstrated here using this PCB. Note that its return path sneaks on the back side along the same path as the long path on the front. To this is added a 1 MHz high current source that demonstrates the impact of alternating current, with reactance combining with the resistance.\nAlthough for direct current its fair to say that impedance is the equivalent of resistance, once the inductance of a trace has to be taken into account  as in the case of AC and high-frequency signaling  the much higher inductance of the short path means that now the long path is actually the shortest.\nWhen you are doing some impedance matching in your favorite EDA software while implementing an Ethernet RMII link or similar, this is basically part of the process, with higher frequencies requiring ever more stringent mechanisms to keep both sides happy. At some point any stray signals from nearby traces and components become a factor, never mind the properties of the PCB material.\n\n", "title": "- \u77ed\u3044\u914d\u7dda\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u9078\u629e\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f", "body": "PCB\u306e\u77ed\u3044\u901a\u8def\u304c\u4f4e\u62b5\u6297\u306a\u306e\u306b\u9577\u3044\u901a\u8def\u3092\u901a\u308b\u7406\u7531\u306f\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u3067\u306f\u9577\u3044\u7d4c\u8def\u304c\u77ed\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u77ed\u3044\u914d\u7dda\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u9078\u629e\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f", "- PCB\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9577\u3055\u3088\u308a\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u6d41\u308c\uff1a\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- \u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- EDA\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u5b66\u3076"]}

Even the cheapest meter today would have been an incredible piece of lab gear not long ago and, often, meters today are lighter and have more features than the old Radio Shack meters we grew up with. But then there are bench meters. [Learn Electronics Repair] reviews an OWON XDM1241 meter, and you have to wonder if it is better than just a decent handheld device. Check out the video below and see what you think.\nSome of the advantage of a bench meter is just convenience. They stay in one place and often have a bigger display than a handheld. Of course, these days, the bench meter isnt much better than a handheld anyway. In fact, one version of this meter even has a battery, if you want to carry it around.\n\nTraditionally, bench meters had more digits and counts, although thats not always true anymore. This meter has 55,000 counts with four and a half digits. It has a large LCD, can connect to a PC, and measures frequency, temperature, and capacitance.\nOur bench meters usually have four-wire resistance measurement, but that does not seem to be the case for these meters. It does, however, take frequent measurements, which is a plus when ringing out continuity, for example.\nThe meter isnt perfect, but if you just want a bench meter, it works well enough. If we had the space, we might opt for a bigger old surplus Fluke or similar. But if you want something new or you are short on space, this might be fine.\nIf you want to know what you are missing by not having four-wire measurements, we can help you with that. If you get any of these cheaper meters, we urge you to upgrade your probes immediately.\n", "title": "- \u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\u3055", "body": "OWON XDM1241\u306f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u6e2c\u5b9a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5145\u5b9f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\u3055", "- OWON XDM1241\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "- \u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9"]}

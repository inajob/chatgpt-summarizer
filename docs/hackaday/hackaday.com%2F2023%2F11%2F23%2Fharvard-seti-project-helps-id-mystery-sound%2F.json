Naturally aliens were blamed by some, while cooler heads theorized it may have been a sonic boom from a military aircraft. But without any evidence, who could say?\nLuckily for concerned residents, this was precisely the sort of event Harvards Galileo Project was designed to investigate. Officially described as a way to search for technological signatures of Extraterrestrial Technological Civilizations (ETCs), the project keeps a constant watch on the sky with a collection of cameras and microphones. With their gear, the team was able to back up the anecdotal reports with with hard data.\n\nAs explained in a recent article on The Debrief written by project head [Avi Loeb], none of Galileos optical equipment captured anything interesting at the time. But its acoustic monitoring, omni-directional system (AMOS), which records from the infrasonic all the way to ultrasonic (specifically, 0.05 hertz to 190 kilohertz), got an earful during the 12-second event.\n[Avi] was able to take the data collected by AMOS and run it through the Taylor\u2013von Neumann\u2013Sedov solution, which was originally developed during World War II to estimate how much energy was released during the detonation of a nuclear bomb from the spherical blast-wave it produced.\nBy plugging the amplitude and duration of the pressure wave into the equation, he calculated an energy release of approximately 2.4 kilotons of TNT at a distance of about 40 kilometers (25 miles).\nSince the detonation of a tactical nuclear weapon within a 40 km radius of Mount Washington would likely have been noticed by somebody, the likely culprit would therefore be some object entering the Earths atmosphere.\nAs it turns out, the Orionid meteor shower was just about at its peak in the skies over Massachusetts at that point. Given the average velocity of these particular meteors (66 km/s), [Avi] figures the source of the sound was a space rock of about a meter in diameter meeting its fiery end.\nWe know, aliens would have been more fun. But this is precisely the sort of grounded research that needs to happen for Unidentified Anomalous/Aerial Phenomena (UAP) to be taken seriously. We hadnt heard of the Galileo Project before this, but will certainly be keeping an eye on its findings going forward.\nThanks to [PWalsh] for the tip."}

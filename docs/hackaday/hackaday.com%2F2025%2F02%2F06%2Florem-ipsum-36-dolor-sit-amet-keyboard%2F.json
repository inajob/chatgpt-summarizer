[penkia] couldnt find any PCBs with 36 keys and Gateron low-profile switch footprints, so they made their own and called it the LoremIpsum36. Isnt it lovely?\nThis baby runs on an RP2040, which sits flush as can be in a cutout in the PCB. This maneuver, along with the LP switches in hard-to-find SK-33 sockets results in quite the thin board.\n[penkia] says that despite using a 3 mm tray for added rigidity, the entire thing is thinner than the Nuphy Air60 v2, which is just over half an inch (13.9 mm) thick. For keycaps, [penkia] has used both XVX profile and FKcaps LPF.\nAnd yeah, that area in the middle is crying out for something; maybe a trackball or something similar. But [penkia] is satisfied with it as-is for the first version, so we are, too.\nDo you like 36-key boards, but prefer curves? Check out the Lapa keyboard, which doubles as a mouse.", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u3067\u4f5c\u308b36\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cLoremIpsum36\u300d", "body": "36\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cLoremIpsum36\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002RP2040\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u8584\u578b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u3067\u4f5c\u308b36\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cLoremIpsum36\u300d", "- RP2040\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u8584\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Gateron\u4f4e\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u63a1\u7528\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u4f59\u767d\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "- \u66f2\u7dda\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e36\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cLapa\u300d\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

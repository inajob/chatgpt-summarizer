Thats what [Keizo Ishibashi] did to create his Cantareel, a modified guitar that actually sounds like a hurdy-gurdy.\nWe wrote recently about a makers quest to create just such a hybrid instrument, and why it ended in failure: pressing strings onto the fretboard also pushed them tighter to the wheel, ruining the all-important tension. To recap, the spinning wheel of a hurdy-gurdy excites the strings exactly like a violin bow, and like a violin bow, the pressure has to be just right. Theres no evidence [Keizo Ishibashi] was aware of that work, but he solved the problem regardless, simply by thinking outside the box  the soundbox, that is.\nUnlike a hurdy-gurdy, the Cantareel keeps its wheel outside the soundbox. The wheel also does not rub directly upon the strings: instead, it turns what appears to be a pair of o-rings. Each rosined o-ring bows 2 of the guitars strings, giving four strings a singing. (Five golden rings can only be assumed.) The outer two strings of this ex-six-string are used to hold the wheel assembly in place by feeding through holes on the mounting arms. The guitar is otherwise unmodified, making this hack reversible.\nIt differs from the classic hurdy-gurdy in one particular: on the Cantareel, every string is a drone string. Theres no way to keep the rubber rings from rubbing against the strings, so all four are always singing. This may just be the price you pay to get that smooth gurdy sound out of a guitar form factor. Were not even sure its right to call it a price when it sounds this good.\n\n\nThanks to [Petitefromage] for the tip. If you run into any wild and wonderful instruments, dont forget to let us know."}

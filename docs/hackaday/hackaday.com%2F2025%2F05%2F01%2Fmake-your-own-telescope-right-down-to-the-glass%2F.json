You dont have to be a professional to build one though; you can make all kinds of telescopes as an amateur, as this guide from the Springfield Telesfcope Makers demonstrates.\nThe guide is remarkably deep and rich; no surprise given that the Springfield Telescope Makers club dates back to the early 20th century. It starts out with the basics\u2014how to select a telescope, and how to decide whether to make or buy your desired instrument. It also explains in good detail why you might want to start with a simple Newtonian reflector setup on Dobsonian mounts if youre crafting your first telescope, in no small part because mirrors are so much easier to craft than lenses for the amateur. From there, the guide gets into the nitty gritty of mirror production, right down to grinding and polishing techniques, as well as how to test your optical components and assemble your final telescope.\nIts hard to imagine a better place to start than here as an amateur telescope builder. Its a rich mine of experience and practical advice that should give you the best possible chance of success. You might also like to peruse some of the other telescope projects weve covered previously. And, if you succeed, you can always tell us of your tales on the tipsline!", "title": "- \u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u7d20\u4eba\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u5929\u4f53\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3002\u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u6210\u529f\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u6e80\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u5f0f\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\uff1a\u7814\u78e8\u304b\u3089\u7d44\u7acb\u307e\u3067", "- \u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u88fd\u4f5c\u8005\u30af\u30e9\u30d6\u306e\u77e5\u6075", "- \u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

Theyre normally sized to float around a sink or bathtub. [Steve Mould] recently got the opportunity to board a much larger example,\u00a0 sized for an actual human passenger.\nThe boat belongs to the The AHHAA Science Center in Estonia, along with a smaller model about half the size. Both are fired by propane gas burners to give them some real heat output into the water tank, far beyond what youd get from little tea light candles. In the case of the larger boat, it uses a series of valves to allow the tank to be filled with water while the rear thrust pipes are closed.\nAt the larger scale, its more easy to visualize the flow out of the boats rear outlets. Its by no means a fast way to get around on the water, with a top speed somewhat less than walking pace. Its also very loud. Regardless, its amusing to see the pop-pop engine work even when scaled up to full size.\nIf youre looking for an in-depth explanation of how pop-pop boats work, [Steve Mould] has covered that previously. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u5927\u4eba\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01\u5b9f\u7269\u5927\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u8239\u306e\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u4f53\u9a13", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30da\u30fc\u30f3\u30ac\u30b9\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u52d5\u304f\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306aPop-pop\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2\u306eAHHAA\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u5927\u4eba\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01\u5b9f\u7269\u5927\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u8239\u306e\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u4f53\u9a13", "\u672c\u7269\u306e\u706b\u529b\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u8239\u3092\u898b\u3088\u3046", "\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2\u306eAHHAA\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5b9f\u7269\u5927\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u8239\u767b\u5834", "\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u5b9f\u7269\u5927\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u8239\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac\uff01\u305d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

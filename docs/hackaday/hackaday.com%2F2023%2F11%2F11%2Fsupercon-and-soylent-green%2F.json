I couldn\u2019t ask everyone, but a great time was had by everyone I talked to. It\u2019s honestly a very special crowd that shows up in Pasadena every November, and it\u2019s really the attendees who make it what it is. We just provide the platform to watch you shine. Thank you all!\nIt all started out on Friday with an open day of chilling out and badge experimentation. Well, chill for those of you who didn\u2019t have a bug in their badge code, anyway. But thanks to some very keen observation and fantastic bug reports by attendees, Al and I figured out what we\u2019d done and pushed a fix out to all 300 of the badges that were given out on the first day. And thanks to the remaining 200 folks who walked in the next day, who fixed their own badges at Tom\u2019s Flashing Station.\n\nFrom then on, it was one great talk after another, punctuated by badge hacks and all the other crazy stuff that people brought along with them to show off. For me, one of the highlights was on Sunday morning, as the Lightning Talks gave people who were there a chance to get up and talk about whatever for seven minutes. And subjects ranged from a mad explosive propane balloon party, to Scotty Allen\u2019s experience with a bad concussion and how he recovered, to a deep dive into the world of LED strands and soft sculptures from our go-to guru of blinkiness, Debra [Geek Mom] Ansell.\nSupercon first-timer Katie [Smalls] Connell gave a phenomenal talk about her wearable LED art things, Spritelights. These are far from simple art pieces, being a combination of medical adhesive, home-mixed Galinstan \u2013 a metal alloy that stays flexible at human body temperature, and soon even flexible printed batteries. That this whole project hit us without warning from out of the audience just made it more impressive.\nAnd these were just the folks who stepped up on stage. The true story of Supercon also belongs to all the smaller conversations and personal demos taking place in the alley or by the coffee stand. Who knows how many great ideas were hatched, or at least seeds planted?\nSo as always, thank you all for coming and bringing your passions along with. Just like Soylent Green, Supercon is made of people, and it wouldn\u2019t be half as yummy without you. See you all next year. And if you\u2019re thinking of joining us, get your tickets early and/or submit a talk proposal when the time comes around. You won\u2019t meet a more warm and welcoming bunch of nerds anywhere.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

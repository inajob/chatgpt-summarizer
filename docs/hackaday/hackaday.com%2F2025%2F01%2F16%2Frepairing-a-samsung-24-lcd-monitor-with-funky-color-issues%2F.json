(Credit: MisterHW)\nDumpster diving is one of those experiences that can net you some pretty cool gear for a reasonable price. Case in point the 24 Samsung S24E650XW LCD monitor that [MisterHW] saved from being trashed. Apparently in very good condition with no visible external damage, the unit even powered up without issues. It seemed like a golden find until he got onto the Windows desktop and began to notice quaint red shimmering in darker areas and other issues that made it clear why the monitor had been tossed. Of course, the second best part about dumpster diving is seeing whether you can repair such issues.\nPrior to disassembly it had been noted that percussive maintenance and bending of the frame changed the symptoms, suggesting that something was a bit loose inside. After taking the back cover and shielded enclosure off, a quick visual inspection of the boards and cables quickly revealed the likely suspect: broken traces on one of the cables.\nApparently somewhere during the assembly step in the factory the cable had been pushed against the PCBs edge, causing the initial damage. Based on the listed assembly date the monitor had only been in use for a few years before it was tossed, so likely the symptoms would have begun and worsened as one after another of the traces gradually cracked and broke due to vibrations, thermal expansion, etc.\nThis issue made fixing the monitor very simple, however, assuming a suitable replacement cable could be found. The broken cable is a 30P 1.0 pitch PFC, with EBay throwing up a cable with similar specs for a Thomson brand TV. One purchase and anxious wait later, the replacement cable was installed as in the featured image alongside the old cable. Perhaps unsurprisingly it restored the monitor to full working order, demonstrating once again that dumpster diving is totally worth it.", "title": "- \u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\uff01\u4fee\u7406\u6210\u529f\u306eSamsung\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "\u5ec3\u68c4\u3055\u308c\u305fSamsung\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3066\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\uff01\u4fee\u7406\u6210\u529f\u306eSamsung\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u6551\u51fa", "- \u6545\u969c\u539f\u56e0\u767a\u898b\uff01\u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u7c21\u5358\u4fee\u7406\u3067\u8607\u3063\u305fSamsung\u306e24\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1LCD\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u8ce2\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u5ec3\u54c1\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u4fee\u7406\u6280\u8853"]}

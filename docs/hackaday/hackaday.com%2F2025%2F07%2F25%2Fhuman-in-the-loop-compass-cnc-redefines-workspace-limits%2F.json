The Compass CNC addresses this limitation by incorporating the operator as part of the gantry system.\nThe Compass CNC features a compact core-XY gantry that moves the router only a few inches in each direction, along with Z-axis control to set the router\u2019s depth. However, a work envelope of just a few inches would be highly restrictive. The innovation of the Compass CNC lies in its reliance on the operator to handle gross positioning of the gantry over the workpiece, while the machine manages the precise, detailed movements required for cutting.\nMost of the Compass CNC is constructed from 3D printed parts, with a commercial router performing the cutting. A Teensy 4.1 serves as the control unit, managing the gantry motors, and a circular screen provides instructions to guide the operator on where to position the tool.\nThose familiar with CNC routers may notice similarities to the Shaper Origin. However, key differences set the Compass CNC apart. Primarily, it is an open source project with design files freely available for those who want to build their own. Additionally, while the Shaper Origin relies on a camera system for tracking movement, the Compass CNC uses four mouse sensors to detect its position over the workpiece.\nThe Compass CNC is still in development, and kits containing most of the necessary components for assembly are available. We\u2019re excited to see the innovative creations that emerge from this promising new tool.\n\n"}

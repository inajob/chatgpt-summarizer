Selling for $999 it claims to be the first open-everything, affordable, high-bandwidth, real-time sampling USB oscilloscope.\nThe firmware and software are under active development and a new version was released yesterday.\n\nThe hardware has an impressive array of features packed into a slick aluminum case with quiet 40 mm internal fan and 220 x 165 x 35 mm (8.66 x 6.5 x 1.38 in) form-factor weighing in at 0.9 kg (1.98 lbs). Also available is an active probe supporting up to 2 GHz analog bandwidth.\nThe Haasoscope Pro is miles ahead of alternatives such as this USB oscilloscope from back in 2010 and you can find a bunch of support material on GitHub: drandyhaas/HaasoscopePro.\n", "title": "- Haasoscope Pro: 2 GHz\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u3092\u6301\u3064\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "body": "Haasoscope Pro\u306f2GHz\u5e2f\u57df\u300112\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306eUSB\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u3001999\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- Haasoscope Pro: 2 GHz\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u3092\u6301\u3064\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "- \u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u3068\u9ad8\u901f\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fHaasoscope Pro\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u624b\u306e\u5c4a\u304f\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdUSB\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7", "- \u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305fHaasoscope Pro", "- GitHub\u3067\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d20\u6750\u304c\u5145\u5b9f\uff01Haasoscope Pro\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

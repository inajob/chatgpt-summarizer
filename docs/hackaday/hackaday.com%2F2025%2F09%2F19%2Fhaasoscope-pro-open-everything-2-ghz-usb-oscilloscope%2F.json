Selling for $999 it claims to be the first open-everything, affordable, high-bandwidth, real-time sampling USB oscilloscope.\nThe firmware and software are under active development and a new version was released yesterday.\n\nThe hardware has an impressive array of features packed into a slick aluminum case with quiet 40 mm internal fan and 220 x 165 x 35 mm (8.66 x 6.5 x 1.38 in) form-factor weighing in at 0.9 kg (1.98 lbs). Also available is an active probe supporting up to 2 GHz analog bandwidth.\nThe Haasoscope Pro is miles ahead of alternatives such as this USB oscilloscope from back in 2010 and you can find a bunch of support material on GitHub: drandyhaas/HaasoscopePro.\n"}

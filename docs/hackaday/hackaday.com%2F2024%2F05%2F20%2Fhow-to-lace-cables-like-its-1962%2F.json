Here is a short how-to on how to lace cables from a 1962 document, thoughtfully made available on the web by [Gary Allsebrook] and [Jeff Dairiki].\nIts a short resource that is to the point in all the ways we love to see. The diagrams are very clear and the descriptions are concise, and everything is done for a reason. The knots are self-locking, ensuring that things stay put without being overly tight or constrictive.\nAccording to the document, the ideal material for lacing cables is a ribbon-like nylon cord (which reduces the possibility of biting into wire insulation compared to a cord with a round profile) but the knots and techniques apply to whatever material one may wish to use.\nCable lacing can be done ad-hoc, but back in the day cable assemblies were made separately and electrically tested on jigs prior to installation. In a way, such assemblies served a similar purpose to traces on a circuit board today.\nNeatly wrapping cables really has its place, and while doing so by hand can be satisfying, weve also seen custom-made tools for neatly wrapping cables with PTFE tape.", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30cf\u30fc\u30cd\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30cf\u30fc\u30cd\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u3068\u4e00\u8cab\u6027\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u6587\u66f8\u306b\u8a18\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u7d50\u3076\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30ca\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u306f\u81ea\u5df1\u4fdd\u6301\u3002\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb\u30f3\u306f\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30cf\u30fc\u30cd\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "1962\u5e74\u306e\u6587\u66f8\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u7d50\u3073\u65b9", "\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "PTFE\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5de5\u5177"]}

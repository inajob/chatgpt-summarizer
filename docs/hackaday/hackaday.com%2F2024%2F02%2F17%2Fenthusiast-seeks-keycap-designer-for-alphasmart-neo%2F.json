These purpose-built machines created by an offshoot of Apple engineers were way cheaper than the average laptop at the time, and far more prepared to be handed over to the average child. The salesmen used to drop-kick them at trade shows to demonstrate their toughness.\nToday, these machines are revered by writers, especially those who participate in NaNoWriMo, a yearly event in which people attempt to write the first draft of a novel during the month of November.\nThe Alphasmart NEO, NEO2, and Dana models are of particular note because they each have a really nice scissor-switch membrane keyboard. Yeah, thats right. A really nice membrane keyboard.\nThe problem is that things wear out with time. As you may have guessed, Alphasmart is no longer around, and so they cant offer replacement keycaps. Can you help by creating a 3D model? [E.F. Nordmed] and many others would sure appreciate it.\nYou may remember the Alphasmart NEO from these very pages. We sure do love them for distraction-free writing."}

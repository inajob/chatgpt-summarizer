Wouldnt it be so much simpler if you could just plug in like your phone? Dont try it yet, but biologists have taken us one step further to being able to fuel ourselves on those sweet, sweet electrons.\nUsing an \u201celectrobiological module\u201d of 3-4 enzymes, the amusingly named AAA (acid/aldehyde ATP) cycle regenerates ATP in biological systems directly from electricity. The process takes place at -0.6 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and is compatible with biological transcription/translation processes like RNA and protein synthesis from DNA.\nThe process isnt dependent on any membranes to foul or more complicated sets of enzymes making it ideal for\u00a0in vitro synthetic biology since you dont have to worry about keeping as many components in an ideal environment. Were particularly interested in how this might apply to DNA computing which we keep being promised will someday be the best thing since the transistor.\nMaybe in the future well all jack in instead of eating our daily food pill? If this all seems like something youve heard of before, but in reverse, maybe youre thinking of microbial fuel cells."}

By feeding back delayed voice audio to a persons ears, it makes it near-impossible for most people to speak, as our speech system runs on a continual feedback loop. [Benn Jordan] decided to try reworking that concept by replacing headphones with a directed sound projector.\nThe key to the project is the use of hypersonic sound arrays. These essentially use high-frequency sound beyond the human range of hearing to carry a lower-frequency sound signal. By essentially modulating this higher-frequency carrier to create the perception of lower-frequency sound, its possible to create an audible signal that is highly directional. Its like a sound laser that can be pointed directly at a person to allow them to hear it, which is then inaudible when pointed slightly away.\nThese allow the delayed voice signal to be fired at a persons head with a relatively narrow spatial spread. When an individual speaks into a microphone hooked up to the device, delayed audio is sent through the hypersonic array back to the speakers ears, garbling their speech as their brain gets confused by the feedback.\n[Benn] demonstrated the device in public by offering random individuals $100 to read a paragraph out of a book. The speech jammer worked a treat, and [Benn] was able to keep his money until one amazingly immune individual breezed through the test. Check out our prior coverage of speech jamming technology. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Hyperific for the tip!]", "title": "\u97f3\u58f0\u30b8\u30e3\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u8a3c\uff01\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u306b", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6301\u3064[Benn Jordan]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u8a71\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e\u306f\u3001\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u306e\u97f3\u3067\u4f1d\u9001\u3059\u308b\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u97f3\u97ff\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a3c\u660e\u52d5\u753b\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u97f3\u58f0\u30b8\u30e3\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u8a3c\uff01\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u306b", "\u97f3\u58f0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01\u9a5a\u6115\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u30b8\u30e3\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "\u97f3\u58f0\u30b8\u30e3\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u5927\u80c6\u306b\u6539\u826f\uff01\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30af\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u8a71\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u30b8\u30e3\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

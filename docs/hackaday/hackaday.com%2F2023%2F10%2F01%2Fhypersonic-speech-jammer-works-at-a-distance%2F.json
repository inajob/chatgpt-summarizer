By feeding back delayed voice audio to a persons ears, it makes it near-impossible for most people to speak, as our speech system runs on a continual feedback loop. [Benn Jordan] decided to try reworking that concept by replacing headphones with a directed sound projector.\nThe key to the project is the use of hypersonic sound arrays. These essentially use high-frequency sound beyond the human range of hearing to carry a lower-frequency sound signal. By essentially modulating this higher-frequency carrier to create the perception of lower-frequency sound, its possible to create an audible signal that is highly directional. Its like a sound laser that can be pointed directly at a person to allow them to hear it, which is then inaudible when pointed slightly away.\nThese allow the delayed voice signal to be fired at a persons head with a relatively narrow spatial spread. When an individual speaks into a microphone hooked up to the device, delayed audio is sent through the hypersonic array back to the speakers ears, garbling their speech as their brain gets confused by the feedback.\n[Benn] demonstrated the device in public by offering random individuals $100 to read a paragraph out of a book. The speech jammer worked a treat, and [Benn] was able to keep his money until one amazingly immune individual breezed through the test. Check out our prior coverage of speech jamming technology. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Hyperific for the tip!]"}

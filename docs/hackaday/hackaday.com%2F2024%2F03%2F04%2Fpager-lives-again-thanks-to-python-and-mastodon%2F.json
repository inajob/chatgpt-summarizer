Anyway, [Finnley Dolfin] had some pagers and gave them a refresh for the modern era, using them to receive message alerts from Mastodon.\nThe project is laced together with a bunch of Python code. It uses the Mastodon library for interacting with the social media website. When it detects an incoming direct message, it hooks into DAPNET  the Decentralized Amateur Paging Network.\u00a0 Via this network, a message is sent out over the airwaves to [Finnleys] pager, serving as a notification that someones reached out to chat on Mastodon.\nIts neat that the amateur radio world is keeping pagers alive, using distributed base stations to share messages. Unfortunately, given the existence of smartphones, we dont quite see pagers catching on again any time soon. And yet, [Finnleys] setup has a certain level of old-school cool that no modern phone could match.\nWeve seen only a handful of pager hacks over the years, but theyre still pretty neat. If youve got your own cooking up in the workshop, drop us a line, yeah?"}

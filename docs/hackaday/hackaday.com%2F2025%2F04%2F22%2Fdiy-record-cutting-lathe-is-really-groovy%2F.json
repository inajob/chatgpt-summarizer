Sure, if you had the scratch, you could go out and get a small batch of records made from that tape, but the machinery to do it was expensive and not always easy to come by, depending where you lived. That goes double today, but were in the middle of a vinyl renaissance! [ronald] wanted to make records, but was unable to find a lathe, so decided to take matters into his own hands, and build his own vinyl record cutting lathe.\n[ronalds] record cutting lathe looks quite professional.It seems like it should be a simple problem, at least in concept: wiggle an engraving needle to scratch grooves in plastic. Of course for a stereo record, the wiggling needs to be two-axis, and for stereo HiFi you need that wiggling to be very precise over a very large range of frequencies (7 Hz to 50 kHz, to match the pros). Then of course theres the question of how youre controlling the wiggling of this engraving needle. (In this case, its through a DAC, so technically this is a CNC hack.) As often happens, once you get down to brass tacks (or diamond styluses, as the case may be) the simple problem becomes a major project.\nThe build log discusses some of the challenges facedfor example, [ronald] started with locally made polycarbonate disks that werent quite up to the job, so he has resigned himself to purchasing professional vinyl blanks. The power to the cutting head seems to have kept creeping up with each revision: the final version, pictured here, has two 50 W tweeters driving the needle.\nThat necessitated a better amplifier, which helped improve frequency response. So it goes; the whole project took [ronald] fourteen months, but wed have to say it looks like it was worth it. It sounds worth it, too; [ronald] provides audio samples; check one out below.\u00a0 Every garage band in Queensland is going to be beating a path to [ronalds] door to get their jam sessions cut into real records, unless they agree that physical media deserved to die.\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('audio');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01_Test-Cut-6th-April-2025-Move-For-Me.wav\n\nDespite the supposedly well-deserved death of physical media, this isnt the first record cutter we have featured. If youd rather copy records than cut them, we have that too. Theres also the other kind of vinyl cutter, which might be more your speed.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30ed\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u304814\u304b\u6708\u304b\u3051\u3066\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "DIY\u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u6311\u6226\u3068\u6210\u679c", "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306a\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u88fd\u4f5c", "14\u30ab\u6708\u304b\u3051\u3066\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u97f3\u697d\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

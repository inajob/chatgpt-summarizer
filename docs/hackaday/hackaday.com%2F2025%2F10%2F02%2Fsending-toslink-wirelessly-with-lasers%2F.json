As demonstrated by [DIY Perks], this old tech can even be taught some new tricks  namely, transmitting surround sound wirelessly.\nOften, a TOSLINK stream is transmitted with a simple LED. [DIY Perks] realized that the TOSLINK signal could instead be used to modulate a cheap red laser diode. This would allow the audio signal to be sent wirelessly through the open air for quite some distance, assuming you could accurately aim it at a TOSLINK receiver. The first test was successful, with the aid of a nifty trick, [DIY Perks] filled the open TOSLINK port with a translucent plastic diffuser to make a larger target to aim at.\nThe rest of the video demonstrates how this technique can be used for surround sound transmission without cables. [DIY Perks] whipped up a series of 3D printed ceiling mirror mounts that could tidily bounce laser light for each surround channel to each individual satellite speaker.\nIts a very innovative way to do surround sound. Its not a complete solution to wiring issues\u2014you still need a way to power each speaker. Ultimately, though, its a super cool way to run your home theater setup that will surely be a talking point when your guests notice the laser mirrors on the ceiling.\nWeve seen some other stealthy surround sound setups before, too.\n\n\n[Thanks to jenningsthecat for the tip!]", "title": "\u5149\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u9001\u308bTOSLINK\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "TOSLINK\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u7121\u7dda\u4f1d\u9001\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u5149\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u9001\u308bTOSLINK\u306e\u9032\u5316", "DIY\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7121\u7dda\u30b5\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u97f3\u58f0\u9001\u4fe1\u6280\u8853", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067TOSLINK\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u7121\u7dda\u4f1d\u9001\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u30b5\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u7528\u30df\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3067\u5909\u308f\u308b\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30a2\u30bf\u30fc\u4f53\u9a13"]}

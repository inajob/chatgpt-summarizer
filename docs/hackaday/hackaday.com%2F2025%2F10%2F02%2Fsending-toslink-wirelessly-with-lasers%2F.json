As demonstrated by [DIY Perks], this old tech can even be taught some new tricks  namely, transmitting surround sound wirelessly.\nOften, a TOSLINK stream is transmitted with a simple LED. [DIY Perks] realized that the TOSLINK signal could instead be used to modulate a cheap red laser diode. This would allow the audio signal to be sent wirelessly through the open air for quite some distance, assuming you could accurately aim it at a TOSLINK receiver. The first test was successful, with the aid of a nifty trick, [DIY Perks] filled the open TOSLINK port with a translucent plastic diffuser to make a larger target to aim at.\nThe rest of the video demonstrates how this technique can be used for surround sound transmission without cables. [DIY Perks] whipped up a series of 3D printed ceiling mirror mounts that could tidily bounce laser light for each surround channel to each individual satellite speaker.\nIts a very innovative way to do surround sound. Its not a complete solution to wiring issues\u2014you still need a way to power each speaker. Ultimately, though, its a super cool way to run your home theater setup that will surely be a talking point when your guests notice the laser mirrors on the ceiling.\nWeve seen some other stealthy surround sound setups before, too.\n\n\n[Thanks to jenningsthecat for the tip!]"}

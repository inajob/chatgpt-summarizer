In the video embedded below by [NeedItMakeIt] you can see a head-to-head comparison for one specific product he makes, CRATER, a magnetic, click-together stacking tray for tabletop gaming. (He says tabletop gaming, but we think these would be very handy in the shop, too.)\n[NeedItMakeIt] takes us through the process for both FDM 3D Printing in PLA, and CNC Machining the same part in walnut. Which part is nicer is absolutely a matter of taste; we cant imagine many wouldnt chose the wood, but\u00a0de gustibus non disputandum estthere is no accounting for taste. What there is accounting for is the materials and energy costs, which are both surprising that walnut is cheaper than PLA for this part is actually shocking, but the amount of power needed for dust collection is something that caught us off guard, too.\nOf course the process is the real key, and given that most of the video follows [NeedItMakeIt] crafting the CNCd version of his invention, the video gives a good rundown to any newbie just how much more work is involved in getting a machined part ready for sale compared to take it off the printer and glue in the magnets. (Its about 40 extra minutes, if you want to skip to the answer.) As you might expect, labour is by far the greatest cost in producing these items if you value your time, which [NeedItMakeIt] does in the spreadsheet he presents at the end.\nWhat he does not do is provide an answer, because in the case of this part, neither CNC or 3D Printing is better. Its a matter of taste which is the great thing about DIY. We can decide for ourselves which process and which end product we prefer. There is no accounting for taste, de gustibus non disputandum est, is true enough that its been repeated since Latin was a thing. Which would you rather, in this case? CNC or 3D print? Perhaps you would rather 3D Print a CNC? Or have one machine to do it all? Let us know in the comments for that sweet, sweet engagement.\nWhile youre engaging, maybe drop us a tip, while we offer our thanks to [Al] for this one.\n\n", "title": "- CNC\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u3079\u304d\u304b\uff1f", "body": "CNC\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3002\u7d20\u6750\u3084\u5de5\u7a0b\u306e\u9055\u3044\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304c\u826f\u3044\u304b\u306f\u597d\u307f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- CNC\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u3079\u304d\u304b\uff1f", "- CRATER\u5236\u4f5c\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068CNC\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u6750\u6599\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\uff01\u30af\u30eb\u30df\u6750\u3068PLA\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u5dee", "- CNC\u52a0\u5de5\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "- DIY\u7cbe\u795e\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff1a\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3092\u9078\u3076\uff1f"]}

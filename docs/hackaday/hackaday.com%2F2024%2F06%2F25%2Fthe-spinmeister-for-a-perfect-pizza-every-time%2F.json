Your domestic oven does a reasonable job, but doesnt really get hot enough. Even a specialist pizza oven such as [Yvo de Haas] Ooni doesnt quite do the best possible, so hes upgraded it with the SpinMeister  a system for precise timing of the heat, and controlled rotation of the cooking stone for an even result.\nThe spinning part is handled by a stepper motor, driving a hex shaft attached to the bottom of the stone through a chuck. The rotating bearing itself is from an aftermarket stone rotator kit. The controller meanwhile is a smart 3D printed unit with a vacuum-fluorescent display module, powered from an Arduino Nano. Theres a motor controller to handle driving the stepper, and an MP3 module for audible warning. Its all powered from a USB-C powerbank, for true portability. Hes produced a video showing it cooking a rather tasty-looking flatbread, which weve placed below. Now for some unaccountable reason, we want pizza.\nIf you recognize [Yvo]s name, then perhaps its because hes appeared on these pages a few times. Whether its a tentacle robot or something genuinely different in 3D printing, his work never ceases to be interesting.\n\n"}

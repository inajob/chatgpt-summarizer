Your domestic oven does a reasonable job, but doesnt really get hot enough. Even a specialist pizza oven such as [Yvo de Haas] Ooni doesnt quite do the best possible, so hes upgraded it with the SpinMeister  a system for precise timing of the heat, and controlled rotation of the cooking stone for an even result.\nThe spinning part is handled by a stepper motor, driving a hex shaft attached to the bottom of the stone through a chuck. The rotating bearing itself is from an aftermarket stone rotator kit. The controller meanwhile is a smart 3D printed unit with a vacuum-fluorescent display module, powered from an Arduino Nano. Theres a motor controller to handle driving the stepper, and an MP3 module for audible warning. Its all powered from a USB-C powerbank, for true portability. Hes produced a video showing it cooking a rather tasty-looking flatbread, which weve placed below. Now for some unaccountable reason, we want pizza.\nIf you recognize [Yvo]s name, then perhaps its because hes appeared on these pages a few times. Whether its a tentacle robot or something genuinely different in 3D printing, his work never ceases to be interesting.\n\n", "title": "\u77f3\u713c\u304d\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6539\u5584\uff01\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3067\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001[Yvo de Haas]\u304cOoni\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3001\u56de\u8ee2\u77f3\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3002\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ceNano\u304b\u3089\u7d66\u96fb\u3002USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u3002[Yvo]\u306f\u4ed6\u306b\u3082\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["\u77f3\u713c\u304d\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6539\u5584\uff01\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u77f3\u713c\u304d\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u52d5\u53ef\u80fd\uff01USB\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d4\u30b6\u713c\u304d\u5668", "Yvo de Haas\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u77f3\u713c\u304d\u30d4\u30b6\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u77f3\u713c\u304d\u30d4\u30b6\u713c\u6210\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

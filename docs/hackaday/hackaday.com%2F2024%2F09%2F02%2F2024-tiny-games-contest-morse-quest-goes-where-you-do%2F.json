Or are you maybe trying to learn so you can be an old school ham? Either way, you could have a lot of fun with [felix]s great little entry into the 2024 Tiny Games Contest  Morse Quest.\nThis minimalist text-based adventure game is played entirely in Morse code. That is, the story line, all the clues, and the challenges along the way are presented by a blinking LED. In turn, commands like LOOK, TAKE, and INVENTORY are entered with the slim key on the lower right side. A wee potentiometer allows the player to adjust the blink rate of the LED, so its fun for all experience levels. Of course, one could always keep a Morse chart handy.\nThe brains of this operation is an Arduino Nano, and theres really not much more to the BOM than that. It runs on a 9 V, so theoretically it could be taken anywhere you want to escape reality for a while. Be sure to check out the demo video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3067\u904a\u3076Arduino\u30df\u30cb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "body": "Morse code\u3067\u904a\u3076\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cMorse Quest\u300d\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002LED\u3067\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3001Arduino Nano\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u8981\u7d20\u306a\u304f9V\u3067\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u904a\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3067\u904a\u3076Arduino\u30df\u30cb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "2024\u5e74Tiny Games Contest\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\uff1a\u300cMorse Quest\u300d", "LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "Arduino Nano\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e2\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cMorse Quest\u300d"]}

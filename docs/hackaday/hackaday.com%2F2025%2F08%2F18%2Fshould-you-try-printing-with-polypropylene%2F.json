Given that this tough, slightly flexible thermoplastic has characteristics you might want for your prints, the question is: why? [Lost in Tech] is not answering that question in a recent video; instead hes showing us what were missing out on with a review of the material.\nA look at the Material Safety Data Sheet and available material has [Lost in Tech] suggesting it wont be (much) more toxic for you than PLA, but you still wouldnt want to huff the fumes. The biggest issue printing PP is getting it to stick  glass beds and PEI are not your friend, but polypropylene tape is easy to find and makes a fine print surface. He reviews a few other options, but it looks like plain old tape is still your best bet if you cant get a hold of a Prusa PP bed. The other big issue is shrinkage, but thats hardly unique to PP and can be accounted for in the model.\nJust because it can be used, that doesnt mean it should be. [Lost in Tech] does make a good case for why you might want to use PP  for one thing, it doesnt string much, in part because its not hygroscopic. That makes it great for those of us in humid climes who dont want to always faff around with dry boxes, but also wonderful for parts that will be in touch with water. Polypropylene also has great chemical resistance for even scarier chemicals than dihydrogen monoxide. The killer app though, at least as far as [Lost in Tech] is concerned, is to use polypropylene with compliant mechanisms: its incredibly resilient to bending, and doesnt fatigue easily. You might even call it a flexible filament, but unlike with TPU, you get a nice hard plastic to go with that flexibility.\nIf youre interested in this somewhat-forgotten filament, we featured a getting started guide last year. You can even make your own polypropylene filament using non-medical COVID masks, but do be sure to wash them first. What do you think? Is it time to give PP another chance, or has the 3D printing world moved on?\n"}

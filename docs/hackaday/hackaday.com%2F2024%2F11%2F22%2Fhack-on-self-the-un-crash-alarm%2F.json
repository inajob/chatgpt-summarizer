Its a seriously unpleasant in-between state  almost comfortable, but you know youre not really at rest, likely hungry, and even your phone battery is likely about to die. This kind of tiredness can get self-reinforcing real quick  especially if youre too tired to cook food, or youre stuck in an uncomfortable position. Its like the inverse of the marshmallow test  instead of a desire, youre dealing with lack thereof.\nIve been dealing with this problem a lot within the last two years time. Day to day, I could lose hours to this kind of tiredness. It gets worse when Im sick, and, its gotten worse on average after a few bouts of COVID. Its not just tiredness, either  distractability and tiredness go hand in hand, and they play into each other, too.\nMy conclusion, so far, was pretty simple. When Im tired, delayed but proper rest is way better than resting in a half-alert state, even if that takes effort I might not have yet. So, its important that I can get up, even if Im already in a crashed position. Sure, I could use tricks like do not sit down until Im ready to rest, but that only works sometimes  other times, the tiredness is too much to handle.\nAudio files and sound playback library in hand, negative reinforcement methods fresh in my mind, I went and cooked together a very simple solution.\nAnti-Crash Script\nWhen I noticed myself being tired and in a crash state, I would think oh, no worries, Im going to get up any minute now. Of course, it was never just a minute, and I decided to hook into that realization, subsurface but close enough that I could justify some intervention to myself.\nWould you be surprised if I told you the solution was to ring a siren into my headphones? The algorithm is simple  every time Im crashed and planning to get up real soon, I press a button that starts a five-minute timer, programmed to ring a siren into my headphones. When the seconds stop ticking and the siren triggers, I have a choice  get up and then re-trigger the alarm for five more minutes. There is no second choice, really  I dont give myself one. The part where I get up before turning the siren off is crucial, of course  though, in case of missing willpower, an accelerometer measuring activity could do as well.\nNot that much of my willpower would be required  turned out, it typically would be enough of a shock to realize just how quickly five minutes have passed. Consistently, every time I got tired, time would pass much quicker than I could feel it, and the oh damn its been five minutes already thought made for a surprisingly powerful reality check.\nInitially, the script was a tiny local webserver  I had some Flask examples fresh in my mental toolbox, so I took those and wrote two tiny HTML pages, crash and uncrash. The crash page received a seconds argument, indicating how many seconds to wait before ringing the alarm, and the uncrash page stopped the alarm. Keep the two webpages open, and hit Ctrl+R on the page I need  simple enough.\nResistance Is Counterproductive\nLater on, I beautified the pages a little  adding background colours, so that itd be easy for me to find the pages in my laptops window switcher and not get confused between them. That was my first attempt to make the crash/uncrash hooks more accessible  since, unsurprisingly, having to Alt-Tab a couple times before finding the right page required some mental energy, so I would often forget about them altogether, and developing a habit of using these pages was significantly harder. Thinking back to the very first article and principles I outlined in it  reducing resistance to use was a must.\nSo, the crash webpages got turned into keybinds accessible on my laptop globally. Surprisingly, despite the crash endpoints arbitrary integer delay, I didnt need much granularity. Right now, I only use three buttons , uncrash, crash in 300 seconds (5 minutes), and crash in 1 second (immediate). The immediate crash button was a surprisingly helpful one, too. See, the oh, five minutes truly can pass quicker than expected lesson has stuck with me  so, when Id notice myself crashing, I knew better than to waste time trusting in the just a few minutes notice.\nThe keybinds got me to use the script more often  which has helped me find more usecases, and use it even when Im not sick or super tired. Really, most of the trouble nowadays is noticing when I need to press the button  which, generally, is in the mornings, when I am still groggy and a scheduled appointment might not feel as important as it actually is.\nOne important aspect turned out to be retriggering the alarm instead of turning it off after five minutes. I get up either way, but usually, the crash doesnt  I might crash immediately afterwards, or a minute-two later. Stopping the alarm ended up being a very intentional crash is over decision  so, the stop button never got into my muscle memory. Ive indeed had muscle-memory cycle restarts, giving myself five more minutes without realizing  but Ive never had muscle-memory stops, which is nice, because stopping the script without even realizing it would be a critical failure condition.\nRetrospective: Its Great, Somehow\nAnything missing? Definitely! For one, there are some good keybinds I could add, even if maybe they wouldnt fundamentally impact how the script is functioning. Say Ive woken up, and I have to get somewhere early  so I use the crash script to get up and get with the gravity of my current situation. As I run around the house doing morning chores, five minutes pass and the alarm rings again, even though Im currently actively doing something around the house.\nNow, running back to the laptop and pressing a keybind isnt a problem. The problem is that I could be pressing the reset alarm button in two different states  either Im doing well, or Im not, but its the same button. Making two different buttons, one doing good and one still crashed, would help me collect metadata I could use for a good purpose  and, quite likely, add a trigger for some sort of positive reinforcement.\nOther than that? This script has eliminated yet another common failure mode from my life  and, once again, helped improve focus. Its as simple as simple goes, and, its gotten me to a more comfortable point  often, making a difference between an evening lost to tiredness, and an evening of recuperation.\nOne thing you might notice  to actually work properly, this script requires always-on, wireless headphones. In the next article, Ill talk about the wireless headphone device Ive built, why I had to build one instead of buying one, and how that device has helped me solved a bunch of other problems I didnt realize I had."}

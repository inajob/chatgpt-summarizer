This time, the subject is the MK4116  a 16 Kbit DRAM chip. Even without a calculator, you know thats a whopping 2 Kbytes, and while that doesnt sound impressive, in the late 1970s, it was a modern miracle.\nThe chip showed up in computers ranging from the TRS-80 to the Xerox Alto and was even a mainstay of arcade video games. While [Ken] thought it would be a pretty predictable teardown, he found several surprises.\nStatic RAM chips use flip flops and retain their state as long as power is on. Thats convenient, but each flip flop takes multiple transistors, so there is a limit to how many bits you can put on a particular size chip. Dynamic RAM increases that limit because it is nothing more than a capacitor and a single transistor. This increases memory density, but the problem is that the capacitor doesnt hold charge indefinitely. The computer or an associated circuit had to refresh the memory periodically to maintain the contents.\nOne of the key innovations for this chip was the use of multiplexed address lines so it could use a smaller package. Inside, two banks of capacitors store the bits, and, usually, a computer would use eight chips to store a byte. Of course, each memory bit is made to be as compact as possible. This chip is also made to be very low power when idle. The secret is that it doesnt use load transistors but instead uses an active pull-up tied to the system clock. Another interesting feature is the sense amplifier, which has to measure the tiny noisy voltage from the capacitors.\nYoull see all this and more in [Kens] write-up. Chips from that era were relatively easy to take apart compared to todays devices. Want to know how its done? [Ken] can tell you. He is well-known for doing a lot of cool stuff, with ICs and even old mainframe and space hardware.", "title": "\u300c1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "body": "MK4116\u306f16\u30ad\u30ed\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306eDRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u3059\u3002\u96fb\u6e90\u304c\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u9593\u306f\u72b6\u614b\u304c\u4fdd\u6301\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5145\u96fb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306f\u6c38\u4e45\u306b\u4fdd\u6301\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u306b\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u591a\u91cd\u5316\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u9818\u57df\u306b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u914d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u9ad8\u901f\u7a7a\u9593\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u5b66\u3076\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "\u300c\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u300d", "\u300c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u306a\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u6280\u8853\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u79d8\u7b56\u300d", "\u300c\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3082\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\uff01MK4116 16 Kbit DRAM\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u8feb\u308b\u300d"]}

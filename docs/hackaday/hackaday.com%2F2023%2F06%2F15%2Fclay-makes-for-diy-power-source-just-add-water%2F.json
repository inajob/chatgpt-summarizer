He couldnt take any of that clay home, but thats no problem  clay is plentiful, and apparently, you can make a battery with it. Well, perhaps not really a battery. Adding water to zeolite  a clay often used as a filter material  generates heat, and where theres heat, there can be electricity.\n[Robert] uses a salvaged Peltier device, as you find in small electric refrigerators. These solid-state heat pumps usually convert electricity into a temperature differential, but in this case, it is used as a thermocouple, generating electricity from a temperature difference.\nThe clay used is a very fine aluminosilicate crystal known as zeolite 13X. Once it comes into contact with plain ordinary water, it immediately starts to boil. Its a neat experiment, and with the Peltier underneath the metal container holding the clay, enough power is produced to spin a small motor. Of course this wont power anything large, but on the other hand, plenty of things these days dont take much power. This technique would work with any exothermic reaction of course, but theres something compelling about the shelf-stability of water and clay.\nBeats a potato, we suppose. Batteries dont have to be difficult to make. It is only hard to make really good ones.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u7c98\u571f\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u7c98\u571f\u306f\u71b1\u3092\u767a\u751f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6c34\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b\u3068\u71b1\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u3001\u767a\u96fb\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002zeolite\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u71b1\u6e90\u3068\u3057\u3066Peltier\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u767a\u96fb\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u99c6\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u4f4e\u51fa\u529b\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6c34\u3068\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u53cd\u5fdc\u7269\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u7c98\u571f\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u6c34\u3068\u683c\u95d8\u3059\u308b\u3001\u7c98\u571f\u3067\u529b\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u304f\u308b\u3001\u7c98\u571f\u306e\u71b1\u3068Peltier\u7d20\u5b50\u3067\u300d", "\u300c\u6c34\u3068\u7c98\u571f\u3067\u5c0f\u578b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u56de\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u7c98\u571f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u300d"]}

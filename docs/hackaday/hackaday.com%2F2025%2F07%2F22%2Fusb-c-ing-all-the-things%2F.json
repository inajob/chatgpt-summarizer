Plug mounted power supplies that turn mains voltage into low voltage DC on a barrel jack to power a piece of equipment. Weve all got a load of them for our various devices, most of us to the extent that it becomes annoying. [Mikeselectricstuff] has the solution, in the shape of a USB-C PD power supply designed to replace a barrel jack socket on a PCB.\nThe video below provides a comprehensive introduction to the topic before diving into the design. The chip in question is the CH224K, and he goes into detail on ordering the boards for yourself. As the design files are freely available, we wouldnt be surprised if they start turning up from the usual suppliers before too long.\nWe like this project and we can see that it would be useful, after all its easy to end up in wall wart hell. Weve remarked before that USB-C PD is a new technology done right, and this is the perfect demonstration of its potential.\n\n", "title": "- USB-C PD\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "body": "USB-C PD\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30d0\u30ec\u30eb\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- USB-C PD\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30d0\u30ec\u30eb\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- CH224K\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPCB\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "- \u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308bUSB-C PD\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

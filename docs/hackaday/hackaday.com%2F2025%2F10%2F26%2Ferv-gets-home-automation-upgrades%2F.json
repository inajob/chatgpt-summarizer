The few things that are still user-upgradable are getting fewer and farther between, but there are still a few things that can be modified and improved to our own liking like this control panel for a heat recovery ventilator (HRV).\nHRVs are systems that exchange fresh, outside air with stale, inside air while passing them both through a heat exchanger to keep from wasting energy. Many systems run continuously but they arent always needed, so some automation is beneficial. This upgrade from [vincentmakes] improves the default display for a Zehnder Comfoair Q350 HRV with a color display as well as adding it in to a home automation system, letting a user control fan speeds remotely as well as alerting the user when its time for filter replacements and providing up-to-date information from all the sensors in the HRV.\nThe project builds on a previous project which adapted an ESP32 to interact with the CAN bus used on these devices. With these upgrades the user can forgo the $300 proprietary upgrade that would be needed to get the same functionality otherwise. Its also fully open-source so all thats needed is to flash the firmware, replace the display, and enjoy the fresh air. Theres other modern HVAC equipment that can benefit from new controllers and a bit of automation as well.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01HRV\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u4f01\u696d\u306f\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u9032\u3081\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u3002HRV\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01HRV\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067HRV\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u63d0\u6848\u3092\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eHRV\u81ea\u4f5c\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u63db\u6c17\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5316\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fHRV\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u3059\u3059\u3081"]}

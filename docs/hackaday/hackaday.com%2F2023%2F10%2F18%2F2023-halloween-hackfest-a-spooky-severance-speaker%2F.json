After becoming fully engrossed in the sci-fi psycho-thriller Severance, [Ben Brooks] absolutely needed to have a version of the ominous speaker known as the Board.\nThis speaker represents the Board, who is the enigmatic governing body of Lumon Industries, the fictional and gigantic biotechnology company featured in the show.\nThe Board cultivates an air of mystery by rarely speaking, and when it does, it speaks through a single person who paraphrases the Boards responses. The audio that comes out is a mix of the shows theme song, pertinent show quotes, and static.\nThe guts of this freaky little thing are pretty simple  an ESP8266, a DF Player Mini, and a couple of small speakers. In fact, [Ben] had all the parts leftover from a previous home automation project, including the PCB.\nAlthough the original plan was to program it in Arduino, [Ben] ended up using ESPHome to make it easier to integrate with sensors for the big night. Be sure to check out the demo video after the break.\nWeve seen a few fun hacks for the porch this year, including the treat trough of terror and this Ouija robot that out-creeps the real thing.\n\n\n  \n\n"}

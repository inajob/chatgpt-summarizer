We generally assume that stuff will get wet and depending on the slope of the surface itll run off downhill at some point, probably in a nice, neat flow. Of course, reality doesnt work that way, as Swiss researchers recently found when they pointed high-speed cameras at simulated raindrops. Their findings were published recently in Applied Physical Sciences, which is sadly paywalled, but the summary article over at phys.org provides some details, including a video.\nThe researchers set up a 1.2 meter long dry silicate sand surface with a 30\u00b0 slope on which the drops were released. In the top image you can see two stills of the result, with the full video showing the drops turning into either peanut- or doughnut-shaped forms that gathered significant amounts of sand grains. These grains mix with the water, allowing a single drop to erode significant amounts of material from a slope, more than was previously assumed in existing soil erosion models.\nBeyond erosion, these findings also offer insights for similar dynamics in other fields, all thanks to a group of researchers who got curious during a rainy walk and decided to take a closer look.", "title": "\u96e8\u6ef4\u304c\u8868\u9762\u3067\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u65b0\u305f\u306a erosion\u73fe\u8c61", "body": "\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u96e8\u7c92\u306e\u843d\u4e0b\u3092\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u3001\u7802\u306e\u4fb5\u98df\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u96e8\u6ef4\u304c\u8868\u9762\u3067\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u65b0\u305f\u306a erosion\u73fe\u8c61", "\u9ad8\u901f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u6349\u3048\u305f\u96e8\u6ef4\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u52d5\u304d", "\u96e8\u304c\u571f\u58cc\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\u3059\u308b", "\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u96e8\u6ef4\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u884c\u52d5", "\u96e8\u3068\u571f\u58cc\u4fb5\u98df\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u767a\u898b\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

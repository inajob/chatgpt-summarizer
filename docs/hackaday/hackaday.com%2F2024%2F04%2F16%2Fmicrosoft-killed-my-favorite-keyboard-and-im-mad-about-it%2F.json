Too many in fact, to the point where it hurts my brain. To ease this burden, I choose my tools carefully to minimize obstructions as the words pour from my mind, spilling through my fingers on their way to the screen.\nThats a long-winded way of saying Im pretty persnickety about my keyboard. Now, Ive found out my favorite model has been discontinued, and Ill never again know the pleasure of typing on its delicate keys. And Im mad about it. Real mad. Because I shouldnt be in this position to begin with!\n\nTis Better To Have Loved And Lost\nI liked how the Sculpt design allowed my hands to lay naturally in line with my arms, with no splaying of the wrists.\nAfter some research and a little trial and error, I found a keyboard that worked for me. I detest rectangular keyboards that forced my wrists into splay inwards in an unnatural way. It gave me all kinds of problems approaching the realms of RSI and carpal tunnel and other ugly things.\nIn turn, I came to love the delicate curves of the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. Wireless, sleek, beguiling. With the keys laid out in delicate three-dimensional curves, the keyboard met my hands in their natural resting orientation, so perfectly I felt the keyboard had been made for me.\nNo more would my hands cramp and my wrists contort to find the keys. Instead, my fingers would simply dance a few millimeters, deftly finding the keys as I needed them. My typing was fast, clean, and my wrists barely moved an inch. They rested deftly in position ready to deliver. Oh, bliss.\nLoving this keyboard as I did, I forgave it when it faltered just 6 months into ownership. Dropped keys and dropped connections I could not withstand, but I had the salve at hand. Id kept the receipt like some paper-hoarding dragon, and returned to darken the door of the office supply once more. I suffered the side-eyes and probing questions and left with a new board fresh in box. Our love affair would continue as I racked up tens, hundreds of thousands of words with my new ally. We wrote together, we gamed together, we moved house together. We were building a life together. My plastic friend was helping me pay my bills. Nothing could stop us. The words flowed and the cash flowed in turn. Such is the life of a writer.\nThen came the break in.\nEvery computer I owned was stolen. Most of my guitars, too. Years of data, videos, photos, projects all gone when they carried my desktop out the door. They hadnt taken everything though. Theyd left behind my TV, my kettle, my toaster. Oh, and my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. Mouse, keyboard, and even the separate numeric keypad. It was all there, except\nWith the desktop, left the dongle. Sans the dongle, my friend was dead.\nIrreplaceable\nTalk to Logitech. Theyll sell you a keyboard, or a mouse, or fifteen of each. Swap them in and out as you like, you can pair them all to a single Unifying Receiver. Lose the dongle, and fear nothing. Just buy another one and re-pair your devices.\nMicrosoft couldnt find the time to implement this on the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. Fashionable engineers with houses with light fixtures more expensive than my car were too busy to think of the consequences this would have on me, so many years and miles far removed.\nI tried a mechanical keyboard, but the rectangular layout just wasnt for me. Neither were the switches, and I didnt fancy spending months trying to find what I liked.\nIn the wake of the robbery, I didnt have time to mourn or weep. To a writer, time is words and words are money. I needed money. I threw a cheap machine on my credit card and got back to work. Now lean on funds, I had to economize on a new keyboard. I couldnt afford another Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. I had to make do with a $30 keyboard and mouse combo made of cheaper plastic than most Coke bottles. My new instrument was cheap. The same 101 keys, but the music they played wasnt as sweet.\nI rankled at having to buy a replacement. I still had a perfectly good keyboard right here, why did I need to buy a new one when only the dongle was missing? But alas, these are the ways of the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop\u2014the mouse, the keyboard, and the numeric keypad. One dongle to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.\nAfter 18 months, I relented. I could go on no more. Words had to flow, faster than before. I couldnt rely on this cheap plastic from the store. I needed a better keyboard, my muse. I needed a faster way to pump out the news.\nBy now, the world had turned. The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop was done, dusted. Discontinued forever. Mine was useless without the original dongle, and remaining stock online was retailing for $800. Id have to move on.\nBetter, Somehow\nIts not as radical looking as the Microsoft design, but the fundamentals are there.\nThankfully, a blessed light shined from a local office store. Something akin to the glory of the Sculpt, but so slightly different. The Logitech Ergo K860 was designed with similar curves such that the keys meet the hand with a minimum of twist, with a supportive wrist pad to boot. It similarly had low-travel keys for a light, laptop-like typing experience. I tried it out and found it instantly familiar. My speed was up, mistakes down. My wrists once again enjoying the comfort courtesy of a quality keyboard.\nPerhaps the greatest joy of the Logitech design, though, is that it dispenses with the ridiculous notion of a dongle paired for life. Instead, its more than capable of being paired with any Logitech Unifying Receiver out there. I can pair a mouse and a keyboard to a single receiver, using a single USB port, and if I want to swap either out, I can do so freely. Theres no lock-in, and Im free to set up my desktop as I wish. If someone were to steal my computer again, I could simply buy a new dongle and keep on using my perfectly good keyboard the next day.\nThe Logitech has similarly magic curves.\nAs an engineer, I can perhaps understand why Microsoft didnt go this route. Logitech had to develop a piece of software for pairing its dongles and peripherals, which takes engineering time. That software needs to be written, tested, and likely maintained over time to ensure it stays compatible with todays ever-changing operating systems. Microsoft perhaps didnt see the point in doing so.\nAt the same time, this is what separates Logitech from Microsoft in this regard. One is a dedicated manufacturer of quality peripherals to the exclusion of all else. The other does build hardware, but as a secondary consideration, seldom achieving the same focus as its rivals.\nI still have my useless Microsoft Sculpt keyboard. DIY wired conversions exist. I wanna say that Ill do that one day, but for a use with a laptop, its kinda too messy. Plus I always kinda hated how the wrist rest always looked dirty. Nevermind.\nUltimately, Im happy that Logitech came through for me here. I needed a quality keyboard that fit me like a glove, and I have one once more. Plus, I dont have to worry about the loss of a tiny USB dongle making my $200 keyboard worthless. Thats a plus. Overall, Im about hardware thats robust and reusable, not fickle and fragile. Thats what matters to me.\n\n", "title": "Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop: \u4f7f\u3044\u5fc3\u5730\u304c\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304a\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u5ec3\u76e4\u3068\u306a\u308b", "body": "\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u611b\u597d\u8005\u304cMicrosoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop\u3092\u611b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u6e80\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u3068USB\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u7d1b\u5931\u3057\u3001\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3092\u63a2\u3059\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3002Logitech Ergo K860\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u3082\u624b\u9803\u3001\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3082\u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u826f\u3044\u9078\u629e\u3002", "titles": ["Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop: \u4f7f\u3044\u5fc3\u5730\u304c\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304a\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u5ec3\u76e4\u3068\u306a\u308b", "Logitech Ergo K860: \u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u304c\u81ea\u7136\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u554f\u984c: Logitech\u3068Microsoft\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9055\u3044", "\u8cea\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066: \u518d\u3073\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066", "\u58ca\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u604b: \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3078\u306e\u5225\u308c\u3068\u518d\u4f1a"]}

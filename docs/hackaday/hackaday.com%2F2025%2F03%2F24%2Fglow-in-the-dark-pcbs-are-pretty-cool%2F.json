Its a fun question, and one [Botmatrix] sought to answer when approached by manufacturer PCBWay to run a project together. It turns out that its quite possible to make glowing PCBs, with attractive results. (Video after the break.)\nSpecifically, PCBWay has developed a workable glow-in-the-dark silkscreen material that can be applied to printed circuit boards. As a commercial board house, PCBWay hasnt rushed to explain how precisely they pulled off this feat, but we dont imagine that it involved anything more than adding some glow-in-the-dark powder to their usual silkscreen ink, but we can only speculate.\nOn [Botmatrix]s end, his video steps through some neat testing of the performance of the boards. Theyre tested using sensors to determine how well they glow over time.\nIt might seem like a visual gimmick, and to an extent, its just a bit of fun. But still, [Botmatrix] notes that it could have some practical applications too. For example, glow-in-the-dark silkscreen could be used to highlight specific test points on a board or similar, which could be instantly revealed with the use of a UV flashlight. Its an edge case, but a compelling one. Its also likely to be very fun for creating visually reactive conference badges or in other applications where the PCB plays a major cosmetic role.\n[Botmatrix] says these are potentially the first commercially-available glow-in-the-dark printed PCBs. We love glow in the dark stuff; weve even explored how to make your own glowing material before, too. .\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

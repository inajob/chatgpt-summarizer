Its a fun question, and one [Botmatrix] sought to answer when approached by manufacturer PCBWay to run a project together. It turns out that its quite possible to make glowing PCBs, with attractive results. (Video after the break.)\nSpecifically, PCBWay has developed a workable glow-in-the-dark silkscreen material that can be applied to printed circuit boards. As a commercial board house, PCBWay hasnt rushed to explain how precisely they pulled off this feat, but we dont imagine that it involved anything more than adding some glow-in-the-dark powder to their usual silkscreen ink, but we can only speculate.\nOn [Botmatrix]s end, his video steps through some neat testing of the performance of the boards. Theyre tested using sensors to determine how well they glow over time.\nIt might seem like a visual gimmick, and to an extent, its just a bit of fun. But still, [Botmatrix] notes that it could have some practical applications too. For example, glow-in-the-dark silkscreen could be used to highlight specific test points on a board or similar, which could be instantly revealed with the use of a UV flashlight. Its an edge case, but a compelling one. Its also likely to be very fun for creating visually reactive conference badges or in other applications where the PCB plays a major cosmetic role.\n[Botmatrix] says these are potentially the first commercially-available glow-in-the-dark printed PCBs. We love glow in the dark stuff; weve even explored how to make your own glowing material before, too. .\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u6697\u95c7\u3067\u5149\u308b\u57fa\u677f\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "PCBWay\u304c\u767a\u5149\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3044\u5fdc\u7528\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6697\u95c7\u3067\u5149\u308b\u57fa\u677f\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- PCBWay\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u5149\u308b\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3", "- \u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5149\u308bPCB\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u5fdc\u7528\u3082\uff1f\u5149\u308b\u57fa\u677f\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u521d\u306e\u5546\u696d\u5411\u3051\u5149\u308bPCB\u306e\u767b\u5834"]}

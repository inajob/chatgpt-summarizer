One device in particular, the HP TouchPad, was released just a month before webOS went under and is still a favorite among hackers  giving the device the kind of love that HP never could. [Alan Morford] from the pivotCE blog shares the kind of hack that helps this device exist in a modern-day world: a USB-C upgrade for charging and data transfer.\nThe inline micro USB port used is a perfect fit for a USB-C upgrade, with only small amounts of PCB and case cutting required. Just make sure to get a breakout that has the appropriate 5.1 K resistors onboard, and follow [Alan]s tutorial closely. He shows all the points you need to tap to let your TouchPad charge and transfer data to your computer, whether for firmware flashing or for daily use.\nThis hack doesnt preserve the USB-OTG feature, but thats fixable with a single WUSB3801. Apart from that, this mod is perfect for keeping your webOS tablet alive and kicking in todays increasingly USB-C dominated world. Once youve done it, you might want to take care of your PlayStation 4 controllers and Arduino Uno boards, too."}

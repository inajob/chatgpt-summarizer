Its a human right all too often denied to renters the world over. Regardless, five years later, when youre doing the mandatory minimalist remodel, youll be ruing the day you put in all those wall anchors. At that point, consider removing them with this nifty tool from [XDIY with Itzik].\nThe design aims to remove wall anchors as cleanly as possible. Its easiest to watch the video to get the idea of how it works.\nThe tool features a block which holds a bearing. That bearing acts as a rotating stop for a wood screw. The idea is that you place the block against the wall, and use a power drill to drive a wood screw into the anchor at high speed. The screw cant move forward, so the threads basically yank the plug out of the wall, and relatively neatly at that. Once removed, theres a little push stopper you can use to hold the old plug in place as you remove the wood screw from the device, ready to go again.\n[Itzik] demonstrates the device by removing ten wall plugs in just 40 seconds. If youve got a lot to do, or its a job you do regularly, you might like to have this tool in your kit.\nOftentimes, having the right tool can make a job ten times faster, and this seems like one of those cases. Video after the break.\n\n"}

In the case of [Spencer Owen], who you may know as the creator of the RC2014 retrocomputing ecosystem, it was appropriate to have one of the little machines at work somewhere, so [peahen] did just that. The result is a cake in the shape of an IMSAI 8080 microcomputer, but it does more than just look the part. This is a working replica of the classic machine, powered as you might expect by an RC2014 sitting next to it.\nThe lights are a set of addressable LEDs, and the switches are made from appropriately colored sweets. Sadly the plan to make these capacitive touch switched failed as the wiring became buried in the icing, but the LEDs deserve a second look. Theyre encased in translucent heatshrink sleeving which is embedded under a layer of white icing, which is translucent enough, but on top for the classic panel light look are a set of edible cake-makers jewels. Best of all while all except the electronics is edible, the front panel is robust enough to have been removed from the cake in one and thus will live on.\nWe rather like the idea of electronics meeting sugarcraft, because fondant is a surprisingly versatile medium that deserves attention much further than just confectionery. We remember it being a popular cheap way to experiment with 3D printing back at the dawn of open source printers, and it still has some potential. Meanwhile if youve not seen the RC2014 we reviewed its original version back in 2016, and since then its evolved to become an ecosystem in its own right.", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "body": "\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u304cIMSIA 8080\u578b\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001LED\u3084\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- IMSAI 8080\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u578b\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- RC2014\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u98df\u7528\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u63a2\u6c42"]}

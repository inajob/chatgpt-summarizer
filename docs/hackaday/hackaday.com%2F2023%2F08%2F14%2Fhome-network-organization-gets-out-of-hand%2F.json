He has written about individual components before, but this blog post brings it all together and reviews the entire system. The networking gear is installed in a closet and mounted in a 25U tall 19-inch rack. From top to bottom, here is a brief list of the gear:\nFull View of Network Equipment Rack\n\nKeystone patch panels\npfSense Firewall / Router\nTwo Cisco Ethernet switches\nRedundant internet connections\nShelf of numerous servers\nRAID-Z2, 12 each 8 TB SCSI, media storage\nNAS RAID, 6 ea 4 TB SAS, 2 ea 800 GB SSD\nVideo Management System, 48 TB storage\nUPS and power distribution units\n\nMost of the Ethernet uses 10GBASE-T and Cat6 cabling and connectors, with some interconnects use fiber optical cable and LC connectors. Unsurprisingly, as this setup grew and grew, [spooky] had to pipe in air-conditioning to the closet.\nThis is a serious installation, but there are plenty of good ideas for folks with less ambitious networking goals and/or requirements. We liked the swappable Keystone jacks in the patch panels, and the cable pass-through panel with a dense curtain of rubber fringe to keep things looking tidy. If you have any ideas to share on network equipment and cable management, let us know in the comments."}

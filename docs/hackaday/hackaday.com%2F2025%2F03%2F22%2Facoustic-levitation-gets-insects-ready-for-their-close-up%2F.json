Its a neat trick, the sort of thing that drives them wild at science fairs, but as the technique only works on exceptionally small and light objects it would seem to have little practical use.\nThat is, unless, you happen to be interested in exceptionally small and light objects. A paper titled Automated Photogrammetric Close-Range Imaging System for Small Invertebrates Using Acoustic Levitation describes a fascinating device which allows the researchers to image insects in whats essentially a weightless environment.\nWith the delicate specimens suspended in front of the lens, theres no background to worry about and they can be perfectly lit from all angles. Whats more, with careful control of the ultrasonic transducers, its possible to control the rotation of the target  allowing researchers to produce 3D scans of the insects using just one camera.\nThere isnt a whole lot of technical detail on the device itself, other than the fact that spherical chamber has a radius of 60 mm and is fitted with 96 Murata MA40S4R/S transducers operating at 40 kHz. The paper notes that early attempts to control the transducer array with a Arduino Mega failed, and that the team had to switch over to a FPGA. With their current signal generator stage, the researchers are able to rotate the specimen by 5\u00b0 angles.\nInterested in learning more about acoustic levitation?

Although perhaps obsolete by todays standards, this 15 to 60 second long broadcast at 13:00 Eastern Time every single day has been a constant in the life of Canadians, whether they tuned into local radio, or (increasingly) via Internet radio.\nThe NRC Time Signal consisted out of a series of 800 Hz sinewave beeps followed by a second-long signal to indicate the top of the hour. Back in the day this was extremely useful to sync ones clocks, watches and other time-keeping devices to. Yet between the transmission delays caused by Internet radio and the increased availability of NTP and other time sources on modern-day devices, the signals main use appears to have become a nostalgic reminder of what once was a constant of each and every day.\nIn this regard the public response to the rather unceremonious decommissioning without prior announcement was rather predictable. After all, even if it wasnt that useful, why throw out something that is more recognizable than any other radio jingle for generations of Canadians?\nTop image: National Research Council\u00a0laboratories in\u00a0Ottawa."}

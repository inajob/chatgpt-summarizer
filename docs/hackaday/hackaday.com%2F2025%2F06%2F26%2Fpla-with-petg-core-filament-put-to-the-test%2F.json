(Credit: My Tech Fun, YouTube)\nSometimes you see an FDM filament pop up that makes you do a triple-take because it doesnt seem to make a lot of sense. This is the case with a hybrid PLA/PETG filament by Stronghero 3D\u00a0 that features a PETG core. This filament also intrigued [Dr. Igor Gaspar] who imported a spool from the US to have a poke at it to see why youd want to combine these two filament materials.\nAccording to the manufacturer, the PLA outside makes up 60% of the filament, with the rest being the PETG core. The PLA is supposed to shield the PETG from moisture, while adding more strength and weather resistance to the PLA after printing. Another interesting aspect is the multi-color look that this creates, and which [Igor]s prints totally show. Finding the right temperatures for the bed and extruder was a challenge and took multiple tries with the Bambu Lab P1P including bed adhesion troubles.\nAs for the actual properties of this filament, the layer adhesion test showed it to be significantly worse than plain PLA or PETG when printed at extruder temperatures from 225 \u00b0C to 245 \u00b0C. When the shear stress is put on the material instead of the layer adhesion, the results are much better, while torque resistance is better than plain PETG. This is a pattern that repeats across impact and other tests, with PETG more brittle. Thermal deformation\u00a0 temperature is, unsurprisingly, between both materials, making this filament mostly a curiosity unless its properties work much better for your use case than a non-hybrid filament.\n\n", "title": "- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8G\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9PLA/PETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u767a\u898b", "body": "Stronghero 3D\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9PLA/PETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u5f37\u5ea6\u3084\u8010\u5019\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u72d9\u3046\u304c\u7279\u6027\u306fPLA\u5358\u4f53\u3088\u308a\u52a3\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8G\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9PLA/PETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u767a\u898b", "- \u5f37\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305fPLA/PETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3068\u7528\u9014", "- \u8907\u6570\u306e\u8272\u5408\u3044\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308bStronghero 3D\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6311\u6226\u3068\u6e29\u5ea6\u8a2d\u5b9a", "- PLA\u3068PETG\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3001\u771f\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

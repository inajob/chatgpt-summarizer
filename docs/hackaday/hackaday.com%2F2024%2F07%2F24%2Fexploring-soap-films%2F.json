You can make your own with some PVC pipe, some 3D-printed attachments, a speaker, and a few other odds and ends.\nIf your PVC pipe doesnt match [DaniloR29s] exactly, no problem. The files are in OpenSCAD so you can easily change them to suit your needs. One end of the PVC tee dips into soap solution to form a film  think like a soap bubble before you blow it out of the bubble wand. The other ends have the speaker and the cell phone camera.\n\nWhile the effect is entertaining, theres real science behind it. You can learn about acoustic propagation, interference, and diphasic patterns, among other things. This would be a fun classroom project or just something to pass the time on a rainy afternoon. Be careful, though. Taking these kinds of pictures can be addictive. If youd rather make bubbles, why not make giant ones?\nIf you enjoy this sort of thing, [Danilo] also built the KaleidoPhoneScope, which you can see in action in the video below.\n"}

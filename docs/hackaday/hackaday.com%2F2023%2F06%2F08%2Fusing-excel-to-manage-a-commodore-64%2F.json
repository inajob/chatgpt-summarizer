As fewer and fewer people recognize what this icon represents, a challenge is growing for retrocomputing enthusiasts that rely on floppy disk technology to load any programs into their machines. For some older computers that often didnt have hard disk drives at all, like the Commodore 64, its one of the few ways to load programs into computer memory. And, rather than maintaining an enormous collection of floppy discs, [RaspberryPioneer] built a way to load programs on a Commodore using Microsoft Excel instead.\nThe Excel sheet that manages this task uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an event-driven programming language built into Office, to handle the library of applications for the Commodore (or Commodore-compatible clone) including D64, PRG, and T64 files. This also includes details about the software including original cover art and any notes the user needs to make about them. Using VBA, it also communicates to an attached Arduino, which is itself programmed to act as a disk drive for the Commodore. The neceessary configuration needed to interface with the Arduino is handled within the spreadsheet as well. Some additional hardware is needed to interface the Arduino to the Commodores communications port but as long as the Arduino is a 5V version and not a 3.3V one, this is fairly straightforward and the code for it can be found on its GitHub project page.\nWith all of that built right into Excel, and with an Arduino acting as the hard drive, this is one of the easiest ways weve seen to manage a large software library for a retrocomputer like the Commodore 64. Of course, emulating disk drives for older machines is not uncommon, but we like that this one can be much more dynamic and simplifies the transfer of files from a modern computer to a functionally obsolete one. One of the things we like about builds like this, or this custom Game Boy cartridge, is how easy it can be to get huge amounts of storage that the original users of these machines could have only dreamed of in their time.", "title": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6642\u4ee3\u9045\u308c\uff1fRaspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64", "body": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u304c\u3082\u304610\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u524d\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u306b\u3082\u304b\u304b\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u4fdd\u5b58\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306f\u307e\u3060\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u306f\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306b\u983c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u4f55\u3092\u8868\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u6c17\u4ed8\u304b\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Microsoft Excel\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001Commodore 64\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002Excel\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306fVBA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Commodore\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3092\u6271\u3044\u3001\u6dfb\u4ed8\u306eArduino\u3068\u901a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u3002Excel\u306b\u3059\u3079\u3066\u304c\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7ba1\u7406\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6642\u4ee3\u9045\u308c\uff1fRaspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64", "\u4eca\u3082\u306a\u304a\u73fe\u5f79\uff01\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u5fc5\u9808\u306e\u300c\u4fdd\u5b58\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u300d\u306b\u8fbc\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u73fe\u5728", "PRG\u3001T64\u3001D64\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092Excel\u3067\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01", "Raspberry Pi x Arduino\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7570\u8272\u306e\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300c\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u300d", "\u30ea\u30bf\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3078\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u8ee2\u9001\u306e\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u305d\u3053\u306b\u306fExcel\u3068VBA\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\uff01"]}

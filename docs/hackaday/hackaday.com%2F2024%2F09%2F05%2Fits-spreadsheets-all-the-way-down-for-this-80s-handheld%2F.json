There were all kinds of different, incompatible operating systems, hardware, and programs, all competing against one another, and with essentially no networking to tie everything together. Some of these products were incredibly niche as well, only running one program or having a limited use case to keep costs down. Such was the Convergent WorkSlate, a computer that ran only a spreadsheet with any programs also needing to be built into a spreadsheet.\nUpon booting the device, the user is presented with a fairly recognizable blank spreadsheet, albeit with a now-dated LCD display (lacking a backlight) and a bespoke keyboard and cursor that wouldnt have allowed for easy touch typing. The spreadsheet itself is quite usable though, complete with formatting tools and the capability to use formulas like a modern spreadsheet program would. It also hosted a tape deck for audio and data storage, a modem for communicating with other devices, and an optional plotter-style printer. The modem port is how [Old VCR] eventually interfaces with the machine, although as one can imagine is quite a task for a piece of small-batch technology from the 80s like this. After learning how to send and receive information, a small game is programmed into the machine and then a Gopher interface is built to give the device limited Internet connectivity.\nThe investigation that [Old VCR] goes into on this project to get this obsolete yet unique piece of hardware running and programmed to do other tasks is impressive, and worth taking a look at especially because spreadsheets like this arent Turing-complete, leading to a few interesting phenomenon that most of us wouldnt come across in the modern computing world. Since only around 60,000 units were ever made its difficult to come across these machines, but if you want to take a look at the spreadsheet world of the 80s without original hardware you can still run Lotus 1-2-3 natively in Linux today.\nThanks to [Cameron] for the tip!", "title": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u5c02\u7528\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cConvergent WorkSlate\u300d", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u6df7\u4e71\u3057\u3001\u4e0d\u7d71\u4e00\u306aOS\u3084\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u304c\u7af6\u5408\u3002Convergent WorkSlate\u306f\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u307f\u3067\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u30ab\u30fc\u30bd\u30eb\u3002\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3084\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u3053\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u4e8b\u60c5\u3092\u77e5\u308b\u4e0a\u3067\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u5c02\u7528\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cConvergent WorkSlate\u300d", "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\uff1a\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u300cConvergent WorkSlate\u300d\uff1a\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u4f53\u9a13", "\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u300cConvergent WorkSlate\u300d\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u3053\u3068", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u300cConvergent WorkSlate\u300d\uff1a\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

This led to diving down a bit of a rabbit hole about excitable mediums, ultimately leading him to optimize the shapes and come up with some pretty wild variations which he shows off in a video (also embedded below.)\nAfter figuring out that the moving flame depended on combustion of fuel vapor in an environment that didnt allow for the whole surface to stay lit at once, [Steve] tried to optimize the design of 3d-printed channels and raceways to encourage this effect, and he came up with some pretty novel ones. The 3D models are here if youd like to try them for yourself (we especially like the figure eight and rays models.)\nThe video is an excellent show  tell of everything [Steve] dove into, complete with plenty of demonstrations of harnessing this effect to create some nifty running flames. Check it out in the video below, and if unintuitive physical effects are your thing, dont miss [Steve]s peeling apart of the turntable paradox.\n\n"}

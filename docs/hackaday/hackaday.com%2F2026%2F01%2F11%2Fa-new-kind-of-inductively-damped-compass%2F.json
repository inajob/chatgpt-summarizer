The water in such a configuration not only lets the needle spin without friction, but also dampens out (so to speak) the needle\u2019s tendency to swing back and forth across the north-south line. Liquid-filled compasses use the same principle, but even well-made compasses can develop bubbles when exposed to temperature or pressure variations. Rather than accept this unsightly state of affairs, [The Map Reading Company] designed a new kind of liquid-free, inductively-damped compass.\nIt\u2019s hard to design a compass that settles quickly, even if it uses a strong magnet, because the Earth\u2019s own magnetic field is just so weak, and the stronger the internal magnet is, the more likely it is to be thrown off by nearby magnetic objects. As a result, they tend to swing, overshoot, and oscillate around their final orientation for some time. Most compasses use liquid to damp this, but a few, mostly military compasses, use a conductive baseplate instead: as the magnet moves, it induces eddy currents in the baseplate, which create a weak magnetic field opposing its motion, slowing the magnet down. Inductively-damped compasses don\u2019t get bubbles, but they don\u2019t let you see a map through the baseplate. [The Map Reading Company] dealt with this by making the baseplate transparent and surrounding the compass needle with a ring of high-conductivity copper alloy. This gave him a clear baseplate compass for easy map reading which would never develop bubbles. It\u2019s a simple hack, and should be easy to replicate, but it still seems to be a new design. In fact, [The Map Reading Company] is releasing\u00a0most of the design to the public domain. Anyone can build this design.\nIf this prompts your interest in compasses, check out the Earth inductor compass. We\u2019ve also seen a visualization of the eddy currents that damp these oscillations, and even seen them used to drive a bike.\n\nThanks to [Mel] for the tip!"}

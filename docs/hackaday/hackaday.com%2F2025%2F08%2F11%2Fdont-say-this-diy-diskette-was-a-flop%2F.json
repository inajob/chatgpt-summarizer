Sometimes, you do it just to see if you can. This project is in category two: [polymatt] didnt need to create a floppy disk from scratch- plenty of old disks still exist but were glad he made the attempt because it makes for a fascinating video thats embedded below.\nSome of you are going to quibble with the terminology [polymatt] uses in this video: first of all, he didnt begin by creating the universe, so is he really starting from scratch? Secondly, the floppy format hes attempting to copy is a 3\u00bd diskette, which does not flop at all. Alas, the vernacular has decided that stiffy means something totally different that you ought not to hand a co-worker, and floppy is the word in use now.\nChoosing newer stiff-walled medium does allow him to practice his CNC skills and make the coolest-looking floppy enclosure weve ever seen. (It turns out brushed aluminum is even cooler-looking than the translucent neon ones.) On the other hand, we cant help but wonder if a lower-density format 5\u00bc disk might have been an easier hurdle to jump. The diskette that was built does magnetize, but it cant read or write actual files. We wonder if the older format might have been more forgiving of grain size and composition of his ferrite coating. Even more forgiving still would be to use these techniques to\u00a0make magnetic tape \u00a0which is a perfectly viable way to store data.\nInstead of storing data, you could make your own cleaning floppy. Its not like data storage was really the point here, anyway its not the destination, but the journey. So whatever you call this DIY diskette, please dont call it a flop.\nThanks to [Anonymous] for the stiff tip! If you want to slip us your tip, rest assured we will grab on and milk it for all it is worth to our readers.\n\n"}

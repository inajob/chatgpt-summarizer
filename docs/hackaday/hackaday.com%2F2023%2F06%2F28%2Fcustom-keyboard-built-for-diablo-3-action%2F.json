Theyre also perfect when you need to optimize your setup for a certain game or piece of software. [Pakequis] did just that with his Bad Thing of the Edge mechanical keyboard build.\n[Pakequis] occasionally plays Diablo 3 on a tiny 7-inch laptop, which as you might expect, doesnt have a keyboard conducive to gaming. Thus, he designed a mechanical keyboard with a series of important actions mapped to keys for the left hand. Naturally, that was an opportunity to have fun with the keycaps, which all feature graphics for their relevant in-game functions. The prototype was built with surplus keys from an old PTZ camera controller, but the final version runs Cherry MX switches. There are also a set of RGB LEDs with a variety of fun effects. The whole thing is run by a Raspberry Pi Pico, which is perfectly suited for building custom USB HID devices.\nHackers build custom keyboards for all kinds of reasons, like ergonomics, style, or just sheer absurdist fun.\n\n", "title": "\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30d6\u30ed3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u4f7f\u7528\u3002Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3002\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u306f\u5e83\u304c\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30d6\u30ed3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30df\u30cb\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306ePC\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u53e4\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0USB HID\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

So why not make your own? Sure, you could assemble one from a kit, but why not take a cheap mechanical keyboard, slice it in half and just waves hands connect the two halves back together? If this thought appeals to you, then [nomolk]s literal hackjob video should not be ignored. Make sure to enable English subtitles for the Japanese-language video.\nEasy split keyboard tip: just reconnect both halves (Credit: nomolk, YouTube)\nIn it, the fancy (but cheap) mechanical keyboard with Full RGB functionality is purchased and tested prior to meeting its demise. Although the left side with the cable and controller still works, the right side now needs to be connected, which is where a lot of tedious wires have to be soldered to repair traces.\nNaturally this will go wrong, so its important to take a (sushi) break and admire the sunset before hurling oneself at the tracing of faulty wiring. This process and the keyboard matrix is further detailed on the blog entry (in Japanese) for this process.\nAlthough this was perhaps easier than the other split keyboard project involving a membrane keyboard, this tongue-in-cheek project demonstrates the limits of practicality with this approach even if it could be cleaned up more with fancier wiring.\nWe give it full points for going the whole way, however, and making the keyboard work again in the end.\n\n"}

Specifically, he wanted a Clockwork Pi uConsole, but didnt want to wait three months for it. There are plenty of DIY options, but many of them are difficult to build. So [Sam] did the logical thing: he designed his own. The Bumble Berry Pi is the result.\nThe design criteria? A tactile keyboard was a big item. Small enough to fit in a pants pocket, but big enough to be useful. Whats more is he wanted to recycle some old Pi 3Bs instead of buying new hardware.\n\nThe result looks good. Theres a 4.3 touch screen, a nice keyboard, and enough battery to run all day. If you already have the Pi, you are looking at about $60 and two 3D-printed parts. There is some soldering, but nothing that should put off the average Hackaday reader.\nDoes it run Doom? From the photo on the GitHub repo, yes, yes, it does. This would be a fun build, although we have to admit, the beauty of doing a build like this is making it your own. Maybe your pants have differently shaped pockets, we dont know.\nEither way, though, you can get some ideas from [Sam] or just clone his already good-looking deck. If were being honest, we are addicted to multiple screens. Plus, we want a built-in radio."}

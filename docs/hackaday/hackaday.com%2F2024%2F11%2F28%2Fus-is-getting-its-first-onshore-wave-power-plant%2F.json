One type of renewable that doesnt see a lot of love, despite 80% of the world\u2019s population living within 100 km (~60 mi) of a coastline, is harnessing the energy of the tides. [via Electrek]\nThe U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wave energy has the potential to generate over 1,400 terawatt-hours per year, so while this initial project wont be huge, the overall possible power generation from tidal power is nothing to sneeze at. Known more for its role in shipping fossil fuels, the Port of Los Angeles will host the new wave power pilot being built by Eco Wave Power and Shell. Eco Waves system uses floaters to drive pistons that compress hydraulic fluid and turn a generator before the decompressed fluid is returned to the pistons in a nice, tidy loop.\nEco Wave plans to finish construction by early 2025 and already has the power conversion unit onsite at the Port of Los Angeles. While the press release is mum on the planned install capacity, Eco Wave claims they will soon have 404.7 MW of installed capacity through several different pilot projects around the world.\nWe covered another Swiss company trying to harness tidal power with underwater kites, and if wave power isnt your thing but you still like mixing water and electricity, why not try offshore wind or a floating solar farm?

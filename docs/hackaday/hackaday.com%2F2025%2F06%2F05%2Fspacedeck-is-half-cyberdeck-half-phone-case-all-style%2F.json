Is The Hitchikers Guide to The Galaxy available on the Playstore? Well, the e-book of the novel surely is, and having access to Wikipedia comes close. The design is building off (or out from, as the case may be) a 3D-printed phone case for the S24 by Digital Proto.\nGiven that the Galaxy S24 has more horsepower than the ancient Macbook were writing this on, this setup is probably going to be more useful than you might think, especially when paired with Termux to give you the full power of Linux.\nLike some modern laptops, the screen can rotate 180 degrees for when the keyboard isnt needed. The case will also allow for Nintendo Switch2 joycon integration, but thats a work in progress for now. The connection points will also be modular so other accessories can be used. All files will be released once [Sp4m] is happy with how the Joycons are holding on, hopefully with a license that will allow us to remix this for other phones.\nGiven the supercomputers in our pockets, its really a wonder we dont see more android-based cyberdecks, but most seem to stick to SBCs. Lately it seems the slabtop form-factor has been equally popular for cyberdecks, but its hard to beat a clamshell for practicality."}

For example, [vimpo] decided to get one running a minimal Minecraft server.\nThe Bl602-equipped board inside the LED lightbulb. (Credit: vimpo, YouTube)\nInside the target bulb is a BL602 MCU by Bouffalo Lab, that features not only a radio supporting 2.4 GHz WiFi and BLE 5, but also a single-core RISC-V CPU that runs at 192 MHz and is equipped with 276 kB of RAM and 128 kB flash.\nThis was plenty of space for the minimalist Minecraft server [vimpo] wrote several years ago. The project says it was designed for machines with limited resources, but youve still got to wonder if they ever thought it would end up running on a literal lightbulb at some point.\nIt should be noted, of course, that this is not the full Minecraft server, and it should only be used for smaller games like the demonstrated TNT run mini game.\nPerhaps the next challenge will be to combine a large set of these light bulbs into a distributed computing cluster and run a full-fat Minecraft server? It seems like a waste to leave the BL602s and Espressif MCUs that are in these IoT devices condemned to a life of merely turning the lights on or off when we could have them do so much more.\n\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u7403\u5185\u306eBL602\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u30df\u30cbMinecraft\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "WiFi\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u96fb\u7403\u306bMinecraft\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u7403\u5185\u306eBL602\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u30df\u30cbMinecraft\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9", "- WiFi\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u96fb\u7403\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u52d5\u304fMinecraft\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u96fb\u7403\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5206\u6563\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- IoT\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff01\u96fb\u7403\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc"]}

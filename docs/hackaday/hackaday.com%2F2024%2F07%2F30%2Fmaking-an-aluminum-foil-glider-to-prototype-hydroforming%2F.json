While trying to think of ways to create a hydroformed airplane without spending big bucks on having it done professionally  or learning to weld sheet metal together with waterproof welds along the seams  [Adrian Perez] decided that using plain aluminium foil as found in the average kitchen might be a good way to get his feet wet here. When stuck together with double-sided tape, the foil is both strong and light enough to be inflated like a party balloon and still fly better than a lead balloon (which do fly, albeit poorly).\nThe basic design for the initial Luma glider that he assembled is based around a Kline-Fogleman (KA) airfoil. This type of airfoil is mostly characterized by the simplicity of construction, having been devised in the 1960s for paper airplanes. It uses a stepped approach rather than a continuous airfoil and has seen mostly attention in hobby circles. Even if this Luma glider brings to mind the ill-fated Goodyear Inflatoplane, a hydroformed version of these foil prototype gliders would not have to rely on being inflated to function.\nFor small-scale prototypes, using low-cost aluminium foil or similar to test out shapes before committing to a design to be welded and hydroformed does seem like a useful approach.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7b94\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u3084\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30ec\u30b9\u92fc\u306a\u3069\u306e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u306b\u3059\u308b\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u6c34\u5727\u6210\u5f62\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30a2\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30da\u30ec\u30b9\u6c0f\u306f\u3001\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30db\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u306f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u4e0a\u3067\u6709\u7528\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7b94\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "Kline-Fogleman (KA)\u7ffc\u578b\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u521d\u671f\u578b\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7b94\u88fd\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7b94\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e88\u5099\u8a66\u9a13"]}

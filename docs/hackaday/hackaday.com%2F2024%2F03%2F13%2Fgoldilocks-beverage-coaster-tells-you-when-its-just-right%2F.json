Wherever [gokux] is, they may be experiencing actual winter this year, given that they are out there getting cozy with a hot cup of what-have-you. But how do they know its at the right temperature for drinking? Enter the temperature-monitoring smart coaster.\nAt the heart of this build is a GY-906 infrared temperature sensor, which senses the warmth (or lack thereof) and displays the degrees on a small OLED screen thanks to a Seeed Xiao SAMD21. To make things simple, there is also an ideogram that corresponds to the current temperature  snowflake for too cold, danger sign for too hot, and thumbs up for that just-right range. Although this coaster is mostly 3D-printed, the mug sits on a slotted piece of aluminium that is removable for easy cleaning. This would be a good-looking and useful addition to any desk.\nThis is isnt the first temperature-indicating beverage coaster weve seen. The most recent one ultimately used a probe, which is likely about as accurate (and messy) as you can get with these things.", "title": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc: \u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3084\u304a\u8336\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af", "body": "\u671d\u306f\u6e29\u304b\u3044\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30f3\u98f2\u6599\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u552f\u4e00\u306e\u8a00\u3044\u8a33\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u304c\u3069\u3046\u3067\u3082\u3088\u304f\u3001\u3069\u3053\u306b\u3044\u3066\u3082[Gokux]\u306f\u3001\u6e29\u304b\u3044\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5c45\u5fc3\u5730\u3088\u3055\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u6e29\u5ea6\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc: \u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3084\u304a\u8336\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af", "GY-906\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u6e29\u5ea6\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u8868\u793a: \u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u7528\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u6e29\u5ea6\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc: \u304a\u3057\u3083\u308c\u306a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0", "\u6e29\u5ea6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u7528\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8"]}

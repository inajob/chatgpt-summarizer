Well before the modern neural network revolution, though, there was an earlier tool in this same vein. [harke] tells us all about Microsoft Music Producer 1.0, a forgotten relic from the 1990s.\nThe software wasnt ever marketed openly. Instead, it was a part of Microsoft Visual InterDev, a web development package from 1997. It allowed the user to select a style, a personality, and a band to play the song, along with details like key, tempo, and the shape of the composition. It would then go ahead and algorithmically generate the music using MIDI instruments and in-built synthesized sounds.\nAs [harke] demonstrates, there are a huge amounts of genres to choose from. Pick one, and youll most likely find it sounds nothing like the contemporary genre its supposed to be recreating. The more gamey genres, though, like Adventure or Chase actually sound pretty okay. The moods are hilariously specific, too \u2014 you can have a noble song, or a striving or serious one. [harke] also demonstrates building a full song with the 7AM Illusion preset, exporting the MIDI, and then adding her own instruments and vocals in a DAW to fill it out. The result is what youd expect from a composition relying on the Microsoft GS Wavetable synth.\nMicrosoft might not have cornered the generative music market in the 1990s, but generative AI is making huge waves in the industry today.\n\n", "title": "- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u907a\u7269\u3001Microsoft Music Producer 1.0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eMicrosoft Music Producer 1.0\u306f\u3001AI\u97f3\u697d\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u3051\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u907a\u7269\u3001Microsoft Music Producer 1.0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- AI\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068Microsoft\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u3051", "- MIDI\u3068\u5408\u6210\u97f3\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u751f\u6210\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u7279\u7570\u306a\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30eb\u3068\u30e0\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u97f3\u697d\u751f\u6210\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6AI\u6642\u4ee3\u3078\u306e\u6a4b\u6e21\u3057\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eMicrosoft Music Producer"]}

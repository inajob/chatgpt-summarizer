Think about hot rodders, who squeeze every bit of power out of engines they can, or PC overclockers, who often go to ridiculous ends to milk the maximum performance from a CPU. And so it goes in the world of lasers, where this avalanche driver module turns Nichia laser diodes into fire-breathing beasts.\nOK, that last bit might be a little overstated, but theres no denying the coolness of what laser jock [Les Wright] has accomplished here. In his endless quest for more optical power, [Les] happened upon a paper describing a simple driver circuit that can dump massive amounts of current into a laser diode to produce far more optical power than theyre designed for. [Les] ran with what few details the paper had and came up with a modified avalanche driver circuit, with a few niceties for easier testing, like accommodation for different avalanche transistors and a way to test laser diodes in addition to the Nichia. He also included an onboard current sensing network, making it easy to hook up a high-speed oscilloscope to monitor the performance of the driver.\nFor testing, [Les] used a high-voltage supply homebrewed from a Nixie inverter module along with a function generator to provide the pulses. The driver was able to push 80 amps into a Nichia NUBM47 diode for just a few nanoseconds, and when all the numbers were plugged in, the setup produced about 67 watts of optical power. Not one to let such power go to waste, [Les] followed up with some cool experiments in laser range finding and dye laser pumping, which you can check out in the video below. And check out our back catalog of [Les] many laser projects, from a sketchy tattoo-removal laser teardown to his acousto-optical filter experiments.\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u3067\u3001[Les Wright]\u304c\u5149\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u7c21\u6613\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5927\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u9001\u308a67\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5149\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u751f\u3080\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3084\u67d3\u6599\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u8a66\u9a13\u3082\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u5149\u5b66\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u6ce8\u5165\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u67d3\u6599\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30dd\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30aa\u30b9\u30b7\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30a2\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u8abf\u6574"]}

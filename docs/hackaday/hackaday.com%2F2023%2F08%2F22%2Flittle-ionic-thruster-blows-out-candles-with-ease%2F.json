[Integza] has a video showing how to do exactly that with some simple components. His little thruster manages to blow out candles at surprising distances before being pressed into service propelling a model boat.\nHeres how it works: ionic wind is generated when a strong enough electric field causes nearby air to ionize, for example from sharp tips of a conductor carrying a high enough voltage. This discharge creates ionized air molecules with an electrical charge matching the polarity of the nearby conductor. Because matching polarities repel one another, the small cloud of ionized air molecules are repelled from both the nearby conductor, as well as from each other.\nThe result is a wind-like force from a device with no moving parts, and if the parts are structured right, itll blow out a candle with ease. [Integza] attached a cheap DC high-voltage transformer to a nickel strip cut into sharp points and rolled into a circlet. The other half of the thruster  in contrast to the thin crown of sharp points  is a smooth ring shaped a little like a thruster nozzle. 3D models of the parts are\u00a0 available online\u00a0should you wish to try it yourself without all the trial and error of trying to optimize.\nIn an effort to minimize mass, [Integza] electroplates a 3D-printed version of the large ring with great results, spraying it with graphite first to make it conductive. Cheap and safe copper electroplating is entirely within the reach of hobbyists, and the resulting unit does a pretty nice job. You can watch it in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n", "title": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308bLED\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u3067\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7a7a\u6c17\u5206\u5b50\u304c\u53cd\u767a\u3057\u3001\u52d5\u304b\u306a\u3044\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u308d\u3046\u305d\u304f\u3092\u6d88\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308bLED\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u3092\u5439\u304d\u6d88\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u653e\u96fb\u3067\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u63a8\u9032\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5165\u624b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7121\u99c4\u306e\u306a\u3044\u98a8\u529b\u88c5\u7f6e", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

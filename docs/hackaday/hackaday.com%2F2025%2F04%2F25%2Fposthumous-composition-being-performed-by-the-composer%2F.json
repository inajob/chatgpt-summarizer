The piece he is best known for, I Am Sitting in a Room, explored the acoustics of a room and what happens when you amplify the characteristics that are imparted on sound in that space by repeatedly recording and playing back the sound from one tape machine to another. Other works have employed galvanic skin response sensors, electromagnetically activated piano strings and other components that are not conventionally used in music composition.\nUndoubtedly the most unconventional thing hes done (so far) is to perform in an exhibit at The Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth which opened earlier this month. That in itself would not be so unconventional if it werent for the fact that he passed away in 2021. Let us explain.\n\nWhile he was still alive, Lucier entered into a collaboration with a team of artists and biologists to create an exhibit that would push art, science and our notions of what it means to live beyond ones death into new ground.\nThe resulting exhibit, titled Revivication, is a room filled with gong-like cymbals being played via actuators by Luciers brain\u2026sort of. It is a brain organoid, a bundle of neurons derived from a sample of his blood which had been induced into pluripotent stem cells. The organoid sits on a mesh of electrodes, providing an interface for triggering the cymbals.\nA brain organoid derived from Alvin Luciers blood cells sits on a mesh of electrodes.\nBut the organoid isnt aware of whats happening, its not performing we hear you say. While it is true that the bundle of neurons isnt likely to have intuited hundreds of years of music theory or its subversion by experimental methodology, it is part of a feedback loop that potentially allows it to perceive in some way the result of its actions.\nMicrophones mounted at each cymbal feed electrical stimulus back to the organoid, presumably providing it with something to respond to. Whether it does so in any meaningful way is hard to say.\nThe exhibit asks us to think about where creativity comes from. Is it innate? Is it in our blood so to speak? Do we have agency or are we being conducted? Can we live on beyond our own deaths through some creative act? What, if anything, do brain organoids experience?\nThis makes us think about some of the interesting mind-controlled musical interfaces weve seen, the promise of pluripotent stem cell research, and of course those brain computer interfaces. Oh, and there was that time the Hackaday Podcast featured Alvin Luciers I Am Sitting in a Room on Whats that Sound.\n"}

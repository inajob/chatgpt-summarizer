It can be fun to draw on, but you have to get things right the first time, because theres no undo button. [Tekavou] decided to recreate this popular toy in digital form instead to give it more capabilities.\u00a0\nThe build relies on an Inkplate e-paper screen as a display, which is probably as close you can get in appearance to the aluminium dust and glass screen used in an Etch-a-Sketch. The display is hooked up to an ESP32 microcontroller, which is charged with reading inputs from a pair of rotary encoders.\u00a0In standard drawing mode, it emulates the behavior of an Etch-A-Sketch, with the ESP32 drawing to the e-paper display as the user turns the encoders to move the cursor. However, it has a magical undo feature, where pressing the encoder undoes the last movement, allowing you to craft complex creations without having to get every move perfect on your first attempt.\u00a0As a fun aside, [Tekavou] also included a fun Snake game. More specifically, its inspired by NIBBLES.BAS, a demo program included with Microsoft QBasic back in the day.\nWeve seen all kinds of Etch-A-Sketch builds around these parts, including this impressive roboticized version. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7248\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30fb\u30a2\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7248\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30a2\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u306f\u3001Undo\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u7d75\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u86c7\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7248\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30fb\u30a2\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- ESP32\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30a5\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30fb\u30a2\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "- \u6614\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c8\u30a4", "- \u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u578b\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30fb\u30a2\u30fb\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

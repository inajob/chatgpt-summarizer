While it hasnt had the staying power of franchises like Zelda\u00a0or\u00a0Call of Duty,\u00a0it nonetheless still resonates with gamers today. That includes [Arnov Sharma], who put together this neat handheld version using modern components.\nAn ESP32 development board serves as the brains of the operation. Capable of operating at many hundreds of megahertz, it has an excessive amount of power for an application as simple as this. Nonetheless, its cheap, and it gets the job done. Its paired with an SSD1306 OLED screen of 124 x 32 resolution. That might not sound like much, but its plenty when youre just drawing two paddles and a ball bouncing between them. Control is via a pair of SMD push buttons for a nice responsive feel.\nWhats really neat, though, is the presentation. [Arnov] wrapped the electronics in a neat bean-shaped housing that vaguely apes game controllers of the 16-bit era. Indeed, [Arnov] explains that it was inspired by the Sega Genesis specifically. It looks great with the black PCBs integrated so nicely with the bright orange 3D printed components, and looks quite comfortable to use, too.\nIt might be a simple project, but its done rather well. Just by thinking about color choices and how to assemble the base components, [Arnov] was able to create an attractive and functional game thats a lot more eye catching than some random boards thrown in an old project box. Indeed, weve featured stories on advanced FR4/PCB construction techniques before, too. Meanwhile, if youre creating your own projects with similar techniques, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

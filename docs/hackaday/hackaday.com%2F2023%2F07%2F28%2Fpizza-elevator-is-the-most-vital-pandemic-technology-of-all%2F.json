We were trying to distance ourselves from strangers wherever possible. [scealux]s pizza elevator was spawned at this time to make apartment pizza deliveries as contactless as possible, and its charmingly branded to boot.\nThe build was intended to loft a pizza from street level to a third-floor balcony (by the American convention, ground floor is numbered one). Built with CNC-cut wooden parts, the elevator frame snap-fits on to the balcony railing. From there, a single spool runs out wire to four corners of the elevator platform.\nAs the crank is turned, the platform lowers under its own weight. The pizza can then be placed on the platform, and dinner can be lifted back up to the apartment. Its a simple design, and one that manages to lift the pizza in a stable and flat fashion. With that said, wed still like to see some anti-tip railings on a potential revision two.\nMock the branding all you will, its actually a smart design choice. The recognizable logo made the devices purpose super obvious to the pizza delivery person, easing the introduction of the technology to a new user base.\nIf you want to make your own pizza instead of ordering out, you can automate that too.\n\n"}

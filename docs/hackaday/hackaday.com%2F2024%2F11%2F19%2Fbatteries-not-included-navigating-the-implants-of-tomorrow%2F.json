Picture implantable medical devices that don\u2019t need batteries\u2014no more surgeries for replacements or bulky contraptions. Though not all new (see below), ChemistryWorld recently shed new light on these innovations. It\u2019s as exciting as it is unnerving; we, as hackers, know too well that tech and biology blend a fine ethical line. Realising our bodies can be hacked both tickles our excitement and unsettlement, posing deeper questions about human-machine integration.\nSince the first pacemaker hit the scene in 1958, powered by rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries and induction coils, progress has been steady but bound by battery limitations. Now, researchers like Jacob Robinson from Rice University are flipping the script, moving to designs that harvest energy from within. Whether through mechanical heartbeats or lung inflation, these implants are shifting to a network of energy-harvesting nodes.\nFrom triboelectric nanogenerators made of flexible, biodegradable materials to piezoelectric devices tapping body motion is quite a leap. John Rogers at Northwestern University points out that the real challenge is balancing power extraction without harming the body\u2019s natural function. Energy isn\u2019t free-flowing; overharvesting could strain or damage organs. A topic we also addressed in April of this year.\nAs we edge toward battery-free implants, these breakthroughs could redefine biomedical tech. A good start on diving into this paradigm shift and past innovations is this article from 2023. Itll get you on track of some prior innovations in this field. Happy tinkering, and: stay critical! For we hackers know that theres an alternative use for everything!", "title": "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u751f\u4f53\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5c55", "body": "\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6700\u524d\u7dda\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u533b\u7642\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u502b\u7406\u7684\u8ab2\u984c\u3082\u542b\u3081\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u304c\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u751f\u4f53\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5c55", "\u751f\u4f53\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u502b\u7406\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u751f\u7269\u306e\u63a5\u70b9", "\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u5185\u8535\u304b\u3089\u53ce\u7a6b\u3059\u308b\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u8106\u5f31\u306a\u4f53\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u767a\u96fb\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

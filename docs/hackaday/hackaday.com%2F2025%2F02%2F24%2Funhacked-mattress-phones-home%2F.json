Apparently this set him back about $2,000, it only works if it has Internet, and the bed wants $19 a month for anything beyond basic features. Unsurprisingly, [Dylan] decided to try to hack the mattress firmware and share what he learned with us.\nOddly enough, it was easy to just ask the update URL for the firmware and download it. Inside, it turned out there was a mechanism for eng@eightsleep.com to remotely SSH into any bed and  well  do just about anything. You may wonder why anyone wants to gain control of your bed. But if you are on the network, this could be a perfect place to launch an attack on the network and beyond.\nOf course, they can also figure out when you sleep, if you sleep alone or not, and, of course, when no one is in the bed. But if those things bother you, maybe dont get an Internet-connected bed.\nOddly enough, the last time we saw a bed hack, it was from [Dillan], not [Dylan]. Just because you dont want Big Sleep to know when you are in bed doesnt mean it isnt useful for your private purposes."}

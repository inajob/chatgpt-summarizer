How it ended: a scratch-built FM drum synth module thats completely analog, and completely cool.\n[Moritz Klein]s journey down the analog drum machine rabbit hole started with a Roland TR-909, a hybrid drum machine from the mid-80s that combined sampled sounds with analog synthesis. The unit [Moritz] picked up was having trouble with the decay on the kick drum, so he spread out the gloriously detailed schematic and got to work. He breadboarded a few sections of the kick drum circuit to aid troubleshooting, but one thing led to another and he was soon in new territory.\nThe video below is on the longish side, with the first third or so dedicated to recreating the circuits used to create the 909s iconic sound, slightly modifying some of them to simplify construction. Like the schematic that started the whole thing, this section of the video is jam-packed with goodness, too much to detail here. But a few of the gems that caught our eye were the voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) circuit that seems to make appearances in multiple places in the circuit, and the dead-simple wave-shaper circuit, which takes some of the harmonics out of the triangle wave oscillators output with just a couple of diodes and some resistors.\nOnce the 909s kick and toms section had been breadboarded, [Moritz] turned his attention to adding something Roland hadnt included: frequency modulation. He did this by adding a second, lower-frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and using that to modulate the drum section. That resulted in a weird, metallic sound that can be tuned to imitate anything from a steel drum to a bell. He also added a hi-hat and cymbal section by mixing the square wave outputs on the VCOs through a funky XOR gate made from discrete components and a high-pass filter.\nTheres a lot of information packed into this video, and by breaking everything down into small, simple blocks, [Moritz] makes it easy to understand analog synths and the circuits behind them.\n\n", "title": "\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9TR-909\u4fee\u7406\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u65c5", "body": "Roland\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u4fee\u7406\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0FM\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3002\u56de\u8def\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u3082\u5145\u5b9f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9TR-909\u4fee\u7406\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u65c5", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5cFM\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "\u62e1\u5f35\u3055\u308c\u305f909\uff1a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u5909\u8abf\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u56de\u8def\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u76f4\u611f\u7684\u306b\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u305d\u306e\u56de\u8def\u306e\u4e16\u754c"]}

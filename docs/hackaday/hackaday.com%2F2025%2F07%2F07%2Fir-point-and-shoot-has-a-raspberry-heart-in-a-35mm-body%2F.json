There are other options, though and when [Malcolm Wilson] decided he wanted to explore them, he decided to build a (near) IR camera.\u00a0\nThe IR images are almost ethereal.Image : Malcom Wilson.\nThe housing is an old Yashica Electro 35  apparently this model was prone to electrical issues, and there are a lot of broken camera bodies floating around which hides a Pi NoIR Camera v3. That camera module, paired with an IR pass filter, makes for infrared photography like the old Yashica used to do with special film. The camera module is plugged into a Pi Zero 2 W, and its powered by a PiSugar battery. Theres a tiny (0.91) OLED display, but its only for status messages. The viewfinder is 100% optical, as the designers of this camera intended. Point, shoot, shoot again.\nTheres something pure in that experience; we sometimes find stopping to look at previews pulls one out of the creative zone of actually taking pictures. This camera wont let you do that, though of course you do get to skip on developing photos. [Malcom] has the Pi set up to connect to his Wifi when he gets home, and he grabs the RAW (he is a photographer, after all) image files via SSH.\u00a0 Follow the link above to [Malcom]s substack, and youll get some design details and his python code.\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundations NoIR camera shows up on these pages from time to time, though rarely so artistically. Were more likely to see it spying on reptiles, or make magic wands work.\u00a0 So we are quite grateful\u00a0to [Malcom] for the tip, via Petapixel. Yes, photographers and artists of all stripes are welcome to use the tips line to tell us about their work.\nFollow the links in this article for more images like this.Image: Malcom Wilson", "title": "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u300d", "body": "\u30de\u30eb\u30b3\u30e0\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3002Yashica Electro 35\u306e\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306bPi NoIR\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u5199\u771f\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebIR\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "\u300cYashica Electro 35\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u64ae\u5f71\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3001Pi NoIR\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300cMalcolm Wilson\u306b\u3088\u308bIR\u753b\u50cf\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u3068\u6280\u8853\u300d"]}

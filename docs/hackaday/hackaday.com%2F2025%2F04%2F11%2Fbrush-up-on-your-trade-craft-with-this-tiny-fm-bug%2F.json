True, field agents arent likely to need to build their own equipment, but how cool a spy would you be if you could?\nLuckily, you wont need too many parts to recreate [Ciprian (YO6DXE)]s project, most of which could be found in a decently stocked junk bin, or even harvested from e-waste. On the downside, the circuit is pretty fussy, with even minor component value changes causing a major change in center frequency. [Ciprian] had to do a lot of fiddling to get the frequency in the FM band, particularly with the inductor in the LC tank circuit. Even dropping battery voltage shifted the frequency significantly, which required a zener diode to address.\n[Ciprian] ran a few tests and managed to get solid copy out to 80 meters range, which is pretty impressive for such a limited circuit. The harmonics, which extend up into the ham bands and possibly beyond, are a bit of a problem; while those could be addressed with a low-pass filter, in practical terms, the power of this little fellow is probably low enough to keep you from getting into serious trouble. Still, its best not to push your luck.\nWhile youre trying your hand at one-transistor circuits, you might want to try [Ciprian]s one-transistor CW transceiver next.\n\n"}

Its well-known as one of the blackest possible coatings around, capable of absorbing almost all visible light in its nanotube complex structure. However, its complicated to apply, delicate, and not readily available, especially to those in the art world.\nIt was these drawbacks that led Stuart Semple to create his own incredibly black paint. Over the years, hes refined the formula and improved its performance, steadily building a greater product available to all. His latest effort is Black 4.0, and its promising to be the black paint to dominate all others.\n\nBack in Black\nThis journey began in a wonderfully spiteful fashion. Upon hearing that one Anish Kapoor had secured exclusive rights to be the sole artistic user of Vantablack, he determined that something had to be done. Seven years ago, he set out to create his own ultra black paint that would far outperform conventional black paints on the market. Since his first release, hes been delivering black paints that suck in more light and just simply look blacker\u00a0than anything else out there.\nBlack 4.0 has upped the ante to a new level. Speaking to Hackaday, Semple explained the performance of the new paint, being sold through his Culture Hustle website. Black 4.0 absorbs an astonishing 99.95% of visible light which is about as close to full light absorption as youll ever get in a paint, said Semple. He notes this outperforms Vantablacks S-Vis spray on product which only achieves 99.8%, as did his previous Black 3.0 paint. Those numbers are impressive, and wed dearly love to see the new paint put to the test against other options in the ultra black market.\n\nIt might sound like mere fractional percentages, but it makes a difference. In sample tests, the new paint is more capable of fun visual effects since it absorbs yet more light. Under indoor lighting conditions, an item coated in Black 4.0 can appear to have no surface texture at all, looking to be a near-featureless black hole. Place an object covered in Black 4.0 on a surface coated in the same, and it virtually disappears. All the usual reflections and shadows that help us understand 3D geometry simply get sucked into the overwhelming blackness.\nBlack 4.0 compared to a typical black acrylic art paint.

For many use cases, a single coat is all thats needed.\u00a0It feels much nicer to use, its much more stable, more durable, and obviously much blacker, he says, adding The 3.0 would occasionally separate and on rare occasions collect little salt crystals at the surface, thats all gone now.\nThe added performance comes down to a new formulation of the paints super-base resin, which carries the pigment and mattifying compounds that give the paint its rich, dreamy darkness. Its seen a few ingredient substitutions compared to previous versions, but a process change also went a long way to creating an improved product. The interesting thing is that although all that helped, it was the process we used to make the paint that gave us the breakthrough, the order we add things, the way we mix them, and the temperature, Semple told Hackaday.\nThe ultra black paint has a way of making geometry disappear.

You could certainly coat a car in it, for example, but it probably wouldnt hold up in the long term. Hes particularly excited for applications in astronomy and photography, where the extremely black paint can help catch light leaks and improve the performance of telescopes and cameras. Its also perfect for creating an ultra black photographic backdrop, too.\nNo special application methods are required; Black 4.0 can be brush painted just like its predecessors. Indeed, it absorbs so much light that you probably dont need to worry as much about brush marks as you usually would. Other methods, like using rollers or airbrushes, are perfectly fine, too.\nCreating such a high-performance black paint didnt come without challenges, either. Along the way, Semple contended with canisters of paint exploding, legal threats from others in the market, and one of the main scientists leaving the project. Wrangling supplies of weird and wonderful ingredients was understandably difficult, too.\u00a0 Nonetheless, he persevered, and has now managed to bring the first batches to market.\nThe first batches ship in November, so if youre eager to get some of the dark stuff, youd better move quick. It doesnt come cheap, but youre always going to pay more for something claiming to be the worlds best. If youve got big plans, fear not\u2014this time out, Semple will sell the paint in huge bulk 1 liter and 6 liter containers if you really need a job lot. Have fun out there, and if you do something radical, you know who to tell about it."}

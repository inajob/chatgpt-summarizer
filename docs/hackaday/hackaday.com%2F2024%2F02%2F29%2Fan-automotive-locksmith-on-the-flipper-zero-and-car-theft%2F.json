A few days ago we were rewarded in spades by the Canadian Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, who railed against the Flipper Zero, promising to ban it as a tool that could be used to gain keyless entry to a vehicle.\nOf course our community has roundly debunked this assertion, as capable though the Flipper is, the car industrys keyless entry security measures are many steps ahead of it. Weve covered the story from a different angle before, but its worth returning to it for an automotive locksmiths view on the matter from [Surlydirtbag].\nHe immediately debunks the idea of the Flipper being used for keyless entry systems, pointing out that thieves have been using RF relay based attacks which access the real key for that task for many years now. He goes on to address another concern, that the Flipper could be used to clone the RFID chip of a car key, and concludes that it can in the case of some very old vehicles whose immobilizers used simple versions of the technology, but not on anything recent enough to interest a car thief.\nOf course, to many readers this will not exactly be news. But its still important, because perhaps some of us will have had to discuss this story with non-technical people who might be inclined to believe such scare stories. Being able to say Dont take it from me, take it from an automotive locksmith might just help. Meanwhile there is still the concern of CAN bus attacks to contend with, something the manufacturers could have headed off had they only separated their on-board subsystems.\n\n"}

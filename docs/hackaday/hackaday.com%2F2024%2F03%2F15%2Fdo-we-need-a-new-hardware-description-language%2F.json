There are others, of course, but those are the two elephants in the room. Do we need another one? [Veryl-lang] thinks so. The Veryl language is sort of Verilog meets Rust. What makes Veryl interesting is that it transpiles to normal SystemVerilog, so it will  probably  work with your existing tool chains.\nThat means you can define your logic Veryl, have it output SystemVerilog, and then use that Verilog in your vendors (or an open source) Verilog tool. The output is supposed to be human-readable Verilog, too, so you dont have to transport opaque blocks of gibberish.\n\nYou can find an example of the language on GitHub in the documentation. If you can read any HDL, you wont find it very different. That might be the weakest part  from a users point of view, this might just as well be Verilog. The documentation claims that parsing the language is easier, but if you are just going to convert it to Verilog anyway, it might be as well to just write to Verilog. Then again, we know Verilog well enough that we are probably biased.\nIf you want to try it easily, theres a browser-based playground to try. For example, the input:\n\n// module declaration\nmodule Hackaday (\n   // module port\n   v : input logic32,\n   q : output logic32\n) {\n   assign q=~v;\n  }\n\nResulted in:\n\n\n// module declaration\nmodule project_Hackaday (\n// module port\ninput logic [32-1:0] v,\noutput logic [32-1:0] q\n);\nassign q = ~v;\nendmodule\n\n\nPerhaps a little nicer, but not an overwhelming improvement.\nWhat do you think? Will you try Veryl? Let us know in the comments. It isnt the only alterative choice, of course.

It is full of food for thought, if you\u2019re building something small with motors and need to figure out how to spec them out.\nA Push Stick\nAside from a few good examples, what I really took home from this piece is how easy it can be to take approximate measurements. Take the push stick, which is a spring-loaded plunger in a transparent barrel. You use it to measure force by, well, squeezing the spring and reading off how far it deflects. That\u2019s obvious, but the real trick is in calibration by pushing it into a weighing scale and marking divisions on the barrel. That quickly and easily turns \u201cit\u2019s pressing this hard\u201d into an actual numerical force measurement.\nThe accuracy and precision of the push stick are limited by the quality of your scale and the fineness of the pen tip that you use to mark the barrel. But when you\u2019re just looking to choose among two servo motors, this kind of seat-of-the-pants measure is more than enough to buy the right part. Almost any actual measurement is better than a wild-ass guess, so don\u2019t hold yourself to outrageous standards or think that improvised quantitative measurement devices aren\u2019t going to get the job done.\nAl Williams quoted a teacher of his as saying that the soul of metrology is \u201ctaking something you know and using it to find something you don\u2019t know\u201d, and that sums up this piece nicely. But it\u2019s also almost a hacker manifesto: \u201ctake something you can do and use it to do something that you can\u2019t (yet)\u201d.\nGot any good measurement hacks youd like to share?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

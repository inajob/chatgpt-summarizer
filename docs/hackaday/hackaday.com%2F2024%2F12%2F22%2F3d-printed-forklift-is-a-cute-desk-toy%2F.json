Sadly, most warehouses take a dim view of horseplay with these machines, so few of us get to live out those fantasies. Playing with this desk-sized RC model from [ProfessorBoots] is probably a safer way to get those kicks instead. You can check it out in the video below.\nThe 3D-printed body of the forklift is the first thing you see. Its great quality, and it instantly puts you in mind of the real thing. The build is true to the dynamics of a real forklift, too, with proper rear steering. Inside, theres a custom circuit board hosting an ESP32 that serves as the brain of the operation. Its onboard wireless hardware allows remote control of the forklift via a smartphone app, PS4 controller, or many other options. It controls the drive motors and steering servo, along with another motor driving a threaded rod to move the forks up and down. The whole thing is powered by two Fenix 16340 batteries\u2014small lithium-ion cells that can be recharged with an integral micro USB port.\nThe project video is very thorough about the design and build. Its worth watching just to understand the specifics of how forklifts actually raise their forks up and down. Its good stuff.\nThis forklift is just the latest RC build from [ProfessorBoots]. Hes done great work in this space before, like this charming skid steer and incredibly complex crane.\n\n"}

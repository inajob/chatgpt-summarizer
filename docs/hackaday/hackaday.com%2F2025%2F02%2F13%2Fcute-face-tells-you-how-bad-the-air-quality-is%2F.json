Or, like [Makestreme], you could go for a more human visual interface. Hes built a air quality monitor that conveys its information via facial expressions on a small screen.\nNamed Gus, the monitor is based around a Xiao ESP32-C3. Its hooked up with the SeeedStudio Grove air quality sensor, which can pick up everything from carbon monoxide to a range of vaguely toxic and volatile gases. Theres also a THT22 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity. Its all wrapped up in a cute 3D-printed robot housing that [Makestreme] created in Fusion 360. A small OLED display serves as Guss face.\nThe indications of poor air quality are simple and intuitive. As Gus detects poor air, his eyelids droop and he begins to look more gloomy. Of course, that doesnt necessarily tell you what you should do to fix the air quality. If your issue is pollution from outside, youll probably want to shut windows or turn on an air purifier. On the other hand, if your issue is excess CO2, youll want to open a window and let fresh air in. Its a limitation of this project that it cant really detect particulates or CO2, but instead is limited to CO and volatiles instead. Still, its something that could be worked around with richer sensors a more expressive face. Some will simply prefer hard numbers, though, whatever the case. To that end, you can tap Guss head to get more direct information from what the sensors are seeing.\nWeve seen some other great air quality projects before, too, with remarkably similar ideas behind them. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Willem de Vries for the tip!]"}

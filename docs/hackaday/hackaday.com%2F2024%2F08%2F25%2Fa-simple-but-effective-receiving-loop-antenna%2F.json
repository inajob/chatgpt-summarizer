Random pieces of wire may pull in some signal, but along with it comes a ton of unwanted interference and noise. Its thus worth putting in the effort to make a better antenna, and if youre not fortunate enough to have a lot of space, your best choice may be a magnetic loop. [Robert Hart] takes us through the design of a receive-only coaxial loop. Its referred to as a Moebius loop because the conductor takes a twist path between the inner and outer halfway around.\nThe idea of a loop antenna is simple enough. Its an inductor intended to respond to the magnetic portion of the wave rather than the electric part. Theyre normally made of a single turn of wire in a loop of diameter well below half a wavelength, and, in their transmitting versions, they are often tuned to resonance by an air-spaced variable capacitor. Coaxial loops like this one provide enhanced resistance to electrical noise. Hes using some rather expensive Andrews coax for its rigidity, but the less well-heeled can use cheaper stuff without penalty. The result, when put on a frame of PVC pipe and a speaker stand, is an excellent portable receiving antenna, and if were being honest, something we might also consider in our own shack.\n\nThis isnt by any means the first magnetic loop weve brought you. Have a look at this cleverly concealed one. We recently looked at the YouLoop, a similar Moebius loop antenna."}

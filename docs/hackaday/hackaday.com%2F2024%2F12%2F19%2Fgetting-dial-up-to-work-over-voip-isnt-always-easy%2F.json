Theyre now largely esoteric relics from a time gone by. With regular old phone lines rather hard to come by these days, [Peter Mount] decided to try getting a pair of dial-up modems working over VoIP instead.\nThe build started with a pair of Linksys PAP2T VoIP phone adapters, which were originally designed for hooking regular phones up to VoIP systems. He paired each US Robotics modem with a PAP2T, and then hooked both into a VoIP Private Branch Exchange which he set up using 3cx on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The Pi also acted as a server for the modems to connect to. It took a lot of fiddly configuration steps, but he found success in the end. On YouTube, he demonstrates the setup\u2014with that glorious modem sound\u2014communicating successfully at a rate of 9600 baud.\nIts nice to see this vintage hardware communicating in a what is effectively a simulated world created entirely within modern hardware. Weve seen similar projects before, like this attempt to get dial-up going over Discord. If youre doing your own odd-ball screechy communications experiments, dont hesitate to drop us a line!\n\n"}

[Yaky] has a Nokia N900, and is giving it a go.\nBack in the 2000s, Nokia\u00a0owned the mobile phone space. They had a smartphone OS even if they didnt understand app distribution, they had the best cameras, screens, antennas, the lot. They threw it all away with inept management that made late-stage Commodore look competent, Apple and Android came along, and now a Nokia is a rarity. Out of this mess came one good thing though, the N900 was a Linux-based smartphone that became the go-to hacker mobile for a few years.\nFirst up with this N900 is the long-dead battery. He makes a fake battery with a set of supercapacitors and resistors to simulate the temperature sensor, and is then able to power it from an external PSU. This is refined to a better fake battery using the connector from the original. The device also receives a USB-C port, though due to space constraints not the PD identifiers, making it (almost) modern.\nBecause it was a popular hacker device, its possible to upgrade the software on an N900. Hes given it U-Boot, and now it boots Linux form an SD card and functions as an online radio device.\nThats impressive hackability and longevity for a phone, if only we could have more like it.", "title": "2009\u5e74\u88fdNokia N900\u306e\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a2025\u5e74\u3067\u3082\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "body": "2009\u5e74\u88fd\u306eNokia N900\u30922025\u5e74\u306b\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3002\u6539\u9020\u306b\u3088\u308aLinux\u8d77\u52d5\u3084USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["2009\u5e74\u88fdNokia N900\u306e\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a2025\u5e74\u3067\u3082\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "\u53e4\u3073\u305fLinux\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff1aN900\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u5316\u3068\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5922\u3001Nokia N900\uff1a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u7526\u3089\u305b\u308b\u624b\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Nokia N900\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4e8b\u4f8b"]}

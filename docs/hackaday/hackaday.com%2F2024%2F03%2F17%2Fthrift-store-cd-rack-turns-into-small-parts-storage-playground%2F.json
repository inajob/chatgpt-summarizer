First of all, were not sure the CD is quite dead yet; weve got about a thousand of them packed away somewhere, and were pretty sure theyll be back in style again one of these days. Until then, though, the lowly CD rack might be just what you need to get your shop under control.\nAs [Chris Borge] relates the story, he stumbled over this CD rack at a thrift sale and quickly realized its potential. All it took was some quick design work and a bit of 3D printing. Okay, a lot of 3D printing, including some large, flat expanses for the drawer bottoms, which can be a problem to print reliably. His solution was simple but clever: pause the print and insert a piece of stiff card stock to act as the drawer bottom before continuing to print the sides. This worked well but presented an adhesion problem later when he tried to print some drawer dividers, so those were printed as a separate job and inserted later.\nSadly, [Chris] notes that the CD format is not quite Gridfinity compatible, but thats not a deal breaker. He also doesnt provide any build files, but none are really necessary. Once youve got the basic footprint, what you do with your drawers is largely dependent on what youve got to store. The video below has a lot of ideas for whats possible, but honestly, were looking at all those little parts assortment kits from Bojack and Hilitchi piled up in a drawer and just dreaming about the possibilities here. Add a voice-activated, LED inventory locator, and youd really have something. Off to the thrift store!\n\n"}

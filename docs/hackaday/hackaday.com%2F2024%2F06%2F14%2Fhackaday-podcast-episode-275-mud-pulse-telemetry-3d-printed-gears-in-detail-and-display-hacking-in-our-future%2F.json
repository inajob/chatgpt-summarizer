Things kick off with the news about Raspberry Pi going public, and what that might mean for everyones favorite single-board computer. From there theyll cover the technology behind communicating through mud, DIY pressure vessels, pushing the 1983 TRS-80 Model 100 to its limits, and the reality of 3D printing how that the hype has subsided. Youll also hear about modifying Nissans electric vehicles, bringing new life to one of the GameCubes oddest peripherals, and an unusually intelligent kayak.\nThe episode wraps up with some interesting (or depressing) numbers that put into perspective just how much copper is hiding in our increasingly unused telephone network, and a look at how hardware hackers can bend the display technology thats used in almost all modern consumer electronics to our advantage.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nGrab the Collectors Edition MP3 of this weeks episode right here.

Sometimes it\u2019s because Plan A never works out the way I think it will, due to either naivety or simply the random blockers that always get in the way and need surmounting. But a decent percentage of the time, it\u2019s because something really cool happens along the way. Indeed, my favorite kind of \u201csimple\u201d projects are those that open up your eyes to a new world of possibilities or experiments that, taken together, are nothing like simple anymore.\nAl and I were talking about water rockets on the podcast the other day, and I realized that this was a perfect example of an open-ended simple project. It sounds really easy: you put some water in a soda bottle, pressurize it a bit with air, and then let it go. Water gets pushed down, bottle flies up. Done?\nOh no! The first step into more sophistication is the aerodynamics. But honestly, if you make something vaguely rocket-shaped with fins, it\u2019ll probably work. Then you probably need a parachute release mechanism. And then some data logging? An accelerometer and barometer? A small video camera? That gets you to the level of [ARRO]\u2019s work that spawned our discussion.\nBut it wasn\u2019t ten minutes into our discussion that Al had already suggested making the pressure vessel with carbon fiber and doctoring the water mix to make it denser. You\u2019d not be surprised that these and other elaborations have been tried out. Or you could go multi-stage, or vector-thrust, or\u2026\nIn short, water rockets are one of those \u201csimple\u201d projects. You can get one basically working in a weekend day, and then if you\u2019re so inclined, you could spend an entire summer of weekends chasing down the finer points, building larger and larger tubes, and refining payloads.

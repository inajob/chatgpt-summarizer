Or, you can employ them to more interesting ends, such as porting Macintosh System 7 to the x86 architecture, like [Kelsi Davis] did.\nWhen Apple created the Macintosh lineup in the 1980s, it based the computer around Motorolas 68K CPU architecture. These 16-bit/32-bit CPUs were plenty capable for the time, but the platform ultimately didnt have the same expansive future as Intels illustrious x86 architecture that underpinned rival IBM-compatible machines.\n[Kelsi Davis] decided to port the Macintosh System 7 OS to run on native x86 hardware, which would be challenging enough with full access to the source code. However, she instead performed this task by analyzing and reverse engineering the System 7 binaries with the aid of Ghidra and a large language model. Soon enough, she had the classic System 7 desktop running on QEMU with a fully-functional Finder and the GUI working as expected. [Kelsi] credits the LLM with helping her achieve this feat in just three days, versus what she would expect to be a multi-year effort if working unassisted.\nFiles are on GitHub for the curious. We love a good port around these parts; we particularly enjoyed these efforts to recreate Portal on the N64.

Recently [Andrew Conlin] wrote about how to use MicroZig with the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU, showing the process of writing an SSD1306 OLED display driver and running it. Although MicroZig has since published a built-in version, the blog post gives a good impression of what developing with MicroZig is like.\nZig is a programming language which seeks to improve on the C language, adding memory safety, safe pointers (via option types), while keeping as much as possible of what makes C so useful for low-level development intact. The MicroZig project customizes Zig for use in embedded projects,\u00a0 targeting platforms including the Raspberry Pi MCUs and STM32.\u00a0 During [Andrew]s usage of MicroZig it was less the language or supplied tooling that tripped him up, and more just the convoluted initialization of the SSD1306 controller, which is probably a good sign. The resulting project code can be found on his GitHub page.", "title": "- Raspberry Pi RP2040\u3067\u306eMicroZig\u306b\u3088\u308bOLED\u8868\u793a\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "MicroZig\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Raspberry Pi RP2040\u3067SSD1306\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u4f5c\u6210\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002Zig\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u3001\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306b\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi RP2040\u3067\u306eMicroZig\u306b\u3088\u308bOLED\u8868\u793a\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- MicroZig: C\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u9032\u5316\u7cfb\u3067\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u958b\u767a\u5165\u9580", "- Zig\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4f4e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u958b\u767a\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- SSD1306\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u521d\u671f\u5316\u554f\u984c\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- MicroZig\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u4f8b\u3068\u6210\u679c\u7269\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

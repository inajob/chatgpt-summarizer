It almost never works cleanly. Often there are missing schematic symbols, scrambled PCB footprints, and plenty of other problems. Thankfully [shabaz] shows how to import EAGLE projects into KiCad 7 and fix the most common problems one is likely to encounter in the process. Frankly, the information couldnt come at a better time.\nThis is very timely now that EAGLE has gone the way of the dodo. CadSoft EAGLE used to be a big shot when it came to PCB design for small organizations or individual designers, but six years after being purchased by Autodesk they are no more. KiCad 7 is a staggeringly capable open-source software package containing some fantastic features for beginner and advanced designers alike.\nOf course, these kinds of tutorials tend to be perishable because software changes over time. So if youre staring down a migration from EAGLE to KiCad and could use some guidance, theres no better time than the present. [shabaz]s video showing the process is embedded below.\nThanks to [problemchild68] for the tip!\n\n"}

Yes, it exists. This video by [ToolTechGeek] shows his titanium flat-cut design tipping the scales at only 1.9 grams\u2014lighter than the 2.5-gram copper penny jingling in your pocket. His reasoning: where most everyday carry (EDC) tools are bulky, overpriced, or simply too much, this hack flips the equation: reduce it to the absolute minimum, yet keep it useful.\nYou might have seen this before. This second attempt is done by laser-cutting titanium instead of stainless steel. Thinner, tougher, and rust-proof, titanium slashes the weight dramatically, while still keeping edges functional without sharpening. Despite the size, this tool manages to pack in a Phillips and flathead screwdriver, a makeshift saw, a paint-lid opener, a wire bender (yes, tested on a paperclip), and even a 1/4 wrench doubling as a bit driver. High-torque screwdriving by using the long edges is a clever exploit, and yes\u2014it scrapes wood, snaps zip ties, and even forces a bottle cap open, albeit a bit roughly.\nIt\u2019s not about replacing your Leatherman; it\u2019s about carrying something instead of nothing. Ultra-minimalist, featherlight, pocket-slip friendly\u2014bet you cant find a reason not to just have it in your pocket.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u8d85\u8efd\u91cf\uff011.9\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u88fd\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "body": "1.9\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u88fd\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u8d85\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u8d85\u8efd\u91cf\uff011.9\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u88fd\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "- \u300c\u65e5\u5e38\u6301\u3061\u6b69\u304d\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "- \u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730\uff1a\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "- \u300c\u8584\u578b\u3067\u9811\u4e08\u3001\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "- \u300c\u5fc5\u8981\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d"]}

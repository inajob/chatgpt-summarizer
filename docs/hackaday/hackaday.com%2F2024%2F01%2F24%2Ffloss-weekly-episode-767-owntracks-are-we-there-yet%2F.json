Its built around the simple idea of taking position data from a mobile phone or other data source, sending it over MQTT to a central server, and logging that data to a simple data store.\nFrom there, you can share it as trips, mark points of interest, play back your movement in a web browser, and more. And because its just JSON inside MQTT, its pretty trivial to make a connector to interface with other projects, like Home Assistant. Weve even covered the process!\n\n Project Web site: https://owntracks.org/\n Documentation: https://owntracks.org/booklet/\n Source code: https://github.com/owntracks\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord? Next week were interviewing Jan-Piet Mens of the OwnTracks project!\n\nDirect Download in DRM-free MP3.\nIf youd rather read along, heres the transcript for this weeks episode.\nPlaces to follow the FLOSS Weekly Podcast:\n\n\n\t<!--  Google Podcasts  -->\n\t<!-- iTunes  -->\n\tSpotify\n\t<!--  Stitcher  -->\n\tRSS\n\t\t<!-- YouTube  -->\n"}

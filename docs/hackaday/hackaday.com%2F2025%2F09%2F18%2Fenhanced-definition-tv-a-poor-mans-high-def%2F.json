One of these contenders was Enhanced Definition TV (EDTV), which was 480p in either 4:3 or 16:9, as a step up from Standard Definition TV (SDTV) traditional TV quality. The convoluted history of EDTV and the long transition to proper HDTV is the subject of a recent video by [VWestlife].\nOne reason why many people arent aware of EDTV is because of marketing. With HDTV being the hot new bullet point to slap on a product, a TV being widescreen was often enough to market an EDTV with 480p as HD, not to mention the HD-compatible bullet point that you could see everywhere.\nThat said, the support for digital 480p and simplified 1080i signals of EDTV makes these displays still quite usable today, more than SDTV CRTs and LCDs that are usually limited to analog signals-only at regular NTSC, PAL or SECAM. It may not be HD, but at least its enhanced.\n\n", "title": "- EDTV\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u6a19\u6e96\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u304b\u3089\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3078\u306e\u9053\u306e\u308a", "body": "EDTV\u306f480p\u3067HDTV\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u4e2d\u306b\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30fc\u30b1\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u3042\u307e\u308a\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- EDTV\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u6a19\u6e96\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u304b\u3089\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3078\u306e\u9053\u306e\u308a", "- EDTV\u3068HDTV\u306e\u30de\u30fc\u30b1\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6226\u4e89\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- 480p\u306eEDTV\u304c\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u7406\u7531", "- \u6614\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6280\u8853\uff1aEDTV\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u3068\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3078\uff1aEDTV\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u9032\u5316 "]}

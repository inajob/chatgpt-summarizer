A night at the opera perhaps, some Tchaikovsky from the symphony orchestra, or maybe a bit of Shakespeare? No, were going to a demo party, because the demoscene is the latest art form to be accepted as officially a part of the national cultural heritage of the Netherlands.This builds on successes adding the scene to the cultural heritage registers of Finland, Germany, and Poland, and should provide a boost to other bids in countries such as Switzerland and eventual UNESCO world acceptance.\nIts all very cool that one of our wider communitys art forms is at last being taken seriously rather than being dismissed by the establishment, because along with greater recognition comes other benefits. Sadly we dont expect any cities to shell out for a demo auditorium next to the shiny new opera house any time soon, but we can see that it could be used to the benefit of for example a hackerspace chasing grants. meanwhile, feast your eyes on a bit of cultural heritage courtesy of the Dutch Centre For Intangible Cultural Heritage (Dutch language, English translation).\nNot sure what the demo scene is? Weve taken you to a demoparty before.\nHeader image: People Celebrating Evoke 2019  Foto Darya Gulyamova", "title": "\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u56fd\u306e\u6587\u5316\u907a\u7523\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a8d\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f", "body": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ed\u30a6\u306a\u6587\u5316\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30bf\u30ad\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u30a4\u30d6\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30a6\u30f3\u3092\u6e96\u5099\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u6587\u5316\u907a\u7523\u306b\u8a8d\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u56fd\u3005\u3067\u3082\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u56fd\u306e\u6587\u5316\u907a\u7523\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a8d\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f", "\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u306b\u8a8d\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u4e00\u6b69\u3092\u8e0f\u307f\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f", "\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d99\u627f\u3068\u767a\u5c55", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u52a9\u6210\u91d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u308b", "\u30c7\u30e2\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6587\u5316\u7684\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

Now, he has a Stream Deck Plus, and with the same desire, he reverse-engineered it as well.\nThe device has eight buttons, a narrow screen, and four encoder dials. The device looks like a generic HID device to the host machine, and once it has been configured, doesnt need any special software to function. By configuring the device using the official software in a virtual machine under the watchful eye of Wireshark, it was possible to figure out how that initial setup worked and recreate it using a different software stack.\nIf youve never done this kind of thing before, there is a lot of information about how to find USB data and draw inferences from it. The buttons send messages when pressed, of course. But they also accept a message that tells them what to display on their tiny screen. The device screen itself isnt very big at 800100.\n[Den] packages everything up in the DeckSurf SDK, an open source project that lets you control Stream Decks. So if you just want to control the Deck, you dont need to know all these details. But, for us, thats where the fun is.\nWay back in 2015, we covered some guy who had sniffed out a USB signal generator. That was easy since it was a serial port. However, you can go pretty far down the rabbit hole.", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u306e\u89e3\u653e\uff1aStream Deck\u306e\u9006\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "Den Delimarsky\u306fStream Deck\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u306e\u89e3\u653e\uff1aStream Deck\u306e\u9006\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "- Stream Deck Plus\u3092\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u72ec\u81ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- USB\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u89e3\u6790\u3068\u6a5f\u5668\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- DeckSurf SDK\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067Stream Deck\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1aUSB\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u89e3\u8aad\u3068\u5fdc\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

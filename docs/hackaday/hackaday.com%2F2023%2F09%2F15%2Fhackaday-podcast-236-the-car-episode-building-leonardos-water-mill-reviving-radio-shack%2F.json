We both took the bait, with tales of privacy-violating cars and taillights that can both cripple a pickup and financially cripple its owner. We went medieval  OK, more like renaissance  on a sawmill, pulled a popular YouTuber out of the toilet, and pondered what an animal-free circus would be like. Is RadioShack coming back? Can an ESP32 board get much smaller than this? And where are all the retro(computer)virus writers? We delve into these questions and more, while still saving a little time to wax on about personal projects.\nAnd although the show is peppered with GSM interference for the first few minutes its not actually a clue for the Whats That Sound. (Elliot says sorry!\u00a0 And edited most it out by swapping over to the backup recording for most of the rest of the show.)\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in the comments!\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\nDownload it yourself if thats your jam.\n\nEpisode 236 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nReview: Battery Spot Welders, Why You Should Buy A Proper Spot Welder\nHeres a very complicated Hoverboard Bobbycar mod\nIts all Dans fault: Ask Hackaday: What\u2019s Your \u201cTactical Tool\u201d Threshold?\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nGuess the sound for a chance to win a Podcast T-shirt!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nYour Car Is A Privacy Nightmare On Wheels\nWhen Tail Lights Lose Touch With Reality\nOut With The Circus Animals, In With The Holograms\n\nVolumetric OLED Display Shows Bladerunner Vibe, Curious Screen Tech\n3D Printed Helix Displays Graphics In 3D\nWiremap\n\n\nTape Is Very, Very Quiet\n[Thomas Sanladerer]\u2019s YouTube Channel Goes In The Toilet\nBringing Da Vinci\u2019s Saw Mill To Life\n\nMill  David Macaulay  Google Books\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nA Virus For The BBC Micro\nBuilding A Cargo Bike Dream\nPutting The Magic Smoke Back Into A Dodgy Spectrum Analyzer\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nHow Small Can The ESP32 Get?\nClock Hack Gives DEC Rainbow A New Lease On Life\nThe Computer That Controlled Chernobyl\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nWill RadioShack Return?\n\nThe Return Of RadioShack?\nForrest Mims, Radio Shack, And The Notebooks That Launched A Thousand Careers\n\n\n\n\nRoad Salt?

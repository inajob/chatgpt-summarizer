(Credit: Zerobrain, YouTube)\nEver since the invention of washing machines, the process of doing laundry has become rather straightforward. Simply toss the dirty laundry into the machine, fill up the detergent, and let the preset program handle the rest. This of course has not prevented companies from coming up with ways to add more complexity to doing laundry, with Henkels Smartwash technology the latest example, as demonstrated by German YouTube channel [ZeroBrain] with a complete teardown.\nHenkel is the owner of detergent brands like Persil and Somat, with the Smartwash ball supposedly offering smart dosing of detergent for washing machines, with naturally a smartphone app with intrusive localization to personalize the laundry experience. Sadly the video is only in German, but the language of teardowns is universal.\n\nBefore the teardown, the device got tested as intended, with the video showing how to put the detergent with its special pod inside the device. The device then got connected to WiFi, followed by it performing the typical IoT firmware update. After half an hour [Zerobrain] was finally ready to do the laundry. During the washing cycle the 441 gram heavy ball audibly bounced inside the machine, though the rubber outside covering should prevent damage.\nThe IP68-rated internals are clearly not designed to be easily opened, requiring a certain level of violence to correct for this oversight. Eventually the internals are revealed, showing the inductive charging coil, controls pad and main PCB, along with a pump for the double-chambered detergent pod and a bunch of sensors dangling at the end of flexible PCBs.\nThe Persil Smartwash fully disassembled. (Credit: Zerobrain, YouTube)\nInterestingly, the heart of the main PCB is an ESP32-D0WD-V3, flanked by an ESP-PSRAMH 64 Mbit pseudo-static RAM. For charging the Li-ion cell a TP4056 is used, while a T3168 handles the wireless (Qi) power side of things. As for sensors, there are two Hall effect sensors that seem to be used to measure how much detergent and softener are being excreted by the pump.\nWhat is fascinating is that it uses a single pump to pump both types of fluids independently from each other. There also appears to be a presence sensor to detect the presence of a pod, and some of the other ICs on the PCB may be an IMU to detect motion of the ball, but as hinted at in the accompanying app, you are still supposed to know the hardness of the local water supply and punch in the same details like laundry dirtiness that youd normally read off the label on the detergent and softener packaging.\n\nThanks to [Jan Pr\u00e4gert] for the tip.\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u6d17\u6fef\u4f53\u9a13\uff1aSmartwash\u6280\u8853\u306e\u89e3\u4f53", "body": "\u6d17\u6fef\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u3001Henkel\u306eSmartwash\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u9023\u643a\u3067\u6d17\u5264\u3092\u6700\u9069\u306b\u6295\u4e0e\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u6d17\u6fef\u4f53\u9a13\uff1aSmartwash\u6280\u8853\u306e\u89e3\u4f53", "- Henkel\u306eSmartwash\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u6d17\u5264\u6295\u4e0e\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3059\u308bIoT\u6280\u8853\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- ESP32\u3068\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fSmartwash\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6d17\u6fef\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5316\uff1a\u5b9f\u8df5\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc"]}

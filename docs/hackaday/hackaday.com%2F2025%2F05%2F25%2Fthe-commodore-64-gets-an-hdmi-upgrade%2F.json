It doesnt have HDMI! That makes it a total pain to use with modern displays. Thankfully, [Side Projects Lab] has whipped up an HDMI output board to solve this concerning oversight from the original designers.\nThe project was inspired by work by [Copper Dragon], who whipped up a nifty RGB output board. This device worked by reading the inputs to the C64s VIC II graphics chip, which it then used to recreate a pixel-perfect video frames to then produce a quality analog video output. [Side Projects Lab] figured the same interception technique would be useful for producing a quality HDMI output.\nThe result was the HD-64. It sits inside the C64 in place of the original RF modulator. It uses an interleaver socket to capture digital signals going to the VIC II. It then feeds these signals to an emulated VIC II running inside an FPGA, which creates the pixel-perfect screen representation and synthesizes the proper digital HDMI output. Meanwhile, the analog audio output from the SID chip is captured from the RF modulators original header, and sent out via the HDMI output as well. The default output is super-sharp, but the device can be configured to allow scanlines and anti-aliasing if thats more to your tastes.\nIf you want to hook your C64 up to a modern screen, this is going to be one of the tidiest and sharpest ways to do it. Weve seen similar hacks for other platforms before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to RobIII for the tip!]", "title": "- \u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb 64\u306eHDMI\u51fa\u529b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cHD-64\u300d\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u306bHDMI\u51fa\u529b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cHD-64\u300d\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb 64\u306eHDMI\u51fa\u529b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cHD-64\u300d\u767b\u5834", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3078\uff01C64\u7528HDMI\u5909\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u518d\u73fe\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u305fC64\u7528HDMI\u6539\u9020", "- \u8fd1\u4ee3\u7684\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01C64\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6620\u50cf\u51fa\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30a2\u30f3\u30c1\u30a8\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u3082\u9078\u3079\u308bHDMI\u5909\u63db\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

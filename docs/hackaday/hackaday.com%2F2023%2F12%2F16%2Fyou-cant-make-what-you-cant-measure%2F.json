For me, it\u2019s probably a multimeter, although that\u2019s maybe a tie with my oscilloscope. Maybe after that, the soldering iron and wire strippers, or my favorite forceps. Calipers must rate in there somewhere too, but maybe a little further down. Still, the top place, and half of my desert-island top-10, go to measuring gear.\nThat\u2019s because any debugging, investigation, or experimentation always starts with getting some visibility on the problem. And the less visible the physical quantity, the more necessary to tool. For circuits, that means figuring out where all the voltages lie, and you obviously can\u2019t just guess there. A couple months ago, I was doing some epoxy and fiberglass work, and needed to draw a 1/2 atmosphere vacuum. That\u2019s not the kind of quantity you can just eyeball. You need the right measurement tool.\nA few weeks ago, I wrote about my disappointment in receiving a fan that wouldn\u2019t push my coffee beans around in the homemade roaster. How could I have avoided this debacle? By figuring out the pressure differential needed and buying a fan that\u2019s appropriately rated. But I lacked pressure and flow meters.\nNow that I think about it, I could have scavenged the pressure meter from the fiberglassing rig, and given that a go, but with the cheap cost of sensors and amplifiers, I\u2019ll probably just purpose-build something. I\u2019m still not sure how I\u2019ll measure the flow; maybe I\u2019ll just cheese out and buy a cheap wind-speed meter.\nWhen people think of tools, they mostly think of the \u201cdoers\u201d: the wrenches and the hammers of this world. But today, let\u2019s all raise a calibrated 350 ml glass to the \u201cmeasurers\u201d. Without you, we\u2019d be wandering around in the dark.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

But what about with your hacker friends? We came upon an old favorite the other day: whether it \u201ccounts\u201d as retrocomputing if you\u2019re running a simulated version of the system or if it \u201cneeds\u201d to run on old iron.\nThis lovely C64esque laptop sparked the controversy. It\u2019s an absolute looker, with a custom keyboard and a retro-reimagining-period-correct flaptop design, but the beauty is only skin deep: the guts are a Raspberry Pi 5 running VICE. An emulator! Horrors!\nWe\u2019ll admit to being entirely torn. There\u2019s something about the old computers that\u2019s very nice to lay hands on, and we just don\u2019t get the same feels from an emulator running on our desktop. But a physical reproduction like with many of the modern C64 recreations, or [Oscar Vermeulen]\u2019s PiDP-8/I really floats our boat in a way that an in-the-browser emulation experience simply doesn\u2019t.\nAnother example was the Voja 4, the Supercon 2022 badge based on a CPU that never existed. It\u2019s not literally retro, because [Voja Antonics] designed it during the COVID quarantines, so there\u2019s no \u201cold iron\u201d at all. Worse, it\u2019s emulated; the whole thing exists as a virtual machine inside the onboard PIC.\nBut we\u2019d argue that this badge brought more people something very much like the authentic PDP-8 experience, or whatever. We saw people teaching themselves to do something functional in an imaginary 4-bit machine language over a weekend, and we know folks who\u2019ve kept at it in the intervening years. Part of the appeal was that it reflected nearly everything about the machine state in myriad blinking lights. Or rather, it reflected the VM running on the PIC, because remember, it\u2019s all just a trick.\nSo we\u2019ll fittingly close this newsletter with a holiday message of peace to the two retrocomputing camps: Maybe you\u2019re both right. Maybe the physical device and its human interfaces do matter \u2013 emulation sucks \u2013 but maybe it\u2019s not entirely relevant what\u2019s on the inside of the box if the outside is convincing enough. After all, if we hadn\u2019t done [Kevin Noki] dirty by showing the insides of his C64 laptop, maybe nobody would ever have known.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

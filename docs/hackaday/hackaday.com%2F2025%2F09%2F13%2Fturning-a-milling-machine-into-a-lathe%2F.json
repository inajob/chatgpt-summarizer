Nevertheless, this was [Anthony Zhang]\u2019s experience. Admittedly, the milling machines manufacturer sells a conversion kit, which greatly simplifies the more obviously difficult steps, but getting it to cut threads automatically took a few hacks.\nThe conversion started with a secondhand Taig MicroMill 2019DSL CNC mill, which was well-priced enough to be purchased specifically for conversion into a lathe. Taig\u2019s conversion kit includes the spindle, tool posts, mounting hardware, and other necessary parts, and the modifications were simple enough to take only a few hours of disassembly and reassembly. The final lathe reuses the motors and control electronics from the CNC, and the milling motor drives the spindle through a set of pulleys. The Y-axis assembly isn\u2019t used, but the X- and Z-axes hold the tool post in front of the spindle.\nThe biggest difficulty was in getting the spindle indexing sensor working, which was essential for cutting accurate threads. [Anthony] started with Taig\u2019s sensor, but there was no guarantee that it would work with the mill\u2019s motor controller, since it was designed for a lathe controller. Rather than plug it in and hope it worked, he ended up disassembling both the sensor and the controller to reverse-engineer the wiring.\nHe found that it was an inductive sensor which detected a steel insert in the spindle\u2019s pulley, and that a slight modification to the controller would let the two work together. In the end, however, he decided against using it, since it would have taken up the controller\u2019s entire I/O port. Instead, [Anthony] wired his own I/O connector, which interfaces with a commercial inductive sensor and the end-limit switches. A side benefit was that the new indexing sensor\u2019s mounting didn\u2019t block moving the pulley\u2019s drive belt, as the original had.\nThe end result was a small, versatile CNC lathe with enough accuracy to cut useful threads with some care. If you aren\u2019t lucky enough to get a Taig to convert, there are quite a few people who\u2019ve built their own CNC lathes, ranging from relatively simple to the extremely advanced.", "title": "CNC\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u76e4\u3092\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u65cb\u76e4\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "body": "CNC\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u76e4\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u65cb\u76e4\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u6700\u3082\u96e3\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["CNC\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u76e4\u3092\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u65cb\u76e4\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "\u7cbe\u5bc6\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u52a0\u5de5\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc  ", "Taig MicroMill\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65cb\u76e4\u3078\u306e\u6539\u9020\u6cd5  ", "\u81ea\u4f5cCNC\u65cb\u76e4\u3067\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u3042\u308b\u52a0\u5de5\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080  ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u6311\u3080\u3001CNC\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u6539\u9020\u3068\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u5de5\u592b  "]}

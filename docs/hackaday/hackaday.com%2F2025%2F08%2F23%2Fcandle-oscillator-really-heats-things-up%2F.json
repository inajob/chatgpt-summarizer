Traditionally, that meant a pendulum, but in our time, weve seen plenty of others. Perhaps none as unusual as [Tim]s candle flicker clock, though.\nCandles are known for their flickering, a property of the wick and the fuel supply that candle manufacturers have gone to great lengths to mitigate. If you bring several of them together, they will have a significant flicker, with a surprisingly consistent 9.9 Hz frequency. This is the timebase for the clock, with the capacitance of the flame being sensed by a wire connected to a CH32 microcontroller, and processed to produce the required timing.\nWe like this project, and consider it a shame that its not an entry in our One Hertz Challenge.\u00a0 Oddly, though, its not the first candle-based oscillator weve seen; they can even be turned into active electronic devices.", "title": "- \u874b\u71ed\u306e\u63fa\u3089\u304e\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08", "body": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u63fa\u3089\u304e\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u874b\u71ed\u306e\u63fa\u3089\u304e\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08", "- 9.9 Hz\u306e\u5468\u671f\u3092\u6301\u3064\u874b\u71ed\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u708e\u306e\u5bb9\u91cf\u3092\u611f\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u874b\u71ed\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u632f\u52d5\u5b50\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- One Hertz Challenge\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306a\u874b\u71ed\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

Traditionally, that meant a pendulum, but in our time, weve seen plenty of others. Perhaps none as unusual as [Tim]s candle flicker clock, though.\nCandles are known for their flickering, a property of the wick and the fuel supply that candle manufacturers have gone to great lengths to mitigate. If you bring several of them together, they will have a significant flicker, with a surprisingly consistent 9.9 Hz frequency. This is the timebase for the clock, with the capacitance of the flame being sensed by a wire connected to a CH32 microcontroller, and processed to produce the required timing.\nWe like this project, and consider it a shame that its not an entry in our One Hertz Challenge.\u00a0 Oddly, though, its not the first candle-based oscillator weve seen; they can even be turned into active electronic devices."}

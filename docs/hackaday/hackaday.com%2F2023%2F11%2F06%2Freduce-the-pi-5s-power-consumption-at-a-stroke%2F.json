One of those quirks is a surprisingly high power consumption when powered down, despite halting the SoC it leaves the power on and consumes over a watt even in standby. [Jeff Geerling has a solution, and its a simple config change.\nIts useful to know how to fix this and were indebted to him for finding it, but its hardly the most complex of hacks. Where the interest lies is in why the board leaves the lights turned on when nobodys at home in the first place. It seems that some HATs have an issue when the 3V3 rail shuts down but the 5V rail doesnt. The Raspberry Pi foundation took the most compatible route and kept the rails on all the time. Perhaps future OS releases will come up with something more elegant, but at least there *is* a fix.\nIf youre new to the Pi 5, you can take a look at our review of a preview model, and see why its the closest yet to a usable everyday PC that theyve produced.", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30aa\u30d5\u6642\u306e\u9ad8\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5207\u3063\u305f\u6642\u3067\u3082\u610f\u5916\u306b\u9ad8\u3044\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002Jeff Geerling\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5909\u66f4\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u306eOS\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002Pi 5\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044PC\u306b\u8fd1\u3065\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30aa\u30d5\u6642\u306e\u9ad8\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5207\u3063\u3066\u3082\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u554f\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5909\u66f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\uff1aHAT\u304c\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u6642\u306b\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u70b9\u706f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u4ed5\u69d8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4 5 \u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff1a\u65e5\u5e38\u7684\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308bPC\u306b\u6700\u3082\u8fd1\u3044\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

For electricity, a solar array or a generator is fairly common. The Internet can similarly be accessed via a satellite link if wires arent available. For water, most people will drill a well, but that gets similarly expensive. [Cranktown City] recently bought an off-grid home and needed a way to get water to it on a budget, so he built this water trailer instead.\n\nThe trailer started off as a standard single-axle utility trailer. The weight rating was probably around 3,500 pounds or 1588 kg. A few support structures were welded in. The supports serve double duty as a frame for two IBC totes, which can hold about 550 gallons or 2082 liters of water. The trailer also got upgraded wiring, including some extra wires to support a backup camera. The two totes were then plumbed together with a ball valve for an outlet. That valve was mated to a motor that can be remotely activated from within a truck to dump the water out into a cistern.\nOn the cistern side, [Cranktown City] welded up a door with a linear actuator and a remote control. When hes ready to dump the water into the cistern, he can easily back up the trailer using the backup camera, open the door to the cistern remotely, and then activate the ball valve on the trailer to start filling the reservoir. Its a clever solution to bringing water to his off-grid property at a fraction of the cost of a drilled well. Weve seen some other unique ways to live off-grid as well,\u00a0 like this hydroelectric generator, which might offset the cost of an expensive solar array.\n"}

If you think you can identify the sound amid all the talking, you could win a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt!\nAfter that, its on to the hacks and such, beginning with a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation when it comes to a pair of formerly-cloud music players. We take a look at a crazy keyboard hack, some even crazier conductive string, and a perfectly cromulent list of 70 DIY synths on one wild webpage. Finally, we rethink body art with LEDs, and take a look at a couple of printing techniques that are a hundred years or so apart in their invention.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 315 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nNo news is good news!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCan you figure it out?\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nOpen Source Framework Aims To Keep Tidbyt Afloat\nCan Hackers Bring Jooki Back To Life?\n\nReddit  The heart of the internet\n\n\nDIY Split Keyboard Made With A Saw\n70 DIY Synths On One Webpage\nProgrammer\u2019s Macro Pad Bangs Out Whole Functions\nSupercon 2024: Rethinking Body Art With LEDs\nMake DIY Conductive, Biodegradable String Right In Your Kitchen\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nThe Magic Touch: A 555 Touch Switch\nHandheld 18650 Analyzer Scopes Out Salvaged Cells\nThe Lowly Wall Wart Laid Bare\nA Forgotten Photographic Process Characterised\nPictures From A High Altitude Balloon\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\nAn ESP32 Pomodoro Timer\nYaydio, A Music Player For Kids\nAn Elegant Writer For A More Civilized Age\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nZink Is Zero Ink \u2014 Sort Of\nDitto That\n"}

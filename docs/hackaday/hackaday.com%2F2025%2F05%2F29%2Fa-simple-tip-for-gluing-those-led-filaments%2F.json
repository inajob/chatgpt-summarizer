Thats neat and all, but what we really want to highlight is a simple tip [Boylei] shares about working with these filament strips: how to glue them.\nGlue doesnt stick to LED filament strips, so put on a small piece of heat-shrink and glue to that instead.\nThe silicone (or silicone-like) coating on these LED filament strips means glue simply doesnt stick. To work around this, [Boylei] puts a piece of clear heat shrink around the filament, and glues to that instead. If you want a visual, you can see him demonstrate at 6:11. Its a simple and effective tip thats certainly worth keeping in mind, especially since filament strips invite so many project ideas.\nWhen LED filament strips first hit the hobbyist market they were attractive, but required high operating voltages. Nowadays they are not only cheaper, but work at battery-level voltages and come in a variety of colors.\nThese filaments have only gotten easier to work with over the years. Just remember to be gentle about bending them, and as [Boylei] demonstrates, a little piece of clear shrink tubing is all it takes to provide a versatile glue anchor. So if you had a project idea involving them that didnt quite work out in the past, maybe its time to give it another go?\n\n"}

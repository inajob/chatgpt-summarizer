Where things get really interesting is the assembly that rides on the Z-axis, which [Joshua] calls a Core R-Theta mechanism. Its an apt description, since as in a CoreXY motion system, it uses a pair of stepper motors and a continuous timing belt to achieve two axes of movement. However, rather than two linear axes, the motors can team up to move the whole print arm in and out along the radius of the build platform while also rotating the print head through almost 90 degrees.\nThe kinematic possibilities with this setup are really interesting. With the print head rotated perpendicular to the bed, it acts like a simple polar printer. But tilting the head allows you to print steep overhangs with no supports. [Joshua] printed a simple propeller as a demo, with the hub printed more or less traditionally while the blades are added with the head at steeper and steeper angles. As you can imagine, slicing is a bit of a mind-bender, and there are some practical problems such as print cooling, which [Joshua] addresses by piping in compressed air. Youll want to see this in action, so check out the video below.\nThis is a fantastic bit of work, and hats off to [Joshua] for working through all the complexities to bring us the first really new thing weve seen in 3D printing is a long time.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson], [grythumn],\u00a0 [Hari Wiguna], and [MrSVCD] for the near-simultaneous tips on this one."}

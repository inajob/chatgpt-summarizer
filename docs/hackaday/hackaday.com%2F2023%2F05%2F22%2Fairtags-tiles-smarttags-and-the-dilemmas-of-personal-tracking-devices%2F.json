Since we do not live in this ideal world, we have had to come up with ways to keep track of our belongings, whether inside or outside our homes, which has led to todays ubiquitous personal tracking devices.\nTodays popular Bluetooth-based trackers constantly announce their presence to devices set up to listen for them. Within a home, this range is generally enough to find the tracker and associated item using a smartphone, after which using special software the tracker can be made to sound its built-in speaker to ease localizing it by ear. Outside the home, these trackers can use mesh networks formed by smartphones and other devices to phone home to paired devices.\nThis is great when its your purse. But this also gives anyone the ability to stick such a tracker device onto a victims belongings and track them without their consent, for whatever nefarious purpose. Yet it is this duality between useful and illegal that has people on edge when it comes to these trackers. How can we still use the benefits they offer, without giving stalkers and criminals free reign? A\u00a0draft proposal by Apple and Google, submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), seeks to address these points\u00a0but it remains complicated.\n\nGame Of Tag\nThe first range of Bluetooth-based personal tracking devices that popularized tracking ones belongings using these devices came from Tile, with the release of their Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0-based trackers. These were marketed for keeping track of ones keys, a backpack and similar easy to lose items, with an associated smartphone app being used to detect the tracker within a range of about 30 meters. The second generation also added a find my phone feature where pressing a button on the Tile tracker causes the paired smartphone to make a noise.\nCurrent Tile trackers feature a crowd GPS feature, whereby a reported-as-lost Tile tracker coming within reach of any smartphone running the Tile app will result in the location being anonymously sent to the owner. While quite popular, it wasnt until the Apple AirTag was released in April of 2021 that suddenly personal tracking devices appeared everywhere. The AirTags use the ubiquitous Apple Find My network that is powered by the about one billion Apple devices around the globe. Meanwhile the Samsung SmartThings Find network is used for its Galaxy SmartTags tracker devices.\nThese devices only function fully within their own ecosystem. AirTags can only be paired with Apple devices, and Samsung SmartTags only gain access to SmartThings Find where Samsung smartphones are involved. Although the BLE communication is universal and allows any BLE-enabled device to at least see the trackers advertising their ID, recent features such as precise localizing via ultra-wideband (UWB) communication  using e.g. Apples U1 chip in iPhones  is less universal, just like access to the trackers built-in speaker and stored (NFC) information.\nScreenshots of Apples Tracker Detect app for Android, demonstrating tracking and AirTag disabling instructions. (Credit: Apple)\nThus the bad news is that for example an AirTag can only be tracked while it is in range of Apple devices configured to listen for AirTags and will essentially vanish the moment its out of range. The good news is that you have to travel to pretty remote locations to get out of range of any and all Apple devices and never get near pockets of civilization again to make an AirTag go fully AWOL. If you, on the other hand, have an Android device, your only recourse to locate nearby AirTags is using the Tracker Detect app. Similarly, if you use a Samsung SmartTag or Tile, you need their app.\nWith Apple devices featuring so prominently, it is perhaps little surprise that AirTags also see the most use outside of regular legitimate uses. Recently, for example, the New York Policy Department has been giving out free AirTags to residents which they can hide in their cars, as a way to address rising car theft. If the car gets stolen, then the AirTag should theoretically lead the NYPD straight to whats left of the car in the chop shop, or maybe even the intact vehicle and highly embarrassed thieves.\nNaturally, everything that can be used for good can and will be used for evil, which is where the privacy aspects come into play.\nTag Warfare\nA kind of weapons race has been taking place between those who would abuse these cheap and powerful tracking devices and those who are at risk of becoming a victim of such abuse. The commonly cited example of stalking is one of these, but another one involves the exact inverse of tracking down stolen cars, in the form of car thieves tagging targets with an AirTag while the vehicle is in a public area, so that they can steal it later when its in a more secluded area.\nAirTag innards, exposing the PCB and voice coil. (Credit: iFixit)\nSo how do you make a tracking device into not-a-tracking-device when it shouldnt be one? How could you make a set of rules to tell these situations apart? In the draft that Google and Apple engineers submitted to the IETF, they propose a number of requirements that they hope will ensure legal tracker use.\nThe primary suggestion is to force the tracker to emit noise with its speaker when requested by a person who thinks that theyre being tracked, generally the person who got a warning about an unknown AirTag. The essential problem here is that anyone who has nefarious intentions will likely disable the speaker, along with any vibration motors, LEDs and similar features which are listed in the draft. As the AirTag teardown and those of similar devices by the folk over at iFixit makes abundantly clear, these devices are not hard to disassemble, and disabling the speaker very straightforward, while AirTag clones can conceivably work around Apples privacy checks. Wed say that any reasonable anti-tracking measures should be based around the assumption that the tracker is mute and has no functioning fallbacks.\nFortunately, not all hope is lost. Unlike dedicated surveillance trackers, AirTags are fairly easy to track because they communicate primarily via Bluetooth (BLE). By standardizing the information made available via BLE and possibly NFC,\u00a0 a subset of information could be made available to anyone.\u00a0 This could be used to identify the owner even when the tracker is not put into lost mode, using details like a partial email address or phone number. This kind of standardization could at the very least seriously cut back the complexity of keeping track of unwanted trackers without juggling half a dozen apps on ones smartphone.\nIts a shame that the draft does not mention UWB, even though this would probably be the easiest way to locate a tracker, while also being the hardest to circumvent  involving more work than simply ripping out a speaker. The draft does spend some time on a near-owner and separated mode, which would affect what information would be broadcast, but its hard to tell what the exact impact of this might be.\nExisting Fixes\nOne might be excused for thinking that there currently exist no real attempts to reign in abuse of these tracking devices, but this isnt entirely correct. Apple has detailed instructions on how to set up an Apple iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch so that you receive alerts when a likely unwanted tracking device is moving with you. After receiving an alert, the offending tracker can then be located either by sound, or if the i-device has UWB, by localizing its UWB signal.\nMeanwhile on the Tile side of the fence, the company has taken a polar opposite approach to Apple with its Anti-Theft mode. Essentially in this mode Tile trackers are rendered invisible to the Scan and Secure feature of the Tile app, with the reasoning that this way thieves can not detect the tracker. Although this would seem to invite every possible abuse, the company will perform an intense ID verification on the requesting user, linking their real-life identity to all of their tracking devices and threatening with massive fines should anyone abuse the system despite this.\nGoogle is at the table here because they are rumored to launch their own personal tracking devices soon, with similar specifications to AirTags. These would use Googles Android-based Find My Device network, and the possibility of some level of interoperability between all these tracking devices by itself is not a terrible idea.\nMaking Water Not Wet\nSomething as simple as a knife can be a very useful tool, but also a murder weapon. A Bluetooth tracking device can help you locate your lost luggage, but also lead to a harrowing confrontation with a stalker or get your car stolen. The problem is that even with added technology a tracking device doesnt know the intent of the user.\nUntil we get to a point where a tracker will respond to an unscrupulous owner with an Im sorry, Dave, I cannot let you do that. we have to accept that silicon cant solve everything. Were not hopeful for Apple and Googles all-technology solution to this dynamic problem  a problem so thorny that it almost makes us forget that all of this began because we just wanted to a good way to keep tabs on our keys and backpack.", "title": "Bluetooth\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8ffd\u8de1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u304c\u9032\u3080\u3000\u301c\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3001AirTag\u3001Galaxy SmartTag\u3068\u306f\u301c", "body": "\u500b\u4eba\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4fdd\u7ba1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u8003\u3048\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u304c\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u91cd\u8996\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002Apple\u3084Google\u3082\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u63d0\u6848\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u554f\u984c\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u5584\u826f\u306a\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u60aa\u610f\u304c\u3042\u308b\u76ee\u7684\u306e\u4e21\u65b9\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u61f8\u5ff5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Bluetooth\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8ffd\u8de1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u304c\u9032\u3080\u3000\u301c\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3001AirTag\u3001Galaxy SmartTag\u3068\u306f\u301c", "\u8ffd\u8de1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u969b\u3057\u3066\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u76d7\u96e3\u9632\u6b62\u306b\u3082\u6d3b\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01", "\u58f0\u3084\u632f\u52d5\u3001LED\u306a\u3069\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u8ffd\u8de1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u3069\u3046\u5bfe\u51e6\u3059\u308b\u304b", "\u8ffd\u8de1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u629c\u672c\u7684\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u306f\u307e\u3060\u898b\u3064\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\uff1f\u3000\u301c\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3068\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u73fe\u5b9f\u301c"]}

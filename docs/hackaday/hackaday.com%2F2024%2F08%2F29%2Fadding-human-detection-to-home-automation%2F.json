Radio waves of all frequencies can be used for radar as well, whether thats detecting ships beyond the horizon, tracking aircraft near an airport, penetrating the ground, or imaging objects with a high resolution. At the millimeter wavelength its fairly easy to detect humans with the right hardware, and using some inexpensive radar modules [Tech Dregs] shows us how to add this capability a home automation system.\nSince these modules arent trying to image humans with fine detail or detect them at long range, the hardware can be fairly inexpensive. [Tech Dregs] is using the LD2410B modules which have not only an on-board microcontroller but also have the radio antennas used for radar built right onto the PCB. They have a simple binary output which can communicate whether or not a human is detected, but theres also UART for communicating more details about what the module senses in the room. [Tech Dregs] is using this mode to connect the modules to Home Assistant, where they will be used to help automate his homes lighting.\nThe only significant problem he had setting these modules up was getting them built into an enclosure. The short wavelengths used in this type of radar module dont penetrate solid objects very well at all, so after trying to hide one behind an e-ink screen he eventually settled on hollowing out a space in a bezel with very thin plastic between the module and the room. If you need more out of your radar modules than object detection, though, you can always try building a pulse compression radar which can provide much more accurate ranging of objects.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306e\u96fb\u6ce2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9060\u304f\u306e\u8239\u306e\u691c\u51fa\u3001\u7a7a\u6e2f\u8fd1\u304f\u306e\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e\u8ffd\u8de1\u3001\u5730\u4e2d\u3078\u306e\u6d78\u900f\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u89e3\u80fd\u306e\u7269\u4f53\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u306a\u3069\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002LD2410B\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u6295\u8cc7\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3001\u7167\u660e\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u4eba\u9593\u691c\u51fa", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u5727\u7e2e\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

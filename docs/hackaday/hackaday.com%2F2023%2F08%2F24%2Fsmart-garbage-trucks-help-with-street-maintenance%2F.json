It can be incredibly difficult just to track down the right avenue to report issues, let alone get them sorted in a timely fashion.\nIn the suburban streets of one Australian city, though, thats changing somewhat. New smart garbage trucks are becoming instruments of infrastructure surveillance, serving a dual purpose that could reshape urban management. Naturally, though, this new technology raises issues around ethics and privacy.\n\nTrucks With Eyes\nOne of the garbage trucks operating in Melbournes western suburbs.

Thus, its no surprise that the project was a collaborative effort between Swinburne University and Brimbank City Council. At the heart of this system are high-resolution cameras affixed to garbage trucks. As these vehicles traverse the city, they\u00a0 continuously stream video data of their surroundings. This data is then subjected to analysis by AI algorithms, designed to detect and identify anomalies like damaged road signs and battered bus shelters.\nDuring a two-week trial in Melbournes western suburbs, the system transmitted video data over the 5G mobile network. Realistically, though, the project would function just fine with lesser infrastructure, too. Over a 9 hour shift, a single truck would stream roughly 5 GB of data, a rate that even 3G cellular networks could readily achieve. The fleet of 11 trucks covered a roughly 123 square-kilometer area during the period of the trial.\nThe key value of this technology is that it gives Brimbank City Council a continuously-updated picture of the state of its physical infrastructure. Instead of waiting for reports from aggrieved residents, it regularly gets updates as to the state of the city every time a garbage truck heads out on its route. The system is capable of automatically identifying the location of damaged assets in need of repair. Its easy to imagine the system being set up to automatically task maintenance teams to tackle problems as they arise.\nTheres an undeniable efficiency in leveraging garbage trucks, which are already navigating the streets, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated inspection teams. I This not only streamlines the process but reduces redundancy. Moreover, with the immediacy of real-time data analysis, issues are addressed faster, ensuring swift and efficient upkeep of the citys infrastructure. This offers the opportunity to solve issues before they are even raised by locals irate about their crumbling playground or missing bus stop. Plus, from a financial perspective, less reliance on inspection crews equates to tangible savings, making the entire process more cost-effective.\nI Love Big Brother\nYet, for all its merits, the technology doesnt come without concerns. Central to these apprehensions is the phenomenon of scope creep, where data is used beyond its initial intended purpose. As these omnipresent cameras capture everything in their vicinity, they unintentionally amass data, such as vehicle number plates or images of unsuspecting pedestrians. This data, once captured, is ripe for the picking. Just as authorities have leapt on Ring cameras and other home cameras as a source of intelligence, its easy to assume the same would be true here.\nRegular trash pickups provide a neat opportunity for councils to conduct regular inspections of city infrastructure.

By and large, humans in the developed world have become used to ever-present surveillance in public spaces, such as supermarkets, shopping malls, and public parks. Having\u00a0 surveillance cameras regularly running through residential neighbourhoods is another thing entirely. Many would prefer their activities at home go uncaptured, even from the street. At the same time, someone with a lost pet or stolen bike might be champing at the bit to use the footage for their own benefit. The positive use cases are as numerous as the negative ones. The problem is, once the technology is implemented and the data is captured, the genie is out of the bottle. The data will be used as authorities decide is appropriate. Thats seldom in line with any one individuals opinion of whats right.\nThe research paper considers this factor, and lays out a deep and rich framework for ethical use of AI. Its valuable work, though as always, is subject to human foibles. As much as a systems designers might aim to avoid scope creep and misuse of their technology, and even codify those aims on paper, ultimately, humans will do what humans will do.\nIn conclusion, the project shows the potential of simple machine learning systems to automate humdrum everyday tasks. Its easy to see that any council would appreciate the value of such a system.\u00a0 However, it also serves as a potent reminder of the need to tread carefully, ensuring that in our quest for government efficiency, we dont compromise on ethics or privacy. Whether any local government can claim to achieve that is yet to be seen.", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u90fd\u5e02\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u3092\u76e3\u8996\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u884c\u653f\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u305f\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u90fd\u5e02\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306e\u7570\u5e38\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u5831\u544a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3060\u304c\u3001\u502b\u7406\u3084\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u90fd\u5e02\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u3092\u76e3\u8996\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u884c\u653f\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30ebIoT-RoadBot\uff1a\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8857\u8def\u76e3\u8996\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\uff1f\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306a\u76e3\u8996\u304c\u6301\u3064\u61f8\u5ff5", "\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u8857\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306e\u72b6\u6cc1\u3092\u9023\u7d9a\u7684\u306b\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u8857\u8def\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066", "\u30b4\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u8857\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u691c\u51fa\uff1a\u5c02\u9580\u306e\u8abf\u67fb\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u76e3\u8996\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

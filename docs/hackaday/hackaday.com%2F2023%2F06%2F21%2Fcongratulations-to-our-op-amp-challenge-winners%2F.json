We wanted to give you analog fanatics out there a chance to shine and to encourage our digital brothers and sisters to dip their toes in the murky waters where ones and zeroes define the ends of a spectrum rather than representing the only choice. Hence, we presented the Op Amp Challenge. And you did not disappoint!\nWe received 83 entries, and it was extraordinarily hard to pick the winners. But since we had three $150 DigiKey shopping sprees to give away, our six judges buckled down and picked their favorites. Whether or not you\u2019ve got the Golden Rules of the ideal op-amp tattooed on your arm, you\u2019ll enjoy looking through all of the projects here. But without further ado\u2026\nThe Winners\n[Craig]\u2019s Op Art is an X-Y voltage generator to plug into an oscilloscope and make classic Lissajous and other spirograph-like images, and it\u2019s all done in analog. Maybe it was his incredible documentation, the nice use of a classic three-op-amp tunable oscillator, or the pun hidden in the title. Whatever the case, it wowed our judges and picked up a deserved place in the top three.\nHearkening back to the pre-digital dinosaur days, [Rainer Glaschick]\u2019s Flexible Analog Computer is a modular analog computer prototyping system on a breadboard backplane. Since you have to re-wire up an analog computer for your particular, it\u2019s great that [Rainer] gave us a bunch of examples on his website as well, including a lunar lander and classic Lorenz attractor demos.\nAnd there was no way that [Chris]\u2019s interactive analog LED wave array wouldn\u2019t place in the top three. It\u2019s a huge 2D analog simulation that runs entirely on op-amps, sensing when your hand moves across any part of its surface and radiating waves out from there. You have to admire the massive scale here, and you simply must check out the video of it in action. Glorious!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonorable Mentions\nWe wanted to give you plenty of room to strut your stuff, whether that was making something classic, something entirely off the wall, or something that would fit on the measurement bench at the metrology department. So here\u2019s a quick rundown of just some of the projects that we thought were worth a look.\nHyper Precise\n[Mark Omo]\u2019s LOCKDOWN is a superb lock-in amplifier design and a great demo and explanation of how one works. Essentially, if the signal you want to measure has a periodic component \u2013 sits on a carrier wave \u2013 then you can use a lock-in amplifier to \u201ctune in\u201d on just the signal, and the non-periodic noise drops right out. This is an amazing build and a shoo-in for the hyper-precise mention. Plus, what a snazzy circuit board!\n[Floydfish]\u2019s ultra-low noise amplifier \u201cTake a \u2018NAP\u2019 and enjoy a moment of silence\u201d is a classic design, but as is always the case with precision builds, a lot depends on the details of how you do it. Here, a copper-clad cage with Mu-metal shielding is put inside a nicely labeled cookie tin to get the job done. The design pushes the chosen precision op-amp to its limits.\n\n\n\n\nOddballs\n[MaBe42]\u2019s circuit sculpture Chaotic Lighthouse struck a chord with our judges, bringing Sprott\u2019s chaos circuit into duty to drive a bunch of LEDs. Make sure you check out the video.\nUntil reading up on [Bruce Land]\u2019s Model nonlinear biochem reactions using opamps, we had no idea what a repressilator was. And honestly, we\u2019re still not sure. But [Bruce] made a purpose-built analog computer to simulate this ring of genes that suppress each other\u2019s expression. Whoah.\nAnd [Jarrett Cigainero]\u2019s ADS-B on a real RADAR CRT only uses a little bit of op-amp to go from the DACs to the screen, but we just love the sweet phosphor glow, so we\u2019re going with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Classics\nOne of the absolute classic op-amp applications is simple signal level scaling, and [David]\u2019s ultra-low-cost pH amplifier circuit for 3.3V MCUs is a great example. [Florian Dirnberger]\u2019s nice Triangle-wave oscillator gets the job done and is very well documented. [555TechLab] implemented a classic 0 V  10 V variable voltage reference with one of the only 741 builds in the whole contest. And if all this op-amp stuff makes you want to know how they work under the hood, check out [Mitsuru Yamada]\u2019s CMOS Homemade Operational Amplifier for a non-traditional take.\nAmazing Analog\nWe haven\u2019t run an analog design contest in years, and we\u2019re guessing that there was a lot of pent-up demand, and we were really floored by the number and quality of entries here. Be sure to check out the big list of contest entries because we\u2019re certain you\u2019ll find something else that strikes your particular funny bone. Don\u2019t get me started on the audio effects, for instance!\nCongratulations to everyone who entered, especially those who took home a prize. And as always, thanks to DigiKey for sponsoring.\n \n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u56de\u8def\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u306e\u512a\u52dd\u8005\u304c\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01", "body": "\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\uff08\u5897\u5e45\u56de\u8def\uff09\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u56de\u8def\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u512a\u52dd\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30023\u4eba\u306e\u512a\u52dd\u5019\u88dc\u304b\u3089\u512a\u308c\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u9078\u3070\u308c\u305f\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u3082\u512a\u308c\u305f\u56de\u8def\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002CMOS Homemade Operational Amplifier\u3084LOCKDOWN\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u4e00\u98a8\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u56de\u8def\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001LED wave array \u306a\u3069\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u56de\u8def\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u306e\u512a\u52dd\u8005\u304c\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u56de\u8def\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u8e0f\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u307f\u305f\u3044\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6d3e\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u3067\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u307e\u3067\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u7cbe\u5bc6\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u8208\u5473\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u56de\u8def\u3092\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u4f5c\u308a\u624b\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u3055\u304c\u8a66\u3055\u308c\u305f\uff01Op Amp Challenge\u5165\u8cde\u56de\u8def\u307e\u3068\u3081"]}

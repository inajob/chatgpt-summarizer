Its most prominent feature is a radome, a huge golf-ball-like structure visible for miles, that protects a large parabolic antenna from the British weather. It makes sense not just for a superpower to protect its antennas from the elements, and [saveitforparts] is doing the same with a geodesic dome for his radio telescope experiments. But what effect does it have on the received signal? Hes made a video to investigate.\nThe US military radome is likely constructed of special RF-transparent materials, but this smaller version has a fibreglass skin and an aluminium frame. When he compares internal and external sky scans made with a small motorised satellite TV antenna he finds that the TV satellites are just as strong, but that the noise floor is higher and the frame is visible in the scan. Its particularly obvious with such small dish, and his planned larger array should improve matters.\nWe would be curious to know whether an offset-fed dish constructed to minimise ground noise reaching the LNB, would improve matters further. Its no surprise that the frame doesnt impede the TV satellites though, as it is many wavelengths wide at that frequency. The video is below the break, and meanwhile, we featured the antenna hes using here in 2023.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u5730\u5c40\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u53ca\u307c\u3059\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578b\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "\u5730\u4e0a\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u885b\u661f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306e\u7d50\u679c", "RF\u900f\u904e\u6750\u6599\u3068\u5c0f\u578b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

However, the vast majority of these components are made out of plastic and are only capable of toy-like levels of performance. In the competitive world of Lego YouTube, builders often push these parts to their limits, breaking them more often than you might think. To that end, [Brick Experiment Channel] has been investigating stouter Lego-compatible universal joints from a variety of third-party manufacturers.\nThe video starts with a simple demonstration, showing that a Lego universal joint pops apart at just 0.4 Nm of torque. Its no surprise, given it relies on tiny plastic pins in snap-fit joints. However, this means that its not that hard to build a stronger universal joint to outperform the stock parts.\nThe video steps through a range of other options available on the market. For example, CaDA builds a universal joint using aluminium sleeves, a copper center, and steel pins to join everything together. Its so strong that the plastic Lego axles fail long before the joint does. Tested with third-party aluminum axles, it eventually fails at 2.3 Nm of torque when the aluminum sleeve snaps. An all-steel joint from MTP goes even harder, eventually stripping out its axle mount at 4 Nm. The rest of the video goes on to explore angular performance, size, and other design features.\nIts fair to say that if youre swapping out universal joints and axles for aluminum steel parts, youre not really playing with Lego anymore. At the same time, its neat that there exists a sort of defacto standard kit for mechanical experimentation that is now being expanded upon with stronger components. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30b4\u30fb\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u5f37\u5316\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "body": "\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u5316\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3002\u5f37\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30b4\u30fb\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u5f37\u5316\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\uff01\u30ec\u30b4\u4e92\u63db\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30ea\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c1\u30e3\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u63a2\u308b\u3001\u9811\u4e08\u306a\u30ec\u30b4\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u3068\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u529b\u3092\u4f53\u611f\uff1a\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30b4\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u5f37\u5316\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

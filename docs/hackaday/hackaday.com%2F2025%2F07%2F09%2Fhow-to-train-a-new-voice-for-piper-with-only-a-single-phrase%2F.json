Not satisfied with the robotic-sounding standard voices available, [Cal] set about an experiment to fine-tune the Piper TTS AI voice model using a clone of a single phrase created by a commercial TTS voice as a starting point.\nBefore the release of Piper TTS in 2023, existing free-to-use TTS systems such as espeak and Festival sounded robotic and flat. Piper delivered much more natural-sounding output, without requiring massive resources to run. To change the voice style, the Piper AI model can be either retrained from scratch or fine-tuned with less effort. In the latter case, the problem to be solved first was how to generate the necessary volume of training phrases to run the fine-tuning of Pipers AI model. This was solved using a heavyweight AI model, ChatterBox, which is capable of so-called zero-shot training. Check out the Chatterbox demo here.\nAs the loss function gets smaller, the models accuracy gets better\nTraining began with a corpus of test phrases in text format to ensure decent coverage of everyday English. [Cal] used ChatterBox to clone audio from a single test phrase generated by a mystery TTS system and created 1,300 test phrases from this new voice. This audio set served as training data to fine-tune the Piper AI model on the lashed-up GPU rig.\nTo verify accuracy, [Cal] used OpenAIs Whisper software to transcribe the audio back to text, in order to compare with the original text corpus. To overcome issues with punctuation and differences between US and UK English, the text was converted into phonemes using espeak-ng, resulting in a 98% phrase matching accuracy.\nAfter down-sampling the training set using SoX, it was ready for the Piper TTS training system. Despite all the preparation, running the software felt anticlimactic. A few inconsistencies in the dataset necessitated the removal of some data points. After five days of training parked outside in the shade due to concerns about heat, TensorBoard indicated that the models loss function was converging. Thats AI-speak for: the model was tuned and ready for action! We think it sounds pretty slick.\nIf all this new-fangled AI speech synthesis is too complex and, well, a bit creepy for you, may we offer a more 1980s solution to making stuff talk? Finally, most people take the ability to speak for granted, until they can no longer do so. Heres a team using cutting-edge AI to give people back that ability.", "title": "- \u81ea\u5b85\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u9769\u65b0\uff01Piper TTS\u306e\u58f0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5fae\u8abf\u6574", "body": "Cal Bryant\u306fPiper TTS\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u58f0\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5b85\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u9769\u65b0\uff01Piper TTS\u306e\u58f0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5fae\u8abf\u6574", "- \u3088\u308a\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305fCal Bryant\u306eTTS\u5b9f\u9a13", "- ChatterBox\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305fPiper TTS\u306eAI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u7d30\u90e8\u8abf\u6574", "- 98%\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u6587\u5b57\u306b\u5909\u63db\uff01Cal\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u6700\u5148\u7aefAI\u3067\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u58f0\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u623b\u3059\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc"]}

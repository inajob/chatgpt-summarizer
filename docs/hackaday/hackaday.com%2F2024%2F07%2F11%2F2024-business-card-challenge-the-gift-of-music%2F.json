If you were to be the lucky recipient of one of [Ayu]s synthesizer business cards, well, then it really couldnt be helped.\nThis tiny, go-anywhere instrument has quite a lot going for it. Its easy for anyone to pick up and play something, but versatile enough that a more experienced musician can add complexity. While we do tend to see twelve keys in a small form-factor like this, the Canta-Cart uses them a bit differently. Only ten are tied to notes, and the other two are for transposition.\n[Ayu] was able to keep the BOM cost way down by using the PY32, which is an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller made by Puya that costs as little as 10\u00a2 each. In fact, the whole BOM clocks in around 60\u00a2 total even with the audio DAC and amplifier ICs, which really makes these ideal to actually give away to people.

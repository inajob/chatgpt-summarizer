Accordingly, the UL Research Institute is working with reverse engineering experts Munro  Associates to characterize EV fires and find the best way to fight them.\nThere is currently some debate in the firefighting community over whether its better to try to put an EV battery fire out with water or to just let it burn. Research like this means the decision doesnt have to fall on only anecdotal evidence. Anyone whos worked in a lab will recognize the mix of exceedingly expensive equipment next to the borderline sketchy rigged up hacks on display, in this case the super nice thermal imagers and a turkey burner on steroids. The video goes through some discussion of the previous results with a Chevy Bolt, Hyundai Kona, Ford Mustang Mach E, and then we get to see them light up a Tesla Model 3. This is definitely one you shouldnt try at home!\nWhile the massive battery banks in modern EVs can pose unique challenges in the event of an accident, that doesnt mean they cant be repurposed to backup your own home.\n\n"}

Many FPGAs have a HDMI (or rather, sparkling DVI) port as well, and [Steve Markgraf] brings us the hsdaoh project  High-Speed Data Acquisition Over HDMI, using USB3 capture cards based on the Macrosilicon MS2130 chipset to get the data from the FPGA right to your PC.\nCurrent FPGA-side implementation is designed for Sipeed Tang chips and the GOWIN toolchain, but it should be portable to an open-source toolchain in the future. Make sure youre using a USB3 capture card with a MS2130 chipset, load the test code into your FPGA, run the userspace capture side, and youre ready to add this interface to your FPGA project! Its well worth it, too  during testing, [Steve] has got data transfer speeds up to 180 MB/s, without the USB3 complexity.\nAs a test, [Steve] shows us an RX-only SDR project using this interface, with respectable amounts of bandwidth. The presentation goes a fair bit into the low-level details of the protocol, from HDMI fundamentals, to manipulating the MS2130 registers in a way that disables all video conversion; do watch the recording, or at least skim the slides! Oh, and if you dont own a capture card yet, you really should, as it makes for a wonderful Raspberry Pi hacking companion in times of need."}

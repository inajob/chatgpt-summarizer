Commodore, Atari, and even Apple had some bizarre machines from this era but for our money, the most unusual systems come out of the Eastern Bloc. Weve featured plenty of these before, and the latest is a Robotron CM1910 which comes to us from [Chernobyl Family] via YouTube.\nBuilt in East Germany behind the wall, the Robotron factories had easier access to Soviet than western parts, but the latter were also available when necessary. Hence its built on an Intel 8086 processor, which seems common enough for the era, but after opening the case some non-standard construction becomes apparent.\nThe first is a densely-packed array of circuit boards and wiring, far beyond what a western PC might have included in this time. This also partially explains its massive 25 kg weight. It does include a hard drive, two floppy disk drives, a large dedicated graphics card, and a modem which all contribute as well. The overall design philosophy of the machine was a headscratcher too, which would have involved near-complete dismantling of the machine to access or repair some of the parts, as well as some hidden peripheral and drive controllers in questionable locations.\nFrom the looks of it, we doubt this computer will see any uptime anytime soon, although they did at least restore the keyboard. With all of the chips accessible on PCBs, it might be possible to get this machine up and running again although it would take a massive effort thanks to its non-standard design and construction, and might also require help from builds like this to replace or emulate some of the hardware.\nThanks to [Stephen] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3CM1910\uff1a\u6771\u5074\u8af8\u56fd\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "body": "70\u5e74\u4ee3\u304b\u308990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u304b\u3051\u3066\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3068\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30e5\u30aa\u30dd\u30ea\u304c\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u3059\u308b\u524d\u306b\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u56de\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001\u6771\u6b27\u304b\u3089\u6765\u305fRobotron CM1910\u3067\u3001\u898f\u683c\u5916\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u3001Intel 8086\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u897f\u6d0b\u306ePC\u3088\u308a\u3082\u306f\u308b\u304b\u306b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u914d\u7dda\u3084\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u89e3\u4f53\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u54f2\u5b66\u306f\u982d\u3092\u60a9\u307e\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3067\u3082\u3001\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u5fa9\u5143\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ed\u30dc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3CM1910\uff1a\u6771\u5074\u8af8\u56fd\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "25kg!! \u30ed\u30dc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3CM1910\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u306f\u4e00\u98a8\u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b", "\u897f\u5074\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3001\u6771\u5074\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u5bc6\u96c6\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3CM1910\uff1a\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u306f\u5927\u304c\u304b\u308a\u306a\u5206\u89e3\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3CM1910\uff1a\u975e\u6a19\u6e96\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u9020\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u518d\u958b\u306f\u56f0\u96e3"]}

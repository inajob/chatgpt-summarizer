Although the EmptyEpsilon project isnt adorned with the Universe-famous LCARS user interface, it does provide a comprehensive simulation scenario, in a multiplayer setting. Designed as a LAN or WAN multiplayer game hosted by the server that also serves as the main screen, four to six additional devices are required to handle the non-captain tasks. These include helm, weapons, engineering, science and relay, which includes comms.\nScenarios are created by the game master, not unlike a DD game, with the site providing a reference and various examples of how to go about this.\nThe free and open source games binaries can be obtained directly from the site, but its also available on Steam. The game isnt limited to just Trek either, but scenarios can be crafted to fit whatever franchise or creative impulse feels right for that LAN party.\nObviously building the whole thing into a realistic starship bridge is optional, but it certainly looks like more fun that way.", "title": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u300cEmptyEpsilon\u300d\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u8266\u6a4b\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u4f5c\u6210\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "EmptyEpsilon\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306eSF\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u7121\u6599\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cEmptyEpsilon\u300d", "LAN\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3092\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u4f53\u9a13"]}

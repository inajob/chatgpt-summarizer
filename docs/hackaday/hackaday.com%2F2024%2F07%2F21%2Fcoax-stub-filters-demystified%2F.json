They look for all the world like short circuits or open circuits, and yet work their magic and act to match feedline impedances or even as bandpass filters. Pretty interesting behavior from a little piece of coaxial cable.\nIf youve ever wondered how stub filters do their thing, [Fesz] has you covered. His latest video concentrates on practical filters made from quarter-wavelength and half-wavelength stubs. Starting with LTspice simulations, he walks through the different behaviors of open-circuit and short-circuit stubs, as well as what happens when multiple stubs are added to the same feedline. He also covers a nifty online calculator that makes it easy to come up with stub lengths based on things like the velocity factor and characteristic impedance of the coax.\nIts never just about simulations with [Fesz], though, so he presents a real-world stub filter for FM broadcast signals on the 2-meter amateur radio band. The final design required multiple stubs to get 30 dB of attenuation from 88 MHz to 108 MHz, and the filter seemed fairly sensitive to the physical position of the stubs relative to each other. Also, the filter needed a little LC matching circuit to move the passband frequency to the center of the 2-meter band. All the details are in the video below.\nIts pretty cool to see what can be accomplished with just a couple of offcuts of coax. Plus, getting some of the theory behind those funny little features on PCBs that handle microwave frequencies is a nice bonus. This microwave frequency doubler is a nice example of what stubs can do.\n\n", "title": "\u30b3\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3001LTspice\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u30b9\u30c8\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7279\u6027\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u3069\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u9577\u3055\u8a08\u7b97\u3082\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08", "LTspice\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b: \u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u7528", "FM\u653e\u9001\u4fe1\u53f7\u7528\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30b3\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5"]}

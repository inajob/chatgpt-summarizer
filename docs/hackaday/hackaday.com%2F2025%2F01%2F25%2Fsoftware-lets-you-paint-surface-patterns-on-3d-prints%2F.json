This time, the GPL v3 licensed program has gained early support for paint-on textures.\nFuzzyficator works as a plugin to OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and PrusaSlicer. The process starts with an image that acts as a displacement map. Displacement map pixel colors represent how much each point on the print surface will be moved from its original position. Load the displacement map into Fuzzyficator, and you can paint the pattern on the surface right in the slicer.\nThis is just a proof of concept though, as [TenTech] is quick to point out. There are still some bugs to be worked out. Since the modifications are made to the G-code file rather than the model, the software has a hard time figuring out if the pattern should be pressed into the print, or lifted above the base surface. Rounded surfaces can cause the pattern to deform to fit the surface.\nIf youd like to take the process into your own hands, weve previously shown how Blender can be used to add textures to your 3D prints.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9769\u547d\uff01Fuzzyficator\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "body": "Fuzzyficator\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u30d0\u30b0\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9769\u547d\uff01Fuzzyficator\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "Fuzzyficator\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u52b9\u679c", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8868\u9762\u306b\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5", "Blender\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u52a0\u5de5\u624b\u6cd5"]}

He got a number of lucky breaks, including getting root on the device just by soldering on a serial terminal, but was faced with having to reverse-engineer a binary that implemented RSA encryption and decryption.\nEspecially when they\u2019re done right, and written to avoid side-channel attacks, encryption routines aren\u2019t intuitive, even when you\u2019re looking at the C source. Reversing it from the binary would be a tremendous hurdle.\nThat\u2019s when [Alex] started plugging in strings he found in the binary into a search engine. And that\u2019s when he found exactly the open source project that the webcam used, which gave him the understanding he needed to crack the rest of the nut.\nNever forget! When you\u2019re doing some reverse engineering, whether hardware or software, do a search for every part number and every string you find in memory. If you\u2019re like me, it might feel like cheating a little bit, but it\u2019s just being efficient. It\u2019s what all your hacker heroes say they do, and if you\u2019re lucky, it might just be the break you need too."}

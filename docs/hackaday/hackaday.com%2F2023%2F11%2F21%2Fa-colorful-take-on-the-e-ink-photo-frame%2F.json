[Wolfgang Ziegler] used an e-ink screen to create a colorful digital picture frame.\nStarting with a seven color e-ink HAT hed forgotten he had, a spare Pi Zero, and analog photo frame, he pieced the parts together into a pretty slick, sunlight readable photo frame. [Ziegler] details how he set up the frame to display new images using the Pimoroni inky library. He set a fifteen minute refresh interval since the color e-ink display takes 30 seconds to refresh to keep it from looking weird too often.\nWith the holidays coming up, this might make a perfect gift for family that wants to see the latest from your travels without blasting it to the whole internet. Weve covered a few different options from a lightweight ESP8266 build, to this one that can rotate, and even issues with some of the commercial options."}

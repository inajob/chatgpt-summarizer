Its something of a footnote today but it seems Coleco did get something right as it had a great keyboard. [Nick Bild] has one, and hes brought it into the 21st century with a USB interface.\nThe interfacing is courtesy of a Teensy microcontroller board as in so many other keyboard projects, but what makes this extra-interesting is the way the Coleco keyboard speaks to the world. Instead of merely being a matrix peripheral as were so many of its contemporaries, Coleco created their own custom serial bus for Adam desktop peripherals called AdamNet, and thus the keyboard contains its own 6801 microcontroller to perform the interfacing. The Teensy then is a USB-to-AdamNet interface, and could were guessing be made to talk to other Coleco peripherals if they exist.\nYou can see the keyboard in action below the break, and as you can see it fits quite nicely into 2023.\u00a0 Weve not featured much about the Adam before here at Hackaday, but the ColecoVision console which sits at its heart has even seen a new version.\n\n", "title": "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fColeco Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306eUSB\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u5316", "body": "Coleco Adam\u306f8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u3072\u3068\u3064\u3067\u3001\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30d0\u30b0\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3001\u5165\u624b\u56f0\u96e3\u3067\u5931\u6557\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002[Nick Bild]\u3055\u3093\u306fUSB\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306721\u4e16\u7d00\u306b\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Teensy\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9\u3067\u901a\u4fe1\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fColeco Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306eUSB\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u5316", "Coleco Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304cTeensy\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u672a\u6765\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305fColeco Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "AdamNet\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4ed6\u306eColeco\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Coleco Adam\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c2023\u5e74\u306b\u3082\u5341\u5206\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50"]}

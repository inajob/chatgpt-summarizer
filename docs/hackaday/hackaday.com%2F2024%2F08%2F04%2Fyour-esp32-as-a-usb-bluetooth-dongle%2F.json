Behind that ubiquity is a protocol layer called HCI, or Host Controller Interface, a set of commands allowing a host computer to talk to a Bluetooth interface.\u00a0 That interface doesnt have to be special, and [Dakhnod] is here to show us that it can be done with an ESP32 microcontroller through its USB interface.\nThe linked repository doesnt tell us which of the ESP32 variants it works with, but since not all of them have a USB peripheral were guessing one of the newer variety. It works with Linux computers, and were told it should work with Windows too if a HCI driver is present. We might ask ourselves why such a project is necessary given the ubiquity of Bluetooth interfaces, but for us its provided the impetus to read up on how it all works.\nWe cant find anyone else in our archive whos made a Bluetooth dongle in this way, but weve certainly seen sniffing of HCI commands to reverse engineer a speakers communications.", "title": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fBluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u306eBluetooth\u5229\u7528\u304c\u30b7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ec\u30b9\u306b\u306a\u308b\u904e\u7a0b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\uff08HCI\uff09\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002ESP32\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fBluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u53d6\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fBluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\uff08HCI\uff09\u3068Bluetooth\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u6027", "Linux\u304a\u3088\u3073Windows\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bBluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u624b\u9806", "Bluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bESP32\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305fBluetooth\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

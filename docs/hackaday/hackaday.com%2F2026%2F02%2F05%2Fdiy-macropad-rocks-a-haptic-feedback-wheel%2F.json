However, you can go a lot further, too. [CNCDan] demonstrates this well with his sleek macropad build, which throws haptic feedback into the mix.\nThe build features six programmable macro buttons, which are situated either on side of a 12864 OLED display. This setup allows the OLED screen to show icons that explain the functionality of each button. Theres also a nice large rotary knob, surrounded by 20 addressable WS2811 LEDs for visual feedback. Underneath the knob lives an an encoder, as well as a brushless motor typically used in gimbal builds, which is driven by a TMC6300 motor driver board. Everything is laced up to a Waveshare RP2040 Plus devboard which runs the show. Its responsible for controlling the motors, reading the knob and switches, and speaking USB to the PC that its plugged into.\nIts a compact device that nonetheless should prove to be a good productivity booster on the bench. Weve featured [CNCDans] work before, too, such as this nifty DIY VR headset.\n\n", "title": "- \u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff1aUSB HID\u3068\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u30026\u3064\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3068OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u8996\u899a\u7684\u901a\u77e5\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff1aUSB HID\u3068\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u4ed8\u304d\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u8868\u793a", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3068\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30ce\u30d6\u3067\u4f5c\u696d\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u5411\u4e0a", "- \u6c4e\u7528\u6027\u306e\u9ad8\u3044RP2040 Plus\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

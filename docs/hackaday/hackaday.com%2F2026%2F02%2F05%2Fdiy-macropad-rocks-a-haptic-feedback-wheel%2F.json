However, you can go a lot further, too. [CNCDan] demonstrates this well with his sleek macropad build, which throws haptic feedback into the mix.\nThe build features six programmable macro buttons, which are situated either on side of a 12864 OLED display. This setup allows the OLED screen to show icons that explain the functionality of each button. Theres also a nice large rotary knob, surrounded by 20 addressable WS2811 LEDs for visual feedback. Underneath the knob lives an an encoder, as well as a brushless motor typically used in gimbal builds, which is driven by a TMC6300 motor driver board. Everything is laced up to a Waveshare RP2040 Plus devboard which runs the show. Its responsible for controlling the motors, reading the knob and switches, and speaking USB to the PC that its plugged into.\nIts a compact device that nonetheless should prove to be a good productivity booster on the bench. Weve featured [CNCDans] work before, too, such as this nifty DIY VR headset.\n\n"}

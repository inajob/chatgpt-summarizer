This online zine covers a wide array of technical topics, from software development to hardware hacking, computer security, and electronics. Its distributed as a PDF, and is notable for its somewhat experimental format that limits each article to a single page. The first two issues were released back in 2019, but between a global pandemic and some administrative shuffling, progress on the current release was slowed considerably.\nAmong the 50 articles that make up the third Paged Out! there are a number of pieces focusing on hardware, such as the serial communications cheat sheet from [Jay Greco], and a pair of articles covering the state-of-the-art in custom keyboards. But overall the zine does lean hard into programming topics, and is probably best suited for those with an interest in software development and infosec.\nStill, were sure you can find something in Paged Out! that should interest you. Heres hoping the time between releases can be reduced a bit for Issue #4.", "title": "Paged Out!

ARM is having a bit of a moment by improving the performance-per-watt of many computing platforms, but some other ideas need to come to the forefront to make any big pushes in this area. This startup called Flow Computing claims it can improve modern CPUs by a significant amount with a slight change to their standard architecture.\nIt hopes to make these improvements by adding a parallel processing unit, which they call the back end to a more-or-less standard CPU, the front end. These two computing units would be on the same chip, with a shared bus allowing them to communicate extremely quickly with the front end able to rapidly offload tasks to the back end that are more inclined for parallel processing. Since the front end maintains essentially the same components as a modern CPU, the startup hopes to maintain backwards compatibility with existing software while allowing developers to optimize for use of the new parallel computing unit when needed.\nWhile well take a step back and refrain from claiming this is the future of computing until we see some results and maybe a prototype or two, the idea does show some promise and is similar to some ARM computers which have multiple cores optimized for different tasks, or other computers which offload non-graphics tasks to a GPU which is more optimized for processing parallel tasks. Even the Raspberry Pi is starting to take advantage of external GPUs for tasks like these.", "title": "\"\u65b0\u3057\u3044CPU\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u3078\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\"", "body": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u9650\u754c\u306b\u9054\u3057\u3001CPU\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bARM\u3084Flow Computing\u306a\u3069\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3002\u7279\u306bFlow Computing\u306f\u4e26\u5217\u51e6\u7406\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eCPU\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3082\u5916\u90e8GPU\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u65b0\u3057\u3044CPU\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u3078\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\"", "\"\u30d1\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u51e6\u7406\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u3067CPU\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u5411\u4e0a\"", "\"ARM\u306b\u7d9a\u304f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3CPU\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6311\u6226\"", "\"\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3CPU\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u5c55\u671b\"", "\"\u65e2\u5b58\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u4fdd\u3061\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306eCPU\u9769\u65b0\""]}

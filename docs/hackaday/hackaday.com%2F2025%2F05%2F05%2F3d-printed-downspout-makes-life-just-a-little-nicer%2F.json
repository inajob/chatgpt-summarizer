Sometimes, its just to deal with something that kind of bugs you. This hack from [Dillan Stock] is in the latter category, replacing an ugly, redundant downspout with an elegant 3D printed pipe.\nAs [Dillan] so introspectively notes, this was not something that absolutely required a 3D print, but when all you have a hammer, everything is a nail, and 3D printing is [his] hammer. We can respect that, especially when he hammers out such a lovely print.\nBy modeling this section of his house in Fusion 360, he could produce an elegantly swooping loft to combine the outflow into one downspout. Of course the assembly was too big to print at once, but any plumber will tell you that ABS welds are waterproof. Paint and primer gets it to match the house and hopefully hold up to the punishing Australian sun.\nThe video, embedded below, is a good watch and a reminder than not every project has to be some grand accomplishment. Sometimes, it can be as simple as keeping you from getting annoyed when you step into your backyard.\nWeve seen rainwater collection hacks before; some of them a lot less orthodox. Of course when printing with ABS like this, one should always keep in mind the ever-escalating safety concerns with the material.\n\n"}

It worked, but removing the support left unsightly blemishes on the part. A commenter mentioned that the support doesnt have to exactly touch the part to support it. You can see the results of trying that method in the video below.\nIn this case [Cloug42] uses Fusion, but the idea would be the same regardless of how you design your parts. Originally, the support piece was built as a single piece along with the target object. However, he changed it to make the object separate from the support structure. Thats only the first step, though. If you import both pieces and print, the result will be the same.\nInstead, he split the part into the original two objects that touch but dont blend together. The result looks good.\nWe couldnt help but notice that we do this by mistake when we use alternate materials for support (for example, PETG mixed with PLA or PLA with COPE). Turns out, maybe you dont have to switch filament to get good results.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65cb\u76e4\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u652f\u3048\u65b9", "body": "Clough42\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u652f\u6301\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u4f59\u8a08\u306a\u50b7\u3092\u6b8b\u3055\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65cb\u76e4\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u652f\u3048\u65b9", "- \u652f\u6301\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3067\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\u304c\u683c\u6bb5\u306b\u5411\u4e0a", "- \u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5206\u5272\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u826f\u597d\u306a\u7d50\u679c", "- \u6750\u6599\u9078\u3073\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052", "- Fusion\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853"]}

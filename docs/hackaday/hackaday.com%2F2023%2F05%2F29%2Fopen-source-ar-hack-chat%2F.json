Thats too bad, really, because theres a lot going on in the rest of the spectrum that could potentially inform our ROYGBIV-centric view of the world. Think of the possibilities of being able to see UV the way an insect does, or being able to watch the radiation pattern of an antenna and make adjustments on the fly. Sounds like a job for augmented reality.\nIf seeing the world with different eyes sounds as cool to you as it does to us, you wont want to miss Raj Nakarajas stop by the Hack Chat. Raj is head of engineering at Brilliant Labs, an augmented reality company thats looking to bring AR into the mainstream. Theyve got some cool ideas about AR, and were going to take the opportunity to talk to Raj about open-source AR in general, Brilliants products specifically, and how AR can be incorporated into not only our projects, but into our lives as well.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, May 31 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.\nClick that speech bubble to the right, and you\u2019ll be taken directly to the Hack Chat group on Hackaday.io. You don\u2019t have to wait until Wednesday; join whenever you want and you can see what the community is talking about."}

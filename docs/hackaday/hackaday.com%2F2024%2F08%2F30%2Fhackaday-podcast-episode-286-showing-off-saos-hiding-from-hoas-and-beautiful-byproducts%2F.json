It was a bit of a chore, with a couple of computer crashes and some side-quests down a few weird rabbit holes, but we managed to get things together in the end.\nTune in and youll hear us bemoan HOAs and celebrate one hams endless battle to outwit them, no matter what the golf cart people say about his antennas. Are you ready to say goodbye to the magnetic stripe on your credit card? We sure are, but were not holding our breath yet. Would you 3D print a 55-gallon drum? Probably not, but you almost can with a unique Cartesian-polar hybrid printer. And, if you think running MS-DOS on a modern laptop is hard, guess again  or, maybe you just have to get really lucky.\nWe also took a look at a digital watch with a beautiful display, a hacked multimeter, modern wardriving tools, switchable magnets, and debate the eternal question of v-slot wheels versus linear bearings. And finally, you wont want to miss our look at whats new with 3D scanning, and the first installment of Kristinas new Boss Byproducts series, which delves into the beauty of Fordite.\n\ufeff\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the DRM-free MP3.\n\nEpisode 286 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nSupercon 2024: May The Best Badge Add-ons Win\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to bmgxyz for guessing a hand-crank generator.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nNice Retro Displays Set This Watch On Edge\n\nSupercon 2024: Show Off Your Unique Display Tech\nMotorola MicroTAC  Wikipedia\n\n\nFast 3D Printing With A Polar, Four Quadrant Custom Machine\n3D Printed Electronics Breadboard\n\nHackaday Prize 2023: Jumperless, The Jumperless Jumperboard\nThe Mind-Blowing Machines that Stamp Millions of Metal Parts  Smarter Every Day 288\n\n\nFarewell Magnetic Stripe\n\nBarcodes Enter The Matrix In 2027\nThe Barcode Revolution: Welcome To Our Automated World\n\n\nRunning Stock MS-DOS On A Modern ThinkPad\nHidden Gutter Antenna Keeps HOA Happy\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nUsing A 2D Scanner To Make 3D Things\nV-Slot Wheels Or Linear Rails?\nWardriving Tools In The Modern Era\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nBacklight Switch For A Better Multimeter\nIt Turns Out, A PCB Makes A Nice Watch Dial\nYou Can 3D Print Yourself Some Simple Magnetic Switches\n\nShop-Built Fixtures Reveal The Magic Of Switchable Permanent Magnets\n\n\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nWhat\u2019s New In 3D Scanning?

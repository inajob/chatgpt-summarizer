Somehow [Boaztheostrich] found it so daunting he procrastinated his way into a AR voxel-based CAD app he calls ABCCAD, written in Godot for the Meta Quest 3.\nThe app is simplicity itself: pressing A or X on the controller spawns a cube, which you can place wherever you like in virtual space by moving the controller in real space. The trigger then saves the cube position. Grabbing a cube uses the controllers grab buttons. You can even change colors (with B or Y), but like in OpenSCAD it appears thats not actually going to have any effect on the exported STL. Check it out in action in the demo video embedded below.\nAs far as CAD applications go, this is as simplistic as it gets, but theres a certain charm to its simplicity. Its almost like virtual legos. Besides, TinkerCAD wasnt much more complicated when it started out, and look at it now.\nSure, one could say if [Boaz] wanted to do CAD hed have been better off putting the time into learning good old OpenSCAD or FreeCAD (which can now get you SolidWorks certs, apparently), but this is a fun little app that let him stretch his chops in Godot, another great open-source tool. ABCCAD is, itself, open-source under an MIT license.\nThanks to [Boaztheostrich] for the tip.\nWe seem to have a paucity of posts under the Godot tag, so if youve got a hack that uses the open-source game engine, please send us a tip.\n\n", "title": "- AR\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aCAD\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u300cABCCAD\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Boaztheostrich\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305fAR CAD\u30a2\u30d7\u30eaABCCAD\u306f\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3055\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3067\u3001Meta Quest 3\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- AR\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aCAD\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u300cABCCAD\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Meta Quest 3\u5411\u3051\u306e\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u5728\u306a\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u7a7a\u9593\u4f5c\u6210", "- Godot\u3067\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eCAD\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3044\uff01\u76f4\u611f\u7684\u306a\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c", "- CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1aABCCAD\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

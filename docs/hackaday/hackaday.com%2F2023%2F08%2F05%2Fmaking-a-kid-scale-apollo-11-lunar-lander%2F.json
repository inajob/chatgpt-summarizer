Later, a little paint makes the frying pan become a pseudo-antenna mounted on the landers exterior.\nInside, the lander has a control panel with a lot of arcade-style buttons and LED lighting. Its pretty simple stuff, but livens things up a lot. Bright red lighting for the engine combined with a couple of slow strobe lights really makes it come alive in the dark. The gold foil? Emergency thermal blankets wrapped around the frame.\nWe happen to have the perfect chaser for this kid-scale lunar module: the Apollo 11 moon landing, recreated with animatronics and LEGO.\n\n"}

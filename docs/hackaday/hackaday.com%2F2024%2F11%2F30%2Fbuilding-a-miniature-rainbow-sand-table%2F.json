But it can also be beautiful \u00a0drag a small ball through it in a controlled manner you can make some really pretty patterns. Thats precisely what this compact build from [Printerforge] does.\nThe build relies on an ESP32 as the brains of the operation. It employs small 28BYJ-48 motors to run the motion platform. These were chosen as they operate on 5 V, simplifying the build by allowing everything to run off a single power supply. Along with a bunch of 3D printed parts, the motors are assembled into motion system with linear rods and belts in a CoreXY layout, chosen for speed and precision. Its charged with moving a small magnet to drag a ball bearing through the sand to draw patterns under the command of G-code generated with the Sandify tool.\nWeve seen some great sand table builds over the years. Some use polar coordinate systems, while others repurpose bits of 3D printers.

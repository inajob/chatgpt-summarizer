If you are able to operate a 25-meter dish, a transmitter, a solid software-defined radio, and an atomic clock, the answer is: yes, they can go all the way to Venus and back. On March 22, 2025, the Dwingeloo telescope in the Netherlands successfully pulled off an Earth-Venus-Earth (EVE) bounce, making them the second group of amateurs ever to do so. The full breakdown of this feat is available in their write-up here.\nBouncing signals off planets isnt new. NASA has been at it since the 1960s  but amateur radio astronomers have far fewer toys to play with. Before Dwingeloos success, AMSAT-DL achieved the only known amateur EVE bounce back in 2009. This time, the Dwingeloo team transmitted a 278-second tone at 1299.5 MHz, with the round trip to Venus taking about 280 seconds. Stockerts radio telescope in Germany also picked up the returning echo, stronger than Dwingeloos own, due to its more sensitive receiving setup.\nPost-processing wasnt easy either. Doppler shift corrections had to be applied, and the received signal was split into 1 Hz frequency bins. The resulting detections clocked in at 5.4 sigma for Dwingeloo alone, 8.5 sigma for Stockerts recording, and 9.2 sigma when combining both datasets. A clear signal, loud and proud, straight from Venus surface.\nThe experiment was cut short when Dwingeloos transmitter started failing after four successful bounces. More complex signal modulations will have to wait for the next Venus conjunction in October 2026.

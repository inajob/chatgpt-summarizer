Theyre less good for impressing the Internet. If you really want to show off, you gotta go really big  or really small. [juskim] went the latter route, and added RGB to boot!\nThis was [juskim]s attempt to produce the worlds smallest keyboard. We cant guarantee that, but its certainly very small. You could readily clasp it within a closed fist. It uses a cut down 60% key layout, but its still well-featured, including numbers, letters, function keys, and even +,-, and =. The build uses tiny tactile switches that are SMD mounted on a custom PCB. An ATmega32U4 is used as the microcontroller running the show, which speaks USB to act as a standard human interface device (HID). The keycaps and case are tiny 3D printed items, with six RGB LEDs installed inside for the proper gamer aesthetic. The total keyboard measures 66 mm x 21 mm.\nDont expect to type fast on this thing. [juskim] only managed 14 words per minute. If you want to be productive, consider a more traditional design.\n\n", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306eRGB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u65e5\u5e38\u306e\u5165\u529b\u7528\u9014\u3067\u306f\u30d5\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u308b\u306b\u306f\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u304b\u5927\u304d\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3002[juskim]\u306fRGB\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u306f1\u5206\u959314\u8a9e\u3060\u3051\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306eRGB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306bRGB\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "ATmega32U4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba66 mm x 21 mm\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

What if the jaws were completely within your\u00a0 control? Thats the idea behind [Upside Down Labs] muscle-controlled servo claw game.\nWhile electromyography (EMG) is great for identifying neuro-muscular abnormalities and allows for amazing prosthetic limbs to work, it can also be used for fun. As youll see in the video after the break, accurate block-stacking (and possible candy-grabbing) depends on teamwork and tensed muscles.\nThough the user provides the muscle, the brains behind this operation is an Arduino Uno with a Muscle BioAmp shield stacked on top, which [Upside Down Labs] also created. This shield makes it ridiculously easy to connect EMG sensors and other I\u00b2C devices like screens and, well, servo claws. From there, its really just a matter of printing the claw, connecting it to a 9g servo, and using an accompanying kit to prepare the skin and connect the muscles to the Arduino. Be sure to check it out in tense block-stacking action after the break.\nIf you want to listen in on your muscles, look no further than the BioAmp EMG Pill.\n\n"}

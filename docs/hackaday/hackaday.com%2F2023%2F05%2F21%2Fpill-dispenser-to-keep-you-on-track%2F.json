[M. Bindhammer] faces this scenario every day, so he built his own robotic pill dispenser.\nThe core of the project is a 3D printed dispensing drum with individual pockets for morning and evening medication. It is mounted directly to a 360\u00b0 winch servo, normally used for RC sailboats, while a second conventional servo opens a small sliding door to drop the pills onto the dispensing tray. The tray integrates a sensitive touch sensor which can detect when [M] picks up the pills, without being triggered by the pills themselves.\n[M. Bindhammer] also included a small but loud speaker, connected to a speech synthesis module for audio reminders. The main controller is a Arduino Due with a custom breakout shield that also integrates a DS3231 real time clock. All the electronics are enclosed in a 80s style humanoid robot-shaped body, with dispensing drum on its chest, and an OLED screen as its face.\nThe end result is a very polished build, which should make [M. Bindhammer]s life with bipolar disorder a little bit easier, and he hopes it might help others as well.\nFor more medication related gadgets, take a peek at another pill dispenser and a 3D printed dosing spoon to replace an essential but discontinued commercial version."}

[M. Bindhammer] faces this scenario every day, so he built his own robotic pill dispenser.\nThe core of the project is a 3D printed dispensing drum with individual pockets for morning and evening medication. It is mounted directly to a 360\u00b0 winch servo, normally used for RC sailboats, while a second conventional servo opens a small sliding door to drop the pills onto the dispensing tray. The tray integrates a sensitive touch sensor which can detect when [M] picks up the pills, without being triggered by the pills themselves.\n[M. Bindhammer] also included a small but loud speaker, connected to a speech synthesis module for audio reminders. The main controller is a Arduino Due with a custom breakout shield that also integrates a DS3231 real time clock. All the electronics are enclosed in a 80s style humanoid robot-shaped body, with dispensing drum on its chest, and an OLED screen as its face.\nThe end result is a very polished build, which should make [M. Bindhammer]s life with bipolar disorder a little bit easier, and he hopes it might help others as well.\nFor more medication related gadgets, take a peek at another pill dispenser and a 3D printed dosing spoon to replace an essential but discontinued commercial version.", "title": "\u85ac\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u308b\u306a\uff01 \u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u578b\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u6295\u85ac\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5371\u967a\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u85ac\u3092\u914d\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u3002Arduino Due\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u305f80\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u4eba\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u671d\u6669\u306e\u4ed5\u5206\u3051\u3089\u308c\u305f\u85ac\u3092\u52dd\u624b\u306b\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ea\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3082\u4ed8\u5c5e\u3057\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u85ac\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u308b\u306a\uff01 \u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u578b\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u6642\u9593\u901a\u308a\u306b\u85ac\u304c\u98f2\u3081\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u3067\u500b\u6027\u7684\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u578b\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u5f62", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u4f8b", "5.\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30d4\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc"]}

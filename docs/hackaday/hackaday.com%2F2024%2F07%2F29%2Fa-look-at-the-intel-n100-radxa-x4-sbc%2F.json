The Intel N100 is one of a range of Alder Lake-N SoCs which are based on a highly optimized version of the Skylake core, first released in 2015. These cores are also used as efficiency cores in Intels desktop CPUs. Being x86-based, this means that the Radxa X4 can run any Linux, Windows and other OS from either NVMe (PCIe 3.0 x4) or eMMC storage. After getting his hands on one of these SBCs, [Bret] couldnt wait to take a gander at what it can do.\nInstalling Windows 11 and Debian 12 on a 500 GB NVMe (2230) SSD installed on the X4 board worked pretty much as expected on an x86 system, with just some missing drivers for the onboard Intel 2.5 Gbit Ethernet and WiFi, depending on the OS, but these were easily obtained via the Intel site and installed. The board comes with an installed RTC battery and a full-featured AMI BIOS, as well as up to 16 GB of LPPDR5 RAM.\nUsing the system with the Radxa PoE+ HAT via the 2.5 Gbit Ethernet port also worked a treat once using a quality PoE switch, even with the N100s power level set to 15 Watt from the default 6. The RP2040 MCU on the mainboard is connected to the SoC using both USB 2.0 and UART, according to the board schematic. This means that from the N100 all of the Raspberry Pi-style pins can be accessed, making it in many ways a more functional SBC than the Raspberry Pi 5, with a similar power envelope and cost picture.\nAt $80 USD before shipping for the 8 GB (no eMMC) version that [Bret] looked at one might ask whether an N100-based MiniPC could be competitive, albeit that features like PoE+\u00a0 and integrated RPi-compatible header are definite selling points.", "title": "Radxa X4: N100 x86_64 SoC\u3068RP2040 MCU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044SBC\u306e\u767a\u58f2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "body": "Radxa\u304cX4\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306eSBC\u306fN100 x86_64 SoC\u3068RP2040 MCU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3001Intel N100\u306f2015\u5e74\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305fSkylake\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001NVMe\u307e\u305f\u306feMMC\u304b\u3089Linux\u3084Windows\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f80\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306aRaspberry Pi 5\u3088\u308a\u3082\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["Radxa X4: N100 x86_64 SoC\u3068RP2040 MCU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044SBC\u306e\u767a\u58f2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "Radxa X4: Intel N100\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fLinux\u3084Windows OS\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308bSBC", "Radxa X4: 500 GB NVMe SSD\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057Windows 11\u3068Debian 12\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u53ef\u80fd\u306aSBC", "Radxa X4: RP2040 MCU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057Raspberry Pi\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30d4\u30f3\u30d8\u30c3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308bSBC", "Radxa X4: \u7af6\u4e89\u529b\u306e\u3042\u308b\u4fa1\u683c\u3067MiniPC\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306aSBC"]}

If youre anything like us, you like to rock out most of the time and take the occasional break to do your reading. Either way, you really cant go wrong with this MIDI bookmark from [Misfit Maker].\nThis slick little bookmark may look 3D printed, but its all carefully-cut foam board in two thicknesses. Even the keys are made foam board  theyre just wrapped in carbon fiber so they look extra cool.\nUnderneath that carbon fiber is a layer of aluminium tape to make them capacitive. [Misfit Maker] recommends using copper tape instead because it allows for wires to be soldered directly to the keys.\nThe brains of this beauty is in the form of an ESP32 which is controlling an MPR-121 capacitive touch sensor. If youd like to make one of these for yourself, there are plenty of helpful GIFs embedded in the thorough write-up. Be sure to check out the brief demo after the break.\nIf you want to easily MIDI-fy something and use touch inputs, you cant really go wrong with the Raspberry Pi Pico, which does capacitive touch natively.

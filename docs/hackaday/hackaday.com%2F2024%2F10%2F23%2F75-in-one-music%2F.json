The type of toy that featured a console covered in electronic components with spring terminals, and on which a variety of projects could be built by wiring up circuits. [Matthew North Music] has a couple of these, and hes made a video investigating whether they can be used to make music.\nThe kits hes found are a Radio Shack one from were guessing the 1970s, and a Cambridge University Recording Studio kit that looks to be 1990s-vintage. The former is all discrete components and passive, while the latter sports that digital audio record/playback chip that was the thing to have in a novelty item three decades ago. With them both he can create a variety of oscillator and filter circuits, though for the video he settles for a fairly simple tone whose pitch is controlled by an light-dependent resistor, and a metronome as a drum beat.\nThe result is a little avant garde, but certainly shows promise. The beauty of these kits is they can now be had for a song, and as grown-ups we dont have to follow the rules set out in the book, so we can see theres a lot of fun to be had. We look forward to some brave soul using them in a life performance at a hacker camp.\n", "title": "\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u591a\u304f\u306eHackaday\u306e\u8aad\u8005\u306f\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u9803\u306b\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3078\u306e\u8208\u5473\u3092\u80b2\u3093\u3060\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002[Matthew North Music] \u306f\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u304b\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u305f\u30021970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eRadio Shack\u88fd\u30681990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eCambridge University\u88fd\u306e\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u56de\u8def\u3084\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3002\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c", "\u30b1\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5927\u5b66\u88fd\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u5b50\u3069\u3082\u5411\u3051\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u5668", "\u97f3\u697d\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u3078\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u76db\u3093"]}

They can typically run from a lithium-ion or li-po battery, so its probable that like us youve toyed with the idea of running one from a solar panel. Its something we have in common with [saveitforparts], whose experiments with a range of different solar panels form the subject of a recent video.\nHe has three different models: one based around a commercial solar charger, another using an off-the-shelf panel, and a final one using the panel from a solar garden light. As expected the garden light panel cant keep an ESP32 with a radio going all day, but the other two manage even in the relatively northern climes of Alaska.\nAs a final stunt he puts one of the nodes out on a rocky piece of the southern Alaskan coastline, for any passing hacker to find. Its fairly obviously in a remote place, but it seems passing cruise ships will be within its range. We just know someone will take up his challenge and find it.\n\n", "title": "- \u30e1\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "Meshtastic\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3067\u3001\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e1\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30a2\u30e9\u30b9\u30ab\u306e\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30e1\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u904b\u7528", "- \u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u306eESP32\u904b\u7528\u306e\u5b9f\u969b", "- \u30d2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e1\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6311\u6226\u72b6"]}

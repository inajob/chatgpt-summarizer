They can typically run from a lithium-ion or li-po battery, so its probable that like us youve toyed with the idea of running one from a solar panel. Its something we have in common with [saveitforparts], whose experiments with a range of different solar panels form the subject of a recent video.\nHe has three different models: one based around a commercial solar charger, another using an off-the-shelf panel, and a final one using the panel from a solar garden light. As expected the garden light panel cant keep an ESP32 with a radio going all day, but the other two manage even in the relatively northern climes of Alaska.\nAs a final stunt he puts one of the nodes out on a rocky piece of the southern Alaskan coastline, for any passing hacker to find. Its fairly obviously in a remote place, but it seems passing cruise ships will be within its range. We just know someone will take up his challenge and find it.\n\n"}

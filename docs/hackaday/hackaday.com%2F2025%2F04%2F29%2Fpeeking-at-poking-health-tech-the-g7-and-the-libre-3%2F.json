For many, CGMs are real-time feedback machines for the body, offering glucose trendlines that help people rethink how they eat. They allow diabetics to continue their daily life without stabbing their fingertips several times a day, in the most inconvenient places. This video by [Becky Stern] is all about comparing two of the most popular continuous glucose monitors (CGMs): the Abbott Libre 3 and the Dexcom G7.\nBoth the Libre 3 and the G7 come with spring-loaded applicators and stick to the upper arm. At first glance they seem similar, but the differences run deep. The Libre 3 is the minimalist of both: two plastic discs sandwiching the electronics. The G7, in contrast, features an over-molded shell that suggests a higher production cost, and perhaps, greater robustness. The G7 needs a button push to engage, which users describe as slightly clumsy compared to the Libres simpler poke-and-go design. The nuance: G7s ten-day lifespan means more waste than the fourteen-day Libre, yet the former allows for longer submersion in water, if thats your passion.\nWhile these devices are primarily intended for people with diabetes, theyve quietly been adopted by a growing tribe of biohackers and curious minds who are eager to explore their own metabolic quirks. In February, we featured a dissection of the Stelo CGM, cracking open its secrets layer by layer.\n\n", "title": "\u6301\u7d9a\u8840\u7cd6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aAbbott Libre 3\u3068Dexcom G7", "body": "\u9023\u7d9a\u8840\u7cd6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\uff08CGM\uff09\u306f\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u98df\u4e8b\u306e\u898b\u76f4\u3057\u3084\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002Liber 3\u3068G7\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u6301\u7d9a\u8840\u7cd6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aAbbott Libre 3\u3068Dexcom G7", "\u8840\u7cd6\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u628a\u63e1\u3059\u308bCGM\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306eCGM\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u3055\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6280\u8853", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306eCGM\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u4f53\u3092\u77e5\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "Libre 3\u3068G7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

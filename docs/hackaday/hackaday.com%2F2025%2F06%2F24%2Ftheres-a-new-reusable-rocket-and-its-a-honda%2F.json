We all know Honda as a car company but it seems they are in the rocket business too, and they successfully tested a reusable rocket. Its an experimental 900 kg model that flew to a height of 300 m before returning itself to the pad, but it serves as a valuable test platform for Hondas take on the technology.\nIts a research project as it stands, but its being developed with an eye towards future low-cost satellite launches rather than as a crew launch platform.As a news story though its of interest beyond its technology, because its too easy to miss news from the other side of the world when all eyes are looking at Texas. Its the latest in a long line of interesting research projects from the company, and we hope that this time they resist the temptation to kill their creation rather than bring it to market."}

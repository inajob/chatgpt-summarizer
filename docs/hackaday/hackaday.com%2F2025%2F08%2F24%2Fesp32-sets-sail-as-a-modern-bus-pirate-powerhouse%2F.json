The first version came out way back in 2008, and there have been several revisions since then. You can buy pre-built Bus Pirate devices, but theres also the option now to build our own. The ESP32 Bus Pirate project has everything you need to turn an ESP32 device into a protocol sniffing/decoding powerhouse\u2014all on a board you may have sitting around from another project.\nThere are a ton of solutions when it comes to talking to different buses \u2014I2C, UART, JTAG, you name it, theres a purpose-built device for it. Over a decade ago, Dangerous Prototypes released the Bus Pirate, offering a Swiss Army knife of a tool to interface with this ever-expanding list of communications standards. The ESP32 Bus Pirate project is open-source firmware for ESP32s that gives them the ability to be the multi-tool that lets us communicate with a long list of protocols.\nIt supports a wide variety of devices, from the straightforward ESP32 S3 Dev Kit available from a long list of suppliers to the more specialized M5 Cardputer equipped with its own keyboard. The original Bus Pirate required plugging the board into a PC to use it; with this being ESP32-based, thats no longer a limitation. So long as you can supply power to the ESP32, you can connect and control it via WiFi and a web browser. In addition to the Bus Pirate protocols, the project allows us to directly control the pins on the ESP32 board, should you want to do more with it besides interfacing with one of the supported protocols. Be sure to check out some of our other articles about Bus Pirate, as its been a fantastic tool for the hacker community over the years.", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fBus Pirate\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Bus Pirate\u306f\u3001ESP32\u3067\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u6271\u3048\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fBus Pirate\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aBus Pirate\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u89e3\u6790\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "- \u591a\u5f69\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u30d0\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308bBus Pirate\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- WiFi\u7d4c\u7531\u3067ESP32\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3001Bus Pirate\u306e\u9032\u5316"]}

Shacks worth tens of thousands of dollars are easy to come by, and well venture a guess that there are hams out there pushing six figures with their investment in equipment. But hands down, the most expensive amateur radio station ever has to be the one aboard the\u00a0 International Space Station.\nSo what do you need to talk to a $100 billion space station? As it turns out, about $60 worth of stuff will do, as [saveitforparts] shows us in the video below. The cross-band repeater on the ISS transmits in the 70-cm ham band, meaning all thats needed to listen in on the proceedings is a simple handy talkie transceiver like the $25-ish Baofeng shown. Tuning it to the 437.800-MHz downlink frequency with even a simple whip antenna should get you some reception when the ISS passes over.\nIn our experience, the stock Baofeng antenna isnt up to the job, so something better like the Nagoya shown in the video is needed. Better still is a three-element Yagi tuned down slightly with the help of a NanoVNA; coupled with data on when the ISS will be within line-of-sight, picking up the near-constant stream of retransmissions from the station as Earth-based hams work it should be a snap  even though [saveitforparts] only listened to the downlink frequency here, for just a bit more of an investment its also possible for licensed hams to uplink to the ISS on 145.900 MHz.\nFor those who want a slightly higher level of difficulty, [saveitforparts] also has some tips on automating tracking with an old motorized mount for CCTV cameras. Pitchfork notwithstanding, its not the best antenna tracker, but it has promise, and were eager to see how it pans out  sorry. But in general, the barrier to entry for getting into space communications is so low that you could easily make this a weekend project. Weve been discussing this and other projects on the new #ham-shack channel over on the Hackaday Discord. You should pop over there and check it out  wed be happy to see you there.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "\u300c\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u901a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3082\u306e\u300d", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u306f\u6295\u8cc7\u984d\u306b\u4e0a\u9650\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u4f55\u5341\u4e07\u30c9\u30eb\u3082\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u8a00\u3048\u3070\u3001\u53d7\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u306f Baofeng \u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3068 Nagoya \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c $60 \u3067\u4e8b\u8db3\u308a\u308b\u3002\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4fdd\u6709\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306a\u3089\u3001\u5bfe\u5411\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3067\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u306e\u53c2\u5165\u969c\u58c1\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u4f4e\u304f\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u9031\u672b\u306b\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u901a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3082\u306e\u300d", "\u300c\u5b87\u5b99\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u30d0\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u304c\u4f4e\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u7406\u7531\u300d", "\u300cBaofeng\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306f\u3001\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u300d", "\u300cCCTV\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u300d", "\u300cHackaday Discord\u3067\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3046\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d"]}

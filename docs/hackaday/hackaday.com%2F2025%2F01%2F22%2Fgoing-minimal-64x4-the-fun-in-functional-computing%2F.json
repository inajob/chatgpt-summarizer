It\u2019s not a modern powerhouse, but a thoughtfully crafted throwback to the essence of computing. With just 61 logic ICs, VGA output, PS/2 input, and SSD storage, this DIY wonder packs four times the processing power of a Commodore 64.\nWhat sets [Slu4]s efforts apart is his refusal to follow the beaten track of CPU development. He imposes strict complexity limits on his designs, sticking to an ultra-minimalist Von Neumann architecture. His journey began with the Minimal Ur-CPU, a logic-chip-based computer that could crunch numbers but little else. Next came the Minimal 64, featuring VGA graphics and Space Invaders-level performance. The latest Minimal 644 takes it further, adding incredible speed while keeping the design so simple it\u2019s almost ridiculous. It\u2019s computing stripped to its rawest form\u2014no fancy sound, no dazzling graphics, just raw resourcefulness.\nFor enthusiasts of retro-tech and DIY builds, this project is a treasure trove. From text editors to starfield simulations to Sokoban, [Slu4] proves you don\u2019t need complexity to make magic. \n"}

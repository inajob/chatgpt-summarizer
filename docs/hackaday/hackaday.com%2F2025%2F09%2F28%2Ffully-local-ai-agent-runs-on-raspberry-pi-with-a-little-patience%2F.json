Its an experiment in many ways, but also a great demonstration not only of what is possible with the kinds of open tools and hardware available to a modern hobbyist, but also a reminder of just how far some of these software tools have come in only a few short years.\nMax Headbox is not just a local large language model (LLM) running on Pi hardware; the model is able to make tool calls in a loop, chaining them together to complete tasks. This means the system can break down a spoken instruction (for example, find the weather report for today and email it to me) into a series of steps to complete, utilizing software tools as needed throughout the process until the task is finished.\n\nWatch Max in action in the video (also embedded just below). Max is a little slow, but not unusably so. As far as proofs of concept go, it demonstrates that a foundation for such systems is perfectly feasible on budget hardware running free, locally installed software. Check out the GitHub repository.\nThe name is, of course, a play on Max Headroom, the purportedly computer-generated TV personality of the 80s who was actually an actor in a mask, just like the person behind what was probably the most famous broadcast TV hack of all time (while wearing a Max Headroom mask).\nThanks to [JasonK] for the tip!\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01AI\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u300cMax Headbox\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "AI\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u300cMax Headbox\u300d\u306f\u3001\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5f93\u3044\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u306a\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30ebAI\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01AI\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u300cMax Headbox\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u8a66\u305b\u308b\uff01\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30ebAI\u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5fdc\u3048\u308b\uff01Max Headbox\u306e\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u51e6\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "- \u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u306eAI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u69cb\u7bc9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- 80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Max Headroom\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u6027"]}

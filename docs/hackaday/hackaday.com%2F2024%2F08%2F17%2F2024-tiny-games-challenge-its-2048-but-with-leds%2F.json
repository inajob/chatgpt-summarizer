You slide numbered tiles around on a grid, combining them until you have one tile with a value of 2048 (although its possible to go higher). Legend has it that 2048 was created by a bored teenager in the space of a weekend to see if he could program a game from scratch.\nIt only took a couple of weekends for [David] to get Tiny2048 up and running. In this version, each RGB value represents a number value, and input comes from a rudimentary gesture detector  tilt it this way and that to move the LEDs and combine the numbers. As you might imagine, it was a bit tricky to use colors to represent numbers, so each one had to be sufficiently unique.\n[David] says that the LED matrix is a string of WS2812 LEDs in a grid formation, controlled by an ESP32-S3-MINI-1. Although this may be overkill, [David] broke out a bunch of IO at the top of the board so it can be used in the future as a dev board. Be sure to check it out in blinkenlight action after the break!\n\n\n  \n\n", "title": "LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u904a\u3076: Tiny2048 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "body": "2048\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u4e0a\u3067\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u3055\u305b\u3001\u5408\u4f53\u3055\u305b\u30661\u3064\u306e2048\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\uff08\u3082\u3063\u3068\u9ad8\u3044\u4fa1\u5024\u306b\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\uff09\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3059\u30022048\u306f\u9000\u5c48\u306a10\u4ee3\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u304c\u3001\u9031\u672b\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3092\u8a66\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3068\u4f1d\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u904a\u3076: Tiny2048 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6570\u5b57\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3088\u3046", "\u8da3\u5473\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: ESP32-S3-MINI-1\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a", "\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u59cb\u307e\u308a: 2048 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8d77\u6e90", "\u8272\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u73fe"]}

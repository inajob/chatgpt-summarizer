You slide numbered tiles around on a grid, combining them until you have one tile with a value of 2048 (although its possible to go higher). Legend has it that 2048 was created by a bored teenager in the space of a weekend to see if he could program a game from scratch.\nIt only took a couple of weekends for [David] to get Tiny2048 up and running. In this version, each RGB value represents a number value, and input comes from a rudimentary gesture detector  tilt it this way and that to move the LEDs and combine the numbers. As you might imagine, it was a bit tricky to use colors to represent numbers, so each one had to be sufficiently unique.\n[David] says that the LED matrix is a string of WS2812 LEDs in a grid formation, controlled by an ESP32-S3-MINI-1. Although this may be overkill, [David] broke out a bunch of IO at the top of the board so it can be used in the future as a dev board. Be sure to check it out in blinkenlight action after the break!\n\n\n  \n\n"}

They\u2019re loads of fun to pick one at random and actually try to follow the advice, as intended, but some of them are just plain good advice for creatives.\nOne that keeps haunting me is \u201cHonor thy error as a hidden intention\u201d, which basically boils down to taking a \u201cmistake\u201d and seeing where it leads you if you had meant to do it. I was just now putting the finishing touches on this week\u2019s Hackaday Podcast, and noticed that we have been honoring a mistake for the past 350-something shows. Here\u2019s how it happened.\nWhen Mike and I recorded the first-ever podcast, I had no idea how to go about doing it. But I grew up in Nashville, and know my way around the inside of a music studio, and I\u2019ve also got more 1990s-era music equipment than I probably need. So rather than do the reasonable thing, like edit the recording on the computer, we recorded to an archaic Roland VS-880 \u201cDigital Studio\u201d which is basically the glorified descendant of those old four-track cassette Portastudios.\nIf you edit audio in hardware, you can\u2019t really see what you\u2019re doing \u2013 you have to listen to it. And so, when I failed to notice that Mike and I were saying \u201cOK, are you ready?\u201d and \u201cSure, let\u2019s go!\u201d, it got mixed in with the lead-in music before we started the show off for real. But somehow, we said it exactly in time with the music, and it actually sounded good. So we had a short laugh about it and kept it.\nAnd that\u2019s why, eight years later, we toss random snippets of conversations into the intro music to spice it up. It was a mistake that worked. Had we been editing on the computer, we would have noticed the extra audio and erased it with a swift click of the mouse, but because we had to go back and listen to it, we invented a new tradition. Honor thy error indeed.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

This is exactly what [Chris Borge] realized when using his 3D scanner and finding that the included rotation table left quite a bit to be desired  providing him the perfect excuse to build a new one.\nOne of the main features of a rotation stage is the, well, rotation. This was done in [Chris]\u2019s case with a NEMA 17 stepper motor, perfect for precise rotation of scanning. Hooking up the motor to a basic perf board with an Arduino Nano allows for on the fly adjustments to rotation speed. To really solidify the over-engineering, [Chris] applies his obligatory concrete mix to add some heft to the stage.\nWhile the previous features could be removed/downgraded without much loss, the adjustable grid built into the top adds significant functionality. The grid is based on [Chris]\u2019s past projects, which allows cross compatibility.\nWe love over-engineering here at Hackaday, especially when adding something new.

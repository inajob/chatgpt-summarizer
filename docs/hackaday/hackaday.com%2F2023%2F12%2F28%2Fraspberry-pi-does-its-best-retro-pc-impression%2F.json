You can even get enclosures that will dress the Linux single-board computer up like a miniature version of your favorite retro console. But what about the old school PC gamers who want to relive their glory days in a palm-sized package?\nWell, if youve got a 3D printer, [fantasticmrdavid] might have just the solution for you. This second iteration of his printable Raspberry Pi enclosure is designed to look like the 286 desktop that he had in his youth, complete with a functional floppy drive in the front that takes an SD card. With a 3.5 inch MPI3508 LCD up in the monitor and a copy of DOSBox on the SD card, youre well on your way to booting up a copy of Windows 3.11 or building some contraptions in The Incredible Machine.\nWhile the external aesthetics of the design are impeccable, we appreciate that [fantasticmrdavid] didnt skimp on the internals. Theres mount points for dual 25 mm fans to keep the more powerful variants of the Raspberry Pi cool, and a speaker expansion board that plugs into the GPIO header to provide era-appropriate bloops and bleeps. The tiny details here really shine, like the fact that the face plates for the dual drives are designed as separate pieces so they can be printed in a different color than the main case.\nIf youre not interested in the classics, dont worry. Weve seen the Raspberry Pi stand in foraa modern gaming PC, complete with the RGB LEDs youd expect in a contemporary rig."}

This is a piece of hardware which manages virtual memory, seamlessly giving each process its own memory sandbox in which it shouldnt be able to rain on its neighbours parade. If theres no MMU all is not lost though, and [Uros Popovic] gives us a complete guide to building the MMU-less \u03bcClinux on a RISC-V microcontroller.\nThe result is something of a Linux-from-scratch for this platform and kernel flavour, but its so much more than that aside from its step-by-step explanation. Its probable that most of us have heard something of \u03bcClinux but have little direct knowledge of it, and he leads us through its workings as well as its limitations. As examples, standard ELF binaries arent suitable for these systems, and programmers need to use memory-safe techniques.\nWhether or not any of you will run with this guide and build a tiny MMU-less Linux system, anything which expands our knowledge on the subject has to be a good thing. its not the first time weve seen a RISC-V microcontroller turned to this task, with a nifty trick to get round the limitations of a particular architecture."}

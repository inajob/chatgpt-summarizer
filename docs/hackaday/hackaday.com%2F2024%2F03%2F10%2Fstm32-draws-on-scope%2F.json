However, if youve ever wanted to give it a go, youd be hard-pressed to find more information than the nearly hour-and-a-half video about the topic from [Low Byte Productions]. You can check out the video below.\nIf you prefer to jump straight into the code, theres a GitHub page. While the code is specific to the STM32, you can apply the ideas to anything.\n\nThe theory, of course, is simple. Generate voltages for the scopes X and Y inputs. How hard can it be? The devil, of course, is in the details. You need a reliable way to generate voltages in sync with each other, and depending on how you do that, you may need additional filtering to get good results.\nThe filtering is particularly important in this case because [Low Byte Productions] uses PWM outputs. While these are very simple to create, they do tend to have high-frequency noise on their outputs.\nOnce you have the idea, there are plenty of things you can do with a scope output. These projects work great with old analog scopes, and we see clocks made like this fairly often. We also see a number of video games. Heck, even a badge.\n"}

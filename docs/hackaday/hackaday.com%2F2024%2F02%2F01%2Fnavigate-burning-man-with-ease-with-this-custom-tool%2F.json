Even still, getting around at ground level can be a challenge at times, and its easy to get lost. To help get around easier, [Zach] developed a nifty GPS device built specifically for navigating the ephemeral clock-like city.\nThe device is built for a few simple purposes. It shows where you are, it helps you navigate somewhere youve been before, and it helps you navigate to portable toilets. Its set up to be usable both on bike and on foot, the typical ways of getting around the playa. Since Black Rock City is fairly simple, it uses an arrow to point to a desired waypoint, and is capable of storing up to five points of interest. Its built using a cheap GNSS receiver and transflective LCD screen, and a Pi Pico is the brains of the operation.\nThe value of the device is obvious, particularly when exploring deeper areas of the playa, or after the road signs have been removed or structures have been taken down or burnt to ashes. Weve seen some other great projects from the desert festival before, too. If youve got your own playa-spec hacks, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

There are the purely technical hacks, beautiful hacks, minimalist hacks, maximalist hacks, and then the straight-up oddball hacks. Sometimes what strikes us is the beauty of the execution. Sometimes it\u2019s clever choice of parts that were designed to do exactly the right thing, and simply watching them do their job well is satisfying, and other times we like to see parts fooled into doing something they have no right to.\nWhile I really like the above speaker build because it\u2019s beautiful, and because it uses a clever choice of audio amplifier to work with the supercapacitors\u2019 wild voltage swings, what really struck me about the project is that [Jamie Matthews] has been using it every day for the last nine months. It\u2019s on his desk and he uses it to listen to music.\nThat\u2019s a simple feat in a way, but it\u2019s a powerful one. Some of my absolutely favorite projects of my own are similar \u2013 they are ones that I use all the time. Not the cliche \u201clife hack\u201d, which are usually like a clever way to peel a grapefruit, but rather hacks that become part of daily life. So look around you, and if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll find a number of these \u201cdaily driver\u201d hacks. And if you do, celebrate them.\n(And maybe even send \u2019em in to the tips line to share!)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

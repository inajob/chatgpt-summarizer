In addition to this, you can even create a local phone exchange using just analog phones without connecting to a network as [Playful Technology] demonstrates in a recent video.\nThe ATA used in the video is the Grandstream HT802, which features one 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port and two RJ11 FXS ports for two POTS phones, allowing for two phones to be directly connected and configured using their own profiles.\nBy using a multi-FXS port ATA in this manner, you essentially can set up your own mini telephone exchange, with a long run of Cat-3 possible between an individual phone and the ATA. Use of the Ethernet port is necessary just once to configure the ATA, as demonstrated in the video. The IP address of the ATA is amusingly obtained by dialing *** on a connected phone and picking 02 as menu option after which a synthetic voice reads out the number. This IP address gets you into the administration interface.\n\nTo configure the ATA as an exchange, the local loopback address is used, along with a dial alias configured in the Dial Plan section. This way dialing e.g. 102 gets internally converted to dial the other FXS port. By setting up a similar plan on the other FXS port both phones can call each other, but its also possible to auto-dial when you lift the handset off the hook.\nThe rather hacky configuration ought to make clear that the ATA was not designed to be used in this manner, but if your use case involves this kind of scenario, its probably one of the cheaper ways to set up a basic, small phone exchange. There are even ATA models that have more than two ports, opening up more possibilities. Just keep in mind that not every ATA may support this kind of tweaking.\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u3092VoIP\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308bATA\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u3092VoIP\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308bATA\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30df\u30cb\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Grandstream HT802\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u3067\u96fb\u8a71\u540c\u58eb\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eATA\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9"]}

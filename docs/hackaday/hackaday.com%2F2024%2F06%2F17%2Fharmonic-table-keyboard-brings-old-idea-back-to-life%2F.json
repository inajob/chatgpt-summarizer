At the time it was a new musical instrument that was based on the harmonic table, but it launched during the Great Recession and due to its nontraditional nature and poor timing, the company went out of business. But the harmonic table layout has a number advantages for musicians over other keyboard layouts, so [Ben] has brought his own version of the unique instrument to life in his latest project.\nCalled the Midihex, the keyboard has a number of improvements over the version from C-Thru Music, most obviously its much larger 98 playable keys and five function keys. The keys themselves are similar to Cherry MX keys but which use Hall-effect sensors. This style of key allows the device to send continuous key position information to the host computer, and since this is a MIDI instrument, this capability allows it to support a MIDI protocol called MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) which allows each note to be more finely controlled by the musician than a standard MIDI instrument. The PCB is powered by a Teensy 4.1 at the core.\nFor any musicians that havent tried out a harmonic table before, an instrument like this might be worth trying out. The layout provides easier chord and scale patterns, and for beginner musicians it can have a much shallower learning curve than other types of instruments. If you cant find an original Axis-49 or Axis-64 anywhere to try out, though, we actually posted a teardown of one way back in 2009 when the company was still producing instruments.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305fMidiHex\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u767a\u8868\u3092\u898b\u9003\u3057\u305fC-Thru Music\u306eAxis-49\u3068Axis-64\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e0d\u9069\u5207\u306a\u6642\u671f\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u4f1a\u793e\u304c\u5012\u7523\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3088\u308a\u3082\u591a\u304f\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305fMidiHex\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "C-Thru Music\u88fd\u306eAxis-49\u3068Axis-64\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3092\u9003\u3057\u305f\u5834\u5408", "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aMidiHex\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6539\u826f\u70b9", "Teensy 4.1\u3092\u30b3\u30a2\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fMidiHex\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3068MidiHex\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7528\u9014"]}

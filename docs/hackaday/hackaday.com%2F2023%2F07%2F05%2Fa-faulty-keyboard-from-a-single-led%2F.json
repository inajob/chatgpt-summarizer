Then it started having odd intermittent problems with some keys appearing stuck, which led to a teardown and some fault finding. The culprit was a white LED  but why this was the case is a fascinating story.\nStripping it down there didnt seem to be an obvious culprit, but eventually, the trail led to a lack of diodes in the matrix. This keyboard had an extremely clever yet rather cursed design in which it used LEDs as both illumination and as a diode in the keyboard matrix circuit, and the faulty LED had a reverse breakdown condition that could be triggered under certain operational conditions.\nMore unexpectedly, it would sometimes hold on to its reverse breakdown state even after power off. Just when you think you understand a components properties, theres always room for surprise. And we can safely say weve learned something about the design of cheaper keyboards in reading the account. Its clear that when it comes to boards, its best to take no chances."}

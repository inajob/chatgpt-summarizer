With the increasing popularity of force-feedback pedals [Tristan Fenwick] built built an\u00a0active pedal\u00a0that can provide significant resistance.\n[Tristan] integrated a load cell into the 3D printed pedal linkage, which is connected to a 130 W NEMA23 servo motor via a 8 mm lead screw. With constant feedback from the load cell, a simple PID controller running on an Arduino to actively adjust the pedals position and the amount of resistance it provides.\nAt ~$250 in parts, its a significantly more affordable than the $2300 price tag on a single Simucube pedal, which served as inspiration for this project. There are still some issues to address, such as shaky ADC readings and a lack of computing power on the Arduino, the demo video after the break looks incredibly promising. [Tristan] also notes that 300 kg is overkill and a slightly smaller servo motor would probably also work.\nFor more incredible simulator inspiration, check out the\u00a0A-10 Warthog cockpit, a\u00a03D printed flight sim yoke and pedals, and a\u00a0tank driving simulator\u00a0from before the age of computer graphics.\n\n"}

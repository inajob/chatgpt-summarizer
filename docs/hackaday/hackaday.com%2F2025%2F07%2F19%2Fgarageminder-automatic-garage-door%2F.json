So they set about building their own, called GarageMinder. On the project page you will find a bill of materials, schematics, and some notes about the approach taken in various versions of the software. [Solo Pilot] also made the software available.\nThe basic hardware centers around a Raspberry Pi Zero W, but there are plans to switch to an ESP32. From the car side of things there are built-in continuous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement broadcasts, which the Raspberry Pi can detect. Building a reliable system on top of these unreliable signals is difficult and you can read about some of the challenges and approaches that were taken during development. This is a work in progress and additional techniques and approaches are going to be trialed in future.\nIf youre interested in Bluetooth garage door openers be sure to read about using a Bluetooth headset as a garage door opener for your Android device.", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30fc\u300cGarageMinder\u300d\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u65b0\u8eca\u306b\u81ea\u52d5\u958b\u9589\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001GarageMinder\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3002Raspberry Pi Zero W\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30fc\u300cGarageMinder\u300d\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fBluetooth\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- Bluetooth Low Energy\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2", "- ESP32\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u8a08\u753b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7", "- Android\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u306eBluetooth\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u6d3b\u7528\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

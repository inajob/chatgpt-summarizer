Consider the tinyCore  a small and nifty hexagon-shaped ESP32 board by [MR. INDUSTRIES], simplified for learning yet featureful enough to offer plenty of growth, and fully open.\nThe tinyCore boards hexagonal shape makes it more flexible for building wearables than the vaguely rectangular boards were used to, and its got a good few onboard gadgets. Apart from already expected WiFi, BLE, and GPIOs, you get battery management, a 6DoF IMU (LSM6DSOX) in the center of the board, a micro SD card slot for all your data needs, and two QWIIC connectors. As such, you could easily turn it into, say, a smartwatch, a motion-sensitive tracker, or a controller for a small robot  theres even a few sample projects for you to try.\nYou can buy one, or assemble a few yourself thanks to the open-source-ness  and, to us, the biggest factor is the [MR.INDUSTRIES] community, with documentation, examples, and people learning with this board and sharing what they make. Want a device with a big display that similarly wields a library of examples and a community? Perhaps check out the Cheap Yellow Display hacks!\n\n\nWe thank [Keith Olson] for sharing this with us!", "title": "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b66\u3079\u308b\uff01tinyCore\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "tinyCore\u306f\u6559\u80b2\u7528ESP32\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3001\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u3068\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b66\u3079\u308b\uff01tinyCore\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u4f5c\u308a\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u3001hexagon\u578bESP32\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "tinyCore\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3084\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01MR.

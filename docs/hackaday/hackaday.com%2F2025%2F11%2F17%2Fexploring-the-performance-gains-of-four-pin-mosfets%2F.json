These 4-pin packages are known as TO-247-4. The fourth pin provides an additional source for gate current return which can in turn lessen the effect of parasitic inductance on the gate-source when switching current, particularly at high speed.\nIn the video [DENKI OTAKU] uses his custom made testing board to investigate the performance characteristics of some 4-pin TO-247-4 MOSFETs versus their 3-pin TO-247 equivalents. Spoiler alert: the TO-247-4 MOSFETs have better performance characteristics. The video takes a close look at the results on the oscilloscope. The downside is that as the switching speed increases the ringing in the Vds waveform increases, too. If youre switching to a 4-pin MOSFET from a 3-pin MOSFET in your design you will need to be aware of this Vds overshoot and make accommodations for it.\nIf youd like to go deeper with MOSFET technology check out Introduction To MOSFET Switching Losses and MOSFETs \u2014 The Hidden Gate.\n\n", "title": "- 4\u30d4\u30f3MOSFET\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u30b1\u30eb\u30d3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "body": "4-pin MOSFET\uff08TO-247-4\uff09\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3084\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u89e3\u8aac\u30023-pin\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u901f\u5ea6\u5897\u52a0\u3067Vds\u632f\u52d5\u304c\u5927\u3002", "titles": ["- 4\u30d4\u30f3MOSFET\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u30b1\u30eb\u30d3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- TO-247-4 MOSFET\u3068TO-247\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u6642\u306eVds\u6ce2\u5f62\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u73fe\u8c61\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306eMOSFET\u9078\u5b9a\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "- MOSFET\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6df1\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9"]}

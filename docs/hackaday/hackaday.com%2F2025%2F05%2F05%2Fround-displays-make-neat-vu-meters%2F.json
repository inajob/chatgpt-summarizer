However, if you want a more flexible and modern solution, you could use round displays to simulate the same thing, as [mircemk] demonstrates.\nAt the heart of the build is an ESP32 microcontroller, chosen for its fast clock rate and overall performance. This is key when drawing graphics to a display, as it allows for fast updates and smooth movement  something that can be difficult to achieve on lesser silicon. [mircemk] has the ESP32 reading an audio input and driving a pair of GC9A01 round displays, which are the perfect form factor for aping the looks of a classic round VU meter. The project write-up goes into detail on the code required to simulate the behavior of a real meter, from drawing the graphics to emulating realistic needle movements, including variable sweep rates and damping.\nThe cool thing about using a screen like this is the flexibility. You can change the dials to a different look  or to an entirely different kind of readout  at will. Weve seen some of [mircemk]s projects before, too, like this capable seismometer. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306aVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5186\u5f62\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067VU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6a21\u5023\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u8868\u793a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306aVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u4e38\u578b\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u63cf\u753b\u3068\u91dd\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30d5\u30ec\u30ad\u30b7\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u8868\u793a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u5165\u529b\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226"]}

However, if you want a more flexible and modern solution, you could use round displays to simulate the same thing, as [mircemk] demonstrates.\nAt the heart of the build is an ESP32 microcontroller, chosen for its fast clock rate and overall performance. This is key when drawing graphics to a display, as it allows for fast updates and smooth movement  something that can be difficult to achieve on lesser silicon. [mircemk] has the ESP32 reading an audio input and driving a pair of GC9A01 round displays, which are the perfect form factor for aping the looks of a classic round VU meter. The project write-up goes into detail on the code required to simulate the behavior of a real meter, from drawing the graphics to emulating realistic needle movements, including variable sweep rates and damping.\nThe cool thing about using a screen like this is the flexibility. You can change the dials to a different look  or to an entirely different kind of readout  at will. Weve seen some of [mircemk]s projects before, too, like this capable seismometer. Video after the break.\n\n"}

He decided to see how hard it would be to design his own elevator based on Raspberry Pis. He started out with a panel for the elevator and a call panel for the elevator lobby. Of course, he would really need three call panels since he is pretending to have a three-floor building.\nIt all looks very professional, and he has lots of bells and whistles, including an actual alarm. With the control system perfected, it was time to think about the hydraulics and mechanical parts to make a door and an actual lift.\n\nIt is still just a model, but he does have 10A AC switches for the pumps. Everything talks via MQTT over WiFi. Theres also a web-based control dashboard. We didnt count how many Pi boards are in the whole system, but it is definitely more than three.\nIf you are wondering why this was built, we are too. But then again, we never really need an excuse to go off on some project, so we cant throw stones.\nWant to see a more practical build? Check it out. Perhaps hell start on an escalator next.\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "BorisDigital\u306fRaspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e2d\u3002\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3084\u547c\u3073\u51fa\u3057\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u542b\u3080\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u547c\u3073\u51fa\u3057\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "MQTT\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u6c34\u5727\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "\u6b21\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u30a8\u30b9\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

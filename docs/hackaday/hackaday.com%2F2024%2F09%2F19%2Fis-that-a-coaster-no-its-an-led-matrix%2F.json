While these might look like coasters at a distance, do not be deceived! Theyre actually [bitluni]s latest project!\n[bitluni]s high-fidelity LED matrix started life as some 88 LED matrices lying on the shelf for 10 years taunting him  admit it, were all guilty of this  before he finally decided to make something with them. That idea took the form of a tileable display with the help of some magnets and pogo pins, which is certainly a very satisfying way to connect these oddly futuristic blinky coasters together.\nIt all starts with some schematics and a PCB. Because the CH32V208 has an annoying package to solder, [bitluni] opted to have the PCB fab do placement for him. Unfortunately, though, and like any good prototype, it needed a bodge! [bitluni] had accidentally mirrored a chip in the schematic, meaning he had to solder one of the SMD chips on upside-down, dead bug mode. Fortunately, the rest was seemingly more successful, because with a little 3D-printed case and some fancy programming, the tiny tiles came to life in all of their rainbow-barfing glory. Sure, the pogo pins were less reliable than desired, but [bitluni] has some ideas for a future version were very much looking forward to.\nVideo after the break.\n\n\nHas your hunger for blinkenlights not been satiated? More posts about [bitluni] perhaps? How about the time [bitluni] made a very blinkenlight-y supercomputer?"}

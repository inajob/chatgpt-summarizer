While you have at least a rough idea of where you want to end up, there are so many ways to get there that you can get locked into analysis paralysis and never get the project off the ground. Or arguably worse, you just throw whatever dev board you have in the junk bin and deal with the consequences.\nWhile its hard to go wrong with relying on a familiar MCU and toolchain, [lcamtuf] argues in this recent guide to choosing microcontrollers that its actually not too much of a chore to make the right choice. Breaking the microcontroller universe down into three broad categories makes the job a little easier: simple process control, computationally intensive tasks, and IoT products. Figuring out where your project falls on that spectrum narrows your choices considerably.\nFor example, if you just need to read some sensors and run a few servos or solenoids, using something like a Raspberry Pi is probably overkill. On the other hand, a Pi or other SBC might be fine for something that you need wireless connectivity. We also appreciate that [lcamtuf] acknowledges that intangible considerations sometimes factor in, such as favoring a new-to-you MCU because youll get experience with technology you havent used before. It might not override technical considerations by itself, but you cant ignore the need to stretch your wings once in a while.\nTheres nothing earth-shattering here, but we enjoy think pieces like this. Its a bit like [lcamtuf]s recent piece on rethinking your jellybean op-amps.", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u59cb\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u7528\u9014\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066\u9078\u3076\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5927\u5207\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u9078\u629e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\uff1a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aMCU\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u304b\u3089IoT\u307e\u3067\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u5225\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u9078\u3073", "\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\u304b\uff1f", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044MCU\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u7a4d\u3080\u610f\u7fa9\u3068\u9078\u629e\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

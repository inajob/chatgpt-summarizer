That may down to childhood memories of when we got our first trainsets, or an excellent postwar marketing campaign by Lionel. Either way, now that Mariah Carey is blaring, were thinking about our holiday track layouts. Which makes this long presentation on Wiring for Small Layouts by [Chicago Crossing Model Railroad] quite timely.\nThere are actually three videos in this little course; the first focuses mostly on the tools and hardware used for DCC wiring (thats Digital Command Control), which will be of less interest to our readers most of you are well aware how to perform a linemans splice, crimp connectors onto a wire, and use terminal blocks.\nThe second two videos are actually about wiring, in the sense of routing all the wires needed for a modern layout which is a lot more than plug the rheostat into the tracks in one spot that our first Lionel boxed set needed. No, for the different accessories there are multiple busses at 5V, 12V and 24V along with DCC that need to be considered. Unsurprisingly enough given those voltages, he starts with an ATX power supply and breaks out from there.\nEven if youre not into model railroading, you might learn something from these videos if you havent done many projects with multiple busses and wire runs before. Its far, far too easy to end up with a rats nest of wires, be they DCC, I2C or otherwise. A little planning can save some big headaches down the line, and if this is a new skill for you [Chicago Crossing Model Railroad] provides a good starting point for that planning. Just skip ahead a couple minutes for him to actually start talking if you dont want the musical cliff notes montage at the start of the videos.\nIf you dont have any model trains, dont worry, you can 3D print them.\u00a0 Lack of room isnt really an excuse.\n\n"}

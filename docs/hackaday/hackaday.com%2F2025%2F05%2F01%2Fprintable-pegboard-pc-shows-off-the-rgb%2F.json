The fine folks at Corsair apparently agree, because theyve released files for an open-frame pegboard PC case on Printables.\nAccording to the writeup on their blog, these prints have held up just fine with ordinary PLA apparently theres enough airflow around the parts that heat sagging isnt the issue we would have suspected. ATX and ITX motherboards are both supported, along with a few power supply form factors. If your printer is smaller, the ATX mount is per-sectioned for your convenience. Their GPU brackets can accommodate beefy dual- and triple-slot models. Its all there, if you want to unbox and show off your PC build like the work of engineering art it truly is.\nOf course, these files werent released from the kindness of Corsairs corporate heart theyre meant to be used with fancy pegboard desks the company also sells. Still to their credit, they did release the files under a CC4.0-Attribution-ShareAlike license. That means theres nothing stopping an enterprising hacker from remixing this design for the ubiquitous SK\u00c5DIS or any other perfboard should they so desire.\nWeve covered artful open-cases before here on Hackaday, but if you prefer to hide the expensive bits from dust and cats, this midcentury box might be more your style. If youd rather no one know you own a computer at all, you can always do the exact opposite of this build, and hide everything inside the desk."}

Take for example a non-verbal person who cant necessarily control a touch screen in order to tell someone else what they need or want or think.\nThis is where Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices come in. Recently tasked with building such a device, [Thornhill!] came up with a great design that houses 160 different phrases in a fairly small package and runs on CircuitPython.\nBasically, the client presses the appropriate snap-dome button button and the corresponding phrase is spoken through the speaker. The 1016 grid of buttons is covered with a membrane that both feels nice and gives a bit of protection from spills.\nThe buttons can achieve high actuation forces and have a crisp tactile response, which means theyre probably gonna go a long way to keep the user from getting frustrated.\nThis handy AAC board is built on the Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather and two keypad matrices. If this werent useful enough as it is, [Thornhill!] also built an even smaller version with 16 buttons for the client to wear around their neck.\nDid you know? AAC boards arent just for humans."}

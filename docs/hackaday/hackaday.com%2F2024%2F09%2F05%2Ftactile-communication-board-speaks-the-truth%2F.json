Take for example a non-verbal person who cant necessarily control a touch screen in order to tell someone else what they need or want or think.\nThis is where Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices come in. Recently tasked with building such a device, [Thornhill!] came up with a great design that houses 160 different phrases in a fairly small package and runs on CircuitPython.\nBasically, the client presses the appropriate snap-dome button button and the corresponding phrase is spoken through the speaker. The 1016 grid of buttons is covered with a membrane that both feels nice and gives a bit of protection from spills.\nThe buttons can achieve high actuation forces and have a crisp tactile response, which means theyre probably gonna go a long way to keep the user from getting frustrated.\nThis handy AAC board is built on the Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather and two keypad matrices. If this werent useful enough as it is, [Thornhill!] also built an even smaller version with 16 buttons for the client to wear around their neck.\nDid you know? AAC boards arent just for humans.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30f4\u30fb\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08AAC\uff09\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u975e\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3084\u8003\u3048\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001AAC\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u306f160\u306e\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3001CircuitPython\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3068\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u8a71\u3055\u308c\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u3068\u9632\u6c34\u6027\u3082\u5099\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30c6\u30a3\u30f4\u30fb\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08AAC\uff09\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "CircuitPython\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f160\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u6240\u8981\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3068\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u8a71\u3059\u4fbf\u5229\u306aAAC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fAAC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u9867\u5ba2\u304c\u9996\u306b\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b16\u500b\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306aAAC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

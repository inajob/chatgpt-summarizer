NetBSD includes pygame in its repositories, though, and thats enough for a 2D puzzle game hes working on called Slantics. Its on GitHub, if youre curious.\nSlantics: possibly the only game written on PPC Macintosh hardware this year.\nWhy NetBSD? Well, [Chris] wants to use his vintage hardware so that, in his words collecting does not become hoarding and as the slogan goes: Of course it runs NetBSD! Its hard to remember sometimes that its been two decades since the last PPC Macintosh. After that long, PPC support in Linux is fading, as you might expect.\n[Chris] tried the community-supported PPC32 port of Debian Sid, but the installer didnt work reliably, and driver issues made running it Death by a thousand cuts. NetBSD, with its institutional obsession with running on anything and everything, works perfectly on this legally-adult hardware. Even better, [Chris] reports NetBSD running considerably faster, getting 60 FPS in pygame vs 25 FPS under Linux.\nThis is almost certainly not the year of the BSD Desktop, but if youve got an old PPC machine you feel like dusting off to enjoy a low-powered modern workflow, NetBSD may be your AI-code-free jam. Its great to see old hardware still doing real work. If youd rather relive the glory days, you can plug that PPC into a wayback proxy to browse like its 2005 again. If you get bored of nostalgia, theres always MorphOS, which still targets PPC."}

However, looking at scrolling numbers gets old fast, and you will soon want to visualize them and store them  which is why experienced makers tend to have a few graph-drawing and data-collecting tools handy, ready to be plugged in and launched at a moments notice. Well, if you dont yet have such a tool in your arsenal, listen to this 16-minute talk by [Alex Whittemore] to learn about a whole bunch of options you might not even know you had!\nFor a start, theres the Arduino Serial Plotter that you get for free with your Arduino IDE install, but [Alex] also reminds us of the Mu editors serial plotter  about the same in terms of features, but indisputably an upgrade in terms of UX. Its not the only plotter in town, either  Better Serial Plotter is a wonderful standalone option, with a few features that supercharge it, as [Alex] demonstrates! You dont have to stop here, however  we cant always be tethered to our devices debugging ports, after all.\nWith this in mind, [Alex] reminds us all about platforms like Tasmota and HomeAssistant that bring datalogging and graphing to our fingertips, and he shows us us how easy it is to set up a filament drying monitor with these, spending hardly any time on software and yet getting all the features we could wish for. With these platforms, its never been easier to build cool things quickly, to the point you can spend about an hour and build something that will then serve you years  and Grafana is, perhaps, the ultimate platform when it comes to aggregating data.\n[Alex] quickly goes over what you need to install Grafana, and then shows us why you want to install it  with Grafana, collecting data from myriad sources becomes a breeze and a satisfying goal by itself, and you end up learning things you would never learn otherwise. He shows us some examples  for instance, by feeding battery voltage data from his sensor, he could figure out that one of them has a noisy power supply. Collecting RSSI data while querying your wireless sensors can be useful for tracking down sources of interference.\nWhichever goal youre pursuing with your device, theres a little bit for everyone in Alexs talk  you should check it out to be prepared for the next time youre looking at a serial terminal with numbers scrolling by, thinking of the best way to wrangle these numbers into a graph!\n\nAnd speaking of Supercon, get your tickets already!", "title": "DIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u8868\u793a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "body": "\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u958b\u3044\u3066\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u6570\u5024\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3059\u3050\u306b\u98fd\u304d\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3089\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3057\u3066\u4fdd\u5b58\u3057\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3001\u7d4c\u9a13\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3092\u63cf\u753b\u3057\u3001\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3089\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u89e6\u308c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3092\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u4f5c\u308b\u306e\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u8868\u793a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3082\u3063\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\uff01\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3088\u3046\uff01\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u8868\u793a\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3082\u3063\u3068\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\uff01\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u8868\u793a\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\uff01\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u96c6\u7a4d\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3001Grafana\u306e\u5229\u70b9"]}

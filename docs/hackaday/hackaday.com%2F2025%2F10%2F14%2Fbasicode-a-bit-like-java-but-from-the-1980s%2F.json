They all spoke some variant of BASIC, yet were wildly incompatible with each other regardless. BASICODE was a neat solution to this, acting as an early compatibility standard and abstraction layer. It was essentially a standardized BASIC subset with a few extra routines specialized per platform.\nBut that\u2019s only part of the story. The BASICODE standard program was invented by Dutch radio engineer Hessel de Vries, who worked for the Dutch national radio broadcaster Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS). It was designed to be broadcast over FM radio! The idea of standardization and free national deployment was brilliant and lasted until 1992, when corporate changes and technological advancements ultimately led to its decline.\n\nThe way this was achieved was to firstly use only the hardware instructions that were common among all the computers, which meant BASICODE applications couldnt utilize graphics, sound, or even local storage. This may seem very limiting, but theres still a lot you can do with that, especially if you dont have to write it yourself, pay for it, or even leave the room! First, the BASICODE program needed to be loaded from local storage, which, when started, allowed the import of the BASICODE application that you previously recorded off the radio. Its kind of like a manually loaded bootloader, except it includes an additional software library that the application can use.\nLater versions of the standard included storage handling (or an emulation of it), basic monochrome graphics, and eventually sound support. The linked Wikipedia article mentions a list of about 23 BASICODE platforms; however, since there is a standard, you could easily create your own with some effort. In addition to allowing users to send application programs, BASICODE also enabled the reading of FM-broadcast journals, which were transmissions of news, programming tutorials, and other documents that might interest BASICODE users. It was an interesting concept that this writer had never encountered at the time, but thats not surprising since only one country adopted it.\nIf this has got you hankering for the good old days, before the internet, when it was just you, your trusty machine and your own imagination, then we think the ten-line BASIC competition might be of interest. Dont have such a machine, but have a web browser? (we know you do), then check this out. Finally, if you want to see something really crazy (for a BASIC program), then weve got that covered as well.\nThanks to [Suren Y] for sending this in!"}

The next town over had what I thought at the time was a big library, but it was actually more like my town had a tiny library, and the next one over had an actual small library. When I left to go to University, I found out what a real library looked like, and I was mesmerized. Books! Lots of books, many of them written in the current decade. My grades probably suffered from the amount of time I spent in the library reading things that didnt directly relate to my classes. But there was one thing I found that would turn out to be life-changing: A real computer magazine. Last month, Harry McCracken pointed out that the last two widely-distributed American consumer computer magazines ceased paper publication. It is the end of an era, although honestly, it is more like a comatose patient expiring than a shocking and sudden demise.\nDr. Dobbs first issue was far from the slick commercial magazine it would become.\nActually, before I had gone to college, I did have a subscription to Kilobaud, and I still have some copies of those. No offense to Wayne Green, but Kilobaud wasnt that inspiring. It was more an extension of his magazine 73, and while I enjoyed it, it didnt get me dreaming. Dr. Dobbs Journal  the magazine I found in the stacks of my Universitys library  was tangibly different. There was an undertone of changing the world. We werent sure why yet, but we knew that soon, everyone would have a computer. Maybe theyd balance their checkbook or store recipes. A few people already saw the potential of digital music reproduction, although, I must admit, it was so poor at the time, I couldnt imagine who would ever care.\nI say it was life-changing to discover the few issues of Dr. Dobbs that were published back then because I would go on to contribute to Dr. Dobbs throughout its storied history. I wrote the infamous DOS extender series, produced special issues, and, when it went mostly digital, was the embedded system blogger for them for more years than I care to admit. In fact, I have the dubious distinction of having the final blog posted; although the website has suffered enough bit rot, Im not sure any of it has survived other than, maybe, on the Wayback machine. While I wasnt with the magazine for its entire 38-year run, I read it for at least 35 and had some function there for about 24 of those.\n\n$2 bought a lot of computer magazine in 1977!\nLike a lot of nostalgia, you miss it, but it isnt coming back. You can argue for or against it, but it doesnt really matter.\nWhat I think Harry got right his thought piece, though, is that while digital distribution and access are awesome  look at Hackaday, for example  the magazine industry failed to figure out how to stay solvent. McCracken points out that substantial ad revenue fueled huge test labs and hardline investigative journalism in addition to the physical printing. Dont forget that old-school magazines never made money from your subscriptions either, it was all in the ads. Now, it is hard to generate that kind of revenue and, therefore, to provide those kinds of services. So even if you prefer digital  I do  the big money is mostly gone and gone forever, it seems.\nHard to imagine if the lads needed a day job\nImagine a world where music is easily distributed for free. Youd hear a lot more music, and, in fact, you do today because independent artists can easily reach listeners directly. But how would the Beatles catalog be different if George, Paul, John, and Ringo needed day jobs? Youd imagine they might produce less and maybe even very different music.\nThen again, day jobs may be in short supply soon, too, at least the ones a bunch of young musicians might take. Order taker at a fast food restaurant? Thatll be AI soon enough. Fry cook? Thats already probably a robot arm.\nYou have to wonder if the destruction of traditional media  TV, movie theaters, magazines, newspapers, books, and record labels  will lead to a different way to compensate creators fairly or if the jobs related to creation will just eventually dwindle to nothing but volunteers. Either way, the days of the big computer magazine is gone, just like the days you could make a living harvesting ice."}

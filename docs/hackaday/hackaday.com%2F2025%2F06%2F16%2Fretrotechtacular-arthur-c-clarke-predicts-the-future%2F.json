Few people can claim as much success as Arthur C. Clarke, the famous science and science fiction author. Thanks to the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Company, we can see what Sir Arthur thought about the future in 1964 and then ten years later in 1974.\nPerhaps his best-known prediction was that of communication satellites, but he called quite a few other things, too. Like all prognosticators, he didnt bat a thousand, and he missed a wrinkle or two, but overall, he has a very impressive track record.\n\nHorizon\nIn the 1964 BBC show,\u00a0Horizon: The Knowledge Explosion, Clarke himself talked about how hard it is to predict the future. He then goes on to describe ultra-modern cities prior to the year 2000. However, he thought that after the year 2000, we wont care about cities. Well communicate with each other without regard to location. Shades of the Internet and cell phone!\nHe clearly saw the work-from-home revolution. However, he also thought that wed enslave other animals, whichmercifullydidnt come to pass. His thoughts on computers were much more on point, although we still dont quite have what he thought we would.\nDirect information dumps to your brain are probably not happening anytime soon. Suspended animation isnt very popular, either. Of course, all of this could still happen, and it would be totally spooky if hed been 100% right.\nTo wrap up, he talks about a replicator when K. Eric Drexler was not even ten years old. We wont say he called out the 3D printer, exactly, but he was on the track.\n\nThe Home Computer\nFast forward to 1974. A science reporter brought his son with him to an old-school mainframe room and pointed out to Clarke that in the year 2001, the boy would be an adult. Clarke predicted that the boy would have a computer in his house that would connect to other computers to get all the information he needed.\nOnce again, Clarke was really interested in being able to work from anywhere in the world. Of course, he moved to Sri Lanka and still managed to work, so maybe he just thought we should all enjoy the same privilege.\n\nTwo Years Later\nIn 1976, Clarke spoke with an ATT interviewer about the future. He clearly saw the Internet for news and communications with  you guessed it  working from home.\nHe also brought up the smart watch, another invention to add to his yes column. About the only thing in that interview that we havent had luck with yet is contact with extraterrestrials.\n\nOur Guess\nWe try not to make too many predictions. But we are going to guess that at least some of Clarkes predictions are yet to come. There is one thing we are pretty sure of, though. When anyone predicts the future  even Clarke  they rarely see the gritty details. Sure, he saw the cell phone, but not the cell phone plan. Or malware. Or a host of other modern problems that would perplex anyone back in the 1960s.\nClarke has a better track record than most. We love looking at what people thought wed be doing here in the future."}

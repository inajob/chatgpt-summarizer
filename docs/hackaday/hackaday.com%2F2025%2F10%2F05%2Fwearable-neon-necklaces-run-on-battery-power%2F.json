[James Akers] has gone the other route with a fashionable build, creating little wearable neon necklaces that glow beautifully in just the same way.\nAiming for small scale, [James] began with 6 mm blue phosphor glass tube, which was formed to reference Pink Pony Club, one of Chappell Roans more popular songs. The glass was then filled with pure neon up to a relatively low pressure of just 8 torr. This was an intentional choice to create a more conductive lamp that would be easier to run off a battery supply. The use of pure neon also made the tubes easy to repair in the event they had a leak and needed a refill. A Midget Script gas tube power supply is used to drive the tiny tubes from DC power. In testing, the tubes draw just 0.78 amps at 11.8 volts. Its not a light current draw, but for neon, its pretty good\u2014and you could easily carry a battery pack to run it for an hour or three without issue.\nIf youre not a glass blower, fear not\u2014you can always make stuff that has a similar visual effect with some LEDs and creativity. Meanwhile, if youve got your own neon creations on the go\u2014perhaps for Halloween?\u2014dont hesitate to light up the tipsline!", "title": "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u306eDIY", "body": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002 LED\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u306eDIY", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u7167\u660e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u5439\u304d\u4e0d\u8981\uff01LED\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u3084\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

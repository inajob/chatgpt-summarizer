Inspired by [Jeremiah Denton] blinking in Morse code on a televised interview, [MBW] designed an ESP32-based device to decode blinks into words.\nWhile an ESP32 offers Bluetooth for simulating a keyboard and has a relatively low power draw, getting a proper blink detection system to run at 20 frames per second in a constrained environment is challenging. Earlier attempts used facial landmarks to try and determine, based on ratios, whether an eye was open or closed. A cascade detector combined with an XGBoost classifier offered excellent performance but struggled when the eye wasnt centered. Ultimately a 5050, 4-layer CNN in TensorFlow Lite processes the camera frames, producing a single output, eye open or closed. For debugging purposes, it streams camera frames over Wi-Fi with annotations via OpenCV, though getting OpenCV to compile for ESP32 was also nontrivial.\n[MBW] trained the model using the MRL dataset and then quantized to int8. Getting the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi stacks to run concurrently was a bit of a pain, as was managing RAM. After exhausting SRAM and IRAM, [MBW] had to move to PRAM. The entire system is built into some lightweight goggles and makes for a fairly comfortable experience.\nWhile TensorFlow and microcontrollers might seem like a bit of an odd couple, at the end of the day, the inference engine is just doing some math on an array of inputs with some weights. Weve even seen TensorFlow Lite on a Commodore 64. If you dont know about [Admiral Jerimiah Denton] we can shed some light on it for you.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u3092\u6587\u5b57\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9 ", "body": "ESP32\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u3092\u6587\u5b57\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002OpenCV\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Wi-Fi\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3001\u8a8d\u8b58\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u306fMRL\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002PRAM\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u8efd\u91cf\u306a\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u3092\u6587\u5b57\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9 ", "4\u5c64CNN\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u8efd\u91cf\u306a\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9 ", "\u6b8b\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3000", "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u773c\u77bc\uff08\u304c\u3093\u3051\u3093\uff09\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

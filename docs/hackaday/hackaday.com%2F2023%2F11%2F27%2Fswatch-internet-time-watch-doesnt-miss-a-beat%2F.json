Such is the case with Swatchs Internet time, which is told in something called .beats. Rather than using hours and minutes, the solar day in the .beat system is divided into 1,000 parts equal to one minute in the French Revolutionary decimal time system, or 1 minute and 26.4 seconds of standard time.\nSwatch came up with .beats to sell their special line of .beats watches. But they werent the only ones to divide the solar day this way. A few months before Swatchs announcement of .beats time, a Argentinian drummer named [Charly Alberti] came up with the same idea and created a website for it to display the current Internet time of day.\nThe point of all this is that [Roni Bandini] has created an homage to both .beats and [Charly] in the form of a small clock. The main brain is a Seeed Studio Xiao nRF52840, with a Xiao TFT round display to show the time as well as a tribute to [Charly]. The 3D-printed stand incorporates a cylindrical power source. We think the black and white images, which [Roni] created with Dall-e, look fantastic.\nInterestingly enough, the Xiao has no Internet connectivity; the time is set manually via hard-coded variable, and then the displays RTC keeps track of the seconds and convert them to Internet time. Check out the brief build video after the break.\nInterested in regular old metric time? Heres a modern metric clock.\n\n"}

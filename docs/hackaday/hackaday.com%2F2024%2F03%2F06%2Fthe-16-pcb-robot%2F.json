[Concrete Dog] has a new open source design for stoRPer that uses a PC board as the base. The board has a Raspberry Pi Pico and motor drivers. The modular design allows you to add to it easily and use custom wheels. The video below shows some treaded wheels and some mechanum wheels with gears.\nThere are mounting holes for sensors and also a way to put another deck above to hold other circuits, power, or whatever you like. Theres lots you could do with this as a starting point.\n\nSome of the parts are 3D printed, like the motor mounts, for example. This offers some flexibility on motors. There are even files for printing PLA wheels with TPU treads that look like they would work well.\nThe idea is that with a 3D printer and the PC board, you should be able to build something easily. Obviously, youll need to find options for motors. Still, with a populated board, many other parts are printable or easy to repurpose. For example, the video mentions using repurposed vape batteries as a power source.\nWe were a little disappointed there was no video of the little robots doing anything, but if youve programmed these sorts of robots before, you know they can be a lot of fun and very capable, especially with a Pi Pico on board.\nYou could argue that you dont need four wheels to do this. That does require strange wheels, though, and we bet the stoRPer will do better on terrain with the right wheels, too.\n"}

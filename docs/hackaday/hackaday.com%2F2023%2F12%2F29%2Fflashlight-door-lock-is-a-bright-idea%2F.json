You could use a keypad, an RFID card, a fingerprint or retina scan, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the list goes on. You could even use a regular old metal key. But none of these may be as secure as [mircemk]s Arduino-based door lock that employs a smartphones flashlight as a pass code.\nAt first blush, this seems horribly insecure. Use a plain old flashlight to open a door? Come on. But the key is in the software. In fact, between the typed-in pass code and the flash of light it generates, this lock kind of has two layers of security.\nHeres whats going on: inside the accompanying smart phone application, theres a list of passwords. Each of these passwords corresponds to a flash of light in milliseconds. Enter the correct password to satisfy the Arduino, and the phones flashlight is activated for the appropriate number of milliseconds to unlock the door.\nAs youll see in the video below, simply flashing the light manually doesnt unlock the door, and neither does entering one of the other, bogus passwords. Although it does activate the flashlight each time, they dont have the appropriate light-time length defined.\nHardware-wise, there is an Arduino Nano Every in charge of the LDR module that reads the flashlight input and the 12 V relay that unlocks the door. Be sure to check it out it the video after the break.\nIf you want to keep your critters from bringing wild critters back inside, check out this Wi-Fi cat door that lets you have a look at what might be dangling from their jaws before unlocking the door.\n\n"}

[Michael Pick] wanted to build something altogether more devastating. To that end, he created a rocket launcher with an advanced air burst capability, intended to take out enemies behind cover.\nUnlike Nerfs own rocket launchers, this build doesnt just launch a bigger foam dart. Instead, it launches an advanced smart projectile that releases lots of smaller foam submunitions at a set distance after firing.\nThe rocket launcher itself is assembled out of off-the-shelf pipe and 3D printed components.\u00a0 An Arduino Uno runs the show, hooked up to a Bluetooth module and a laser rangefinder. The rangefinder determines the distance to the target, and the Bluetooth module then communicates this to the rocket projectile itself so it knows when to release its foamy payload after launch. Releasing the submunitions is achieved with a small microservo in the projectile which opens a pair of doors in flight, scattering foam on anyone below. The rockets are actually fired via strong elastic bands, with an electronic servo-controlled firing mechanism.\nWeve featured some great Nerf builds over the years, like this rocket-blasting robot.\n\n", "title": "- \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30a8\u30a2\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fNerf\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u6ce1\u5f3e\u3092\u767a\u5c04\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30a8\u30a2\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fNerf\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5f3e\u982d\u306e\u958b\u767a", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306eNerf\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u8ddd\u96e2\u8a08\u3067\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5c04\u6483\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u5f3e\u3092\u6563\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

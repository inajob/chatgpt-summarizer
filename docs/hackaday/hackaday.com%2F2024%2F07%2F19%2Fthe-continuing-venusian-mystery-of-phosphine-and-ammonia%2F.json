Its a sister planet to Earth and also within relatively easy reach of our instruments and probes, yet we nevertheless know precious little about what is going on its surface or even inside its dense atmosphere. Much of this is of course due to planets like Mars getting all the orbiting probes and rovers scurrying around on its barren, radiation-blasted surface, but we had atmospheric probes descend through Venus atmosphere, so far to little avail. Back in 2020 speculation arose of phosphine being detected in Venus atmosphere, which caused both excitement and a lot of skepticism. Regardless, at the recent National Astronomy Meeting (NAM 2024) the current state of Venusian knowledge was discussed, which even got The Guardian to report on it.\nIn addition to phosphine, theres speculation of ammonia also being detectable from Earth, both of which might be indicative of organic processes and thus potentially life. Related research has indicated that common amino acids essential to life on Earth would be stable even in sulfuric droplets like in Venus atmosphere. After criticism to the original 2020 phosphine article, [Jane S. Greaves] et al. repeated their observations based on feedback, although its clear that the observation of phosphine gas on Venus is not a simple binary question.\nThe same is true of ammonia, which if present in Venusian clouds would be a massive discovery, which according to research by [William Bains] and colleagues in PNAS could explain many curious observations in Venus atmosphere. With so much uncertainty with remote observations, its clear that the only way that we are going to answer these questions is with future Venus missions, which sadly remain rather sparse.\nIf theres indeed life on Venus, itll have a while longer to evolve before we can go and check it out.", "title": "\u91d1\u661f\u306e\u8b0e\uff1a\u904e\u9177\u306a\u8868\u9762\u3068\u5927\u6c17\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "body": "\u59c9\u59b9\u60d1\u661f\u3067\u3042\u308b\u91d1\u661f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u4e0d\u8db3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u30012020\u5e74\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u691c\u51fa\u3084\u706b\u661f\u3078\u306e\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u304c\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u91d1\u661f\u5927\u6c17\u306f\u6709\u6a5f\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3084\u751f\u547d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u7269\u8a9e\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3082\u5bfe\u8c61\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u91d1\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u89e3\u660e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u5f85\u3061\u3002", "titles": ["\u91d1\u661f\u306e\u8b0e\uff1a\u904e\u9177\u306a\u8868\u9762\u3068\u5927\u6c17\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u91d1\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\uff1a\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u89b3\u6e2c\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d", "2024\u5e74\u306e\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4f1a\u3067\u8b70\u8ad6\u3055\u308c\u305f\u91d1\u661f\u306e\u77e5\u898b", "\u91d1\u661f\u5927\u6c17\u306e\u751f\u547d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u691c\u51fa", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u91d1\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1a\u8b0e\u591a\u304d\u60d1\u661f\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

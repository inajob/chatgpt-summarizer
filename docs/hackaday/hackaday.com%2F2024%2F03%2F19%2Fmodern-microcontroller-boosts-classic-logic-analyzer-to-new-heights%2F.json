State of the art in 1975, it looks like glorious Space Age equipment today. He decided to hook it up some modern gear to put it through its paces.\nWanting to give the equipment a proper shakedown, he enlisted a Teensy 4.1 to spit a deluge of logic at the HP unit. The microcontroller was tasked with generating 32 data signals along with two clock outputs to give the analyzer plenty to analyze. The HP 1600A handled this no problem, so [Ted] kept tinkering.\nHis next feat was to explore the addressable MAP function of the unit, which allowed writing to the 6464 pixel display. The Teensy 4.1 was easily able to send images to the display, but [Ted] isnt stopping there. Hes got plans to do the usual thing and get Bad Apple going on the hardware.\nGetting a logic analyzer to analyze logic isnt much of a hack, sure. But its instructive of how to approach working with such hardware. If you want to spit a bunch of logic out fast, a Teensy 4.1 is a great choice because its got a ton of IO and a ton of clock cycles to tickle it with.\nWe enjoyed seeing this old piece of hardware light up the phosphors once more. If youve got your own projects going on with classic bits of HP test gear, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

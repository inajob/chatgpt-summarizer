In fact, you\u2019ve spotted one of the world\u2019s most bizarre architectural phenomena.\nSantos is an interesting contradiction\u2014its a sunny coastal city with pristine beaches that also plays host to a bustling port. What draws the eye, however, is the skyline\u2014its decidedly askew. This isn\u2019t a Photoshop job or some avant-garde urban planning experiment, either. It\u2019s a consequence of engineering hubris, poor planning, and geology just doing its thing.\n\nSide to Side\nIts easy to spot the lean on the buildings in Santos.

In Santos, though, that sort of thing barely raises an eyebrow. The city is dotted all over with buildings on the tilt. From 2004 to 2012, all 651 beachfront buildings were measured, and all were off-kilter to some degree. Some are just barely leaning over, maybe a couple of inches out of level. A more extreme example, like the Excelsior, measures 1.8 meters out of level. Its a severe tilt that you can spot at an instant.\nSantos didn\u2019t set out to create its very own gallery of modern Leaning Towers. Most of the city\u2019s lopsided skyscrapers were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, during a period when Brazils building codes were more permissive.\nIts not just one building, either, its around 100 or so. Credit: janhamlet, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\nDevelopers eager to cash in slapped together high-rise buildings with foundations only a few meters deep. This is perfectly valid when construction takes place directly on solid bedrock, but Santos sadly lacks such a convenient base. The ground is instead a bed of sand, seven meters deep, which sits upon a deeper bed of clay. Constructing the buildings with deep foundations down to the bedrock below would have avoided this problem, albeit at some expense. Instead, developers just pushed forward with the cheaper option.\nFast forward a few decades, and the problems are obvious. Over time, the towers weight tended to push out water from the clay below, leading to the buildings sinking somewhat, and often quite unevenly. The result is a skyline that looks like it\u2019s leaning with the wind, with around 100 buildings visibly off-kilter to the naked eye. Its a unique sight\u2014and a rare one at that. Where else will you see modern skyscrapers looking like theyre about to fall right over?\nThe geology of Santos, combined with engineering decisions, lead to the problem.

The buildings are regularly inspected and maintained, a sage decision given the ominous angles of lean. So far, there havent been any major catastrophies, so much as minor inconveniences. Problems with stuck doors and windows are common, and in many cases theres an easily-detectable lean when walking around inside. Some owners choose to compensate by levelling their floor, though its usually still obvious theres a problem whenever looking at the walls.\nOver the years, there\u2019s been talk of fixing the leaning buildings. Engineers have explored various means of jacking them back upright. Sadly, the cost of leveling even a single building is astronomical, and so far, only two have been corrected. Getting the buildings back into plumb involved huge hydraulic jacks, and the construction of new subfoundations able to properly support the building without further subsidence.\u00a0 This cost was, at the very least, offset to some degree by the fact the value of the apartments in the buildings rose significantly after correction. Still, for the rest of the buildings in Santos, though, its pretty much lean or bust.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts perhaps odd that Santos hasnt become a global tourist trap like Pisa. Perhaps the answer lies in the scale of the leaning problem. Pisa\u2019s single iconic tower is a historical oddity, a relic of medieval miscalculation. Santos\u2019 slanting skyline, on the other hand, is a modern engineering mistake that doesn\u2019t have the same romantic aura.\u00a0 Nor are the leaning building suitable as a tourist attraction, given the residents wouldnt appreciate the intrusion of visitors marvelling at their wonky stairwells. Still, if you\u2019re in the neighborhood, it\u2019s worth a look. The beachfront is lined with these leaning giants, creating a surreal backdrop that\u2019s equal parts charming and unsettling.\nFor now, Santos\u2019 leaning towers stand as a cautionary tale. Cutting corners in construction can leave a lasting mark\u2014sometimes a very obvious one. Next time you\u2019re marveling at a city\u2019s skyline, spare a thought for the ground beneath it. You never know what secrets it\u2019s hiding\u2014or how much it\u2019s shifting underfoot."}

Feel free to add your suggestions!\nIf youre interested in KiCad you might like to read about whats new in version 9 and how to customize your KiCad shortcut keys for productivity.\n", "title": "- KiCad\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u306eKiCad\u56de\u8def\u56f3\u6539\u5584\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- KiCad\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9", "- Andrew Greenberg\u304c\u6559\u3048\u308b\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306aKiCad\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\uff1a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u8003\u616e\u4e8b\u9805", "- KiCad\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

If you suffer from cold, stiff hands, you know how difficult it can be to work comfortably on a computer all day. Somehow, all that typing and mousing does little to warm things up. What you need are hand warmers, obviously, and they might as well be smart and made to fit your hands.\nFifteen-year-old [Printerforge] created these bad boys in an effort to learn how to code LCDs and control heat like Magneto controls ferrous metals. Thanks to digital control, they can heat up to specific temperatures, and they happen to run for a long time.\nPower-wise, these warmers use a 18650 cell and a TP4056 charging module. Everything is controlled by an Arduino Nano, which reads from both a thermistor and a potentiometer to control the output.\n[Printerforge] really thought this project through, as youll see in the Instructable. Theres everything from a table of design requirements to quick but thorough explanations of nichrome wire and basic electronic theory.\nAnd then theres the material consideration. [Printerforge] decided that polymer clay offers the best balance of heat conductivity and durability. They ended up with two styles  flat, and joystick grip. The best part is, everything can fit in a generous pocket.\nClay is good for a lot of things, like making the perfect custom mouse."}

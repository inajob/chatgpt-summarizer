Meanwhile, [Nick Bild] has managed to get something similar running on a Commodore 64. (via Toms Hardware).\nA figure generated by [Nick]s C64. We shall name him Sword Guy!As you might imagine, [Nicks] AI image generator isnt churning out 4K cyberpunk stills dripping in neon. Instead, he aimed at a smaller target, more befitting the Commodore 64 itself. His image generator creates 88 game sprites instead.\n[Nicks] model was trained on 100 retro-inspired sprites that he created himself. He did the training phase on a modern computer, so that the Commodore 64 didnt have to sweat this difficult task on its feeble 6502 CPU. However, its more than capable of generating sprites\u00a0using the model, thanks to some BASIC code that runs off of the training data. Right now, it takes the C64 about 20 minutes to run through 94 iterations to generate a decent sprite.\n88 sprites are generally simple enough that you dont need to be an artist to create them. Nonetheless, [Nick] has shown that modern machine learning techniques can be run on slow archaic hardware, even if there is limited utility in doing so.

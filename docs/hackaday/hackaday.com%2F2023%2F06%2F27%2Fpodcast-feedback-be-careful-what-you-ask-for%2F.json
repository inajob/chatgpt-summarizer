You know the kind  you get a shipping notice from UPS with the faux-excited Your package is arriving today! message, but youre sure you havent ordered anything in a while. You check your Amazon order history, find nothing pending, and puzzle over who could be sending you a package. What could it be? A gift from a secret admirer, perhaps?\nAnd so it was with me as I waited for the UPS driver to make her rounds of our neighborhood and drop the package off on our front steps. Surprised at its size, I hurriedly brought it inside, zipped open the box, and pulled away the packing to reveal\n\nWheat Thins and mayonnaise?\nStick with me, I swear this has a Hackaday angle.\nI was perplexed, to say the least. Flummoxed, even. There was no information in the package or on the shipping label to indicate who sent it, or more importantly, why. Its certainly not something Id order from Amazon; I try to avoid snack crackers and chips, and Im not a big fan of that kind of sandwich spread. And even if I would buy such things, I certainly wouldnt have ordered them from Amazon  I find their prices on food and household goods egregiously high. And besides, nothing like this was in my order history.\nI posted the picture on the family Discord; maybe my wife or one of the kids got a weird case of the munchies? No dice, although my daughter offered that God is telling you something. What exactly the divine message would be, or why He chose Amazon as His messenger, she didnt speculate. But the idea that it was a message kind of triggered something in the back of my head. Wheat Thins and mayo. This means something \nThe day ended without any satisfying resolution to the mystery, and as soon as my son and younger daughter saw the Wheat Thins on Discord, they scampered to the kitchen and absconded with them for their nightly snack; the mayo remained unmolested. But in the morning, I got a DM on Hackaday.io that explained everything:\n\nI had totally forgotten about that! In case you missed it, when Elliot and I did the podcast a few weeks back, one of the articles we discussed was Jenny Lists analysis of\u00a0Amazon and Googles vision for a home assistant future and how it hasnt quite worked out. Its a great article, and you should really check it out, but in our podcast discussion  which starts at about the 50-minute mark if you want to skip ahead  I said that the Amazon voice assistant model of being able to order massive amounts of stuff doesnt work for me, because I dont need Amazon to send me Wheat Thins, or mayonnaise. And if I recall correctly, I even made a crack about how it would be funny if someones Alexa had just ordered me some Wheat Thins and mayo; wisely, though, Elliot left that bit on the cutting room floor.\nSo, the mystery was solved, but apparently [JonKangas] had some second thoughts about his admittedly hilarious gesture:\n\nIll admit that to some degree, it was a little unsettling. There was a time when I probably would have soaked an unsolicited package like that in a barrel of water for a few hours before opening it, but Ive mellowed a bit over the years. Honestly, the thought of what would have happened if my mom got a package like this was more unnerving; shed probably have spent the whole day on the phone trying to figure out who sent the package. Really, I was just impressed with his commitment to a practical joke based on an obscure reference  comedy gold!\nBut then I got to thinking: How did he find me? I guess its not that hard, really, since my street address is in the FCC database thanks to my amateur radio license. Even without that, it wouldnt be difficult for a reasonably resourceful Hackaday reader to figure out where I live, especially since Ive probably inadvertently doxxed myself a dozen times over the eight years (!) Ive worked for Hackaday.\nSo, not a message from God, but definitely a message, and a pretty darn funny one at that. Hats off to [Jon] for the follow-through on this one, and for giving my family a little bit of a head-scratcher around the dinner table. Ive always thought our readers  and listeners  are the smartest, coolest people on the planet, and this one really seals the deal. And a sincere thanks for the Wheat Thins, which the kids much appreciated. The mayo, though? Thanks anyway, but thats going to the food bank.", "title": "\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u306aAmazon\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5c4a\u3044\u305f", "body": "\u8b0e\u306eAmazon\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5c4a\u304f\u3002\u914d\u9001\u4e88\u5b9a\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u3066\u3082\u4f55\u3082\u6ce8\u6587\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u958b\u3051\u308b\u3068 Wheat Thins \u3068\u30de\u30e8\u30cd\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3093\u306a\u4e2d\u3001Hackaday.io\u304b\u3089\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5c4a\u304d\u3001Jenny List\u306e\u5206\u6790\u3092\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u6271\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5224\u660e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u82e5\u5e72\u306e\u4e0d\u5b89\u8996\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3044\u305f\u305a\u3089\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5831\u544a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u306aAmazon\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5c4a\u3044\u305f", "\u98df\u6599\u54c1\u304c\u5165\u3063\u305fAmazon\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u8b0e", "Amazon\u306e\u914d\u9001\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u9055\u548c\u611f\u3092\u899a\u3048\u305f", "\u98df\u54c1\u3092\u9ad8\u5024\u3067\u8cb7\u3046Amazon\u3092\u907f\u3051\u3088\u3046", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u304c\u9001\u308b\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u306f\u8981\u6ce8\u610f"]}

Translated to UV-sensitive PLA filament, this means that you can totally use a printed sheet of this material in combination with a 405 nm laser diode to create a display that doesnt look dissimilar to an early CRT. This is exactly what [bitluni] did in a recent video, meshing together said laser diode, UV-sensitive PLA, stepper motors and two mirrors with an Arduino-based controller to create a rather interesting vector display.\nIn the video, [bitluni] goes over the development steps, including a range of improvements like being able to turn off the laser when moving between the end of a line and the beginning of a new one. While the Arduino Nano board does the driving of the stepper motor controllers, an ESP32 provides the drawing instructions. The STL and other project files including Nano  ESP32 firmware can be found on the GitHub project page.\nWhile far from being a practical display with a single-digit Hz refresh rate, it does provide an interesting demonstration of these types of persistence of vision based displays, and without the use of exotic MEMS mirror modules or the like.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fcCRT\u98a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068UV\u611f\u5fdcPLA\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fcCRT\u98a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "UV\u611f\u53d7\u6027PLA\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8868\u793a\u6280\u8853", "Arduino\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30e2", "bitluni\u304c\u793a\u3059\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5f0f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "GitHub\u304b\u3089\u5165\u624b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u89e3\u8aac"]}

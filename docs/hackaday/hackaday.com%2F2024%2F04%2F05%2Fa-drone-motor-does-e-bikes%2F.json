Of course, their different applications make them anything but equivalent, as the bike motor is designed for high torque at low speed while the drone motor has very little torque but plenty of speed. Can the drone motor do the bike motors job? [Pro Know] makes it happen, with a set of speed reducing and torque increasing belts.\nThe build takes a pretty ordinary bicycle, and replaces the rear brake disk with a large pulley for a toothed belt, which drives a smaller pulley, and through a shaft another set of pulleys to the drone motor. The bracket to hold all this and the very large pulley on the wheel are all 3D printed in PLA-carbon fiber mix.\nWhen its assembled, it runs the bike from a small lithium ion pack. Thats not unexpected, but if were honest wed have our doubts as to whether this would survive the open road. Its evidently a novelty for a YouTube video, and wed be interested to see how hot the little motor became. However whats perhaps more interesting is the choice of filament.\nCould carbon fibre PLA be strong enough to print a toothed belt pulley? Wed be interested to know more. We saw the same filament combo being tested recently, after all.\n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3068\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u7d04500\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u7528\u9014\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308b\u3002Pro Know\u304c\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3068\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u5897\u52a0\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3067\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092YouTube\u3067\u516c\u958b\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u88fd\u3002\u5f37\u5ea6\u306f\uff1f", "titles": ["\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af vs. \u9ad8\u901f\uff1a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u7528\u9014", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u6df7\u5408\u306ePLA\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8a66\u307f", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

Its similar in vibe to\u00a0Dance Dance Revolution and In The Groove, but it has an extra arrow panel to make life harder.\u00a0[Rodrigo Alfonso] loved it so much, he ported it to the Game Boy Advance.\nThe port looks fantastic, with all the fast-moving arrows and lovely sprite-based graphics you could dream of. But more than that, [Rodrigos] port is very fully featured. It doesnt rely on tracked or sampled music, instead using actual GSM audio files for the songs.\nIt can also accept input from a PS/2 keyboard, and you can even do multiplayer over the GBAs Wireless Adapter. Whats even cooler is that some of the games neat features have been broken out into separate libraries so other developers can use them. If you need a Serial Port library for the GBA, or a way to read the SD card on flash carts, [Rodrigo] has put the code on GitHub.\nAs you might have guessed, this isnt the first time [Rodrigo] has pushed the limits on what Nintendos 32-bit handheld can do.\n\n"}

[sjm4306] chose to go a relatively conventional route, making something that approximates a traditional analog timepiece. However, he did it using LED filaments to create a striking and unique design. Thus the name\u2014FilamenTIME!\nLED filaments are still relatively new on the scene. Theyre basically a bunch of tiny LCDs mounted in a single package to create a single filament of light that appears continuous. Its great if you want to create a bar of light without messing around with populating tons of parts and having to figure out diffusion on your own.\n[sjm4306] used them to create glowing bar elements in a clock for telling the time. The outer ring contains 60 filaments for the 60 minutes in an hour, while the inner ring contains 12 filaments to denote the hours themselves. To handle so many LEDs, there are 9 shift registers on board. Theyre driven by an ATmega328P which runs the show, with a DS3232MZ real-time clock onboard for keeping time.\u00a0 As you might imagine, creating such a large circular clock required a large PCB\u2014roughly a square foot in size. It doesnt come cheap, though [sjm4306] was lucky enough to have sponsorship to cover the build. [sjm4306] is still working on the firmware, and hopes to build a smaller, more compact version, which should cut costs compared to the large single board.\nIts a neat clock, and wed know, having seen many a timepiece around these parts. Video after the break.\n\n"}

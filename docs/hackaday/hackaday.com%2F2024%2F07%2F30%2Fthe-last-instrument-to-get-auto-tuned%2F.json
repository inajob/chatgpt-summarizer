Likewise, the early 2010s was marked by a fairly extreme use of autotune, a technology that allows sounds, especially vocals, to be shifted to precise pitches regardless of the pitch of the original source. In this dark era, a wide swath of instruments and voices on the charts were auto-tuned at some point, although we dont remember this iconic instrument ever being featured among the annals of pitch-shifted pop music.\nThe auto-tuned kazoo created by [Guy Dupont] does its pitch corrections on-the-fly thanks to a built-in ESP-32-S3 microcontroller which, through a microphone inside the kazoo, listens for note of the musicians hum and corrects it to the closest correctly pitched note. Once it identifies the note it outputs a kazoo-like pitch-corrected note from a small speaker, also hidden inside the instrument. It does this fast enough for live performances using the YIN fundamental frequency estimation algorithm. Not only can the kazoo be played directly, but thanks to the implementation of MIDI it can be used to control other synthesizers or be played through other means as a stand-alone synthesizer.\nMuch like the 80s, where the use of synthesizers relaxed from excessive use on nearly every instrument on every track throughout the decade to a more restrained use as the decade faded, so has autotune been toned down in most music to be more subtly applied. But like our enjoyment of heavily synthesized tunes outside the 80s like those by Daft Punk or The Weeknd, we can also appreciate something heavily auto-tuned outside of the 2010s like a stylized kazoo or a T-Pain-style guitar effects pedal.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u697d\u5668\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u97f3\u697d\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3084\u30d8\u30a2\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u306e\u904e\u5270\u306a\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u7279\u5fb4\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u30012010\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u671f\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6fc0\u3057\u304f\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u3002\u201cGuy Dupont\u201d\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u306f\u697d\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u3068ESP-32-S3\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u7a0b\u88dc\u6b63\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u697d\u5668\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "ESP-32-S3\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc", "\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u6f14\u594f\u3084\u5408\u6210\u97f3\u6e90\u5236\u5fa1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc", "2010\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u671f\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5de7\u5999\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u97f3\u697d\u6587\u5316\u306e\u5909\u9077"]}

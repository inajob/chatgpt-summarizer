Its also relatively straightforward to do the same for AM, and if you take a look through AliExpress youll find some modules which do just that. [Doz Television Workshop] has one, and hes treated us to a thorough run-down of its design before addressing some of its shortcomings.\nAn AM transmitter is simple enough, in this case an oscillator and buffer driving a class C power amplifier. The modulation is applied by a transistor in series with the power amp, driven from an audio amplifier. Some attention has gone into the design of this one, with a proper output filter and plenty of room for tweaking to achieve proper levels and modulation density. There are some problems though  The modulator transistor is mounted upside down for the heatsink, and the frequency stability leaves something to be desired. [Doz] fixes the heatsink mounting and incorporates a DDS frequency synthesizer with an Arduino for control.\nMore after the break\n\nThe resulting transmitter is better, but theres still a problem. The limitations of AM broadcasting demanded both limiting and pre-emphasis, which he applies in software through one of the more powerful Teensy boards. We have to admit wed have tried to do the job the analogue way, but thats merely preference.\nThis board looks to be a good solution for an AM radio collector wishing to use their sets in an age of declining AM transmission. It should be legal under Part 15 for Americans, but as he points out its not for Brits. We suspect such a low-powered device wouldnt attract adverse attention though. The video is below the break.\nIf you dont need so much quality, its possible to do the job in a much less elegant manner.\n"}

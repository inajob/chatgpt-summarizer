Not only is it perfectly accessible to a home experimenter, his initial results look like they have some promise, as well.\n[KB9ENS] read about a type of ultra-white paint formulation that not only reflects heat, but is able to radiate it into space, cooling the painted surface to below ambient temperature. This is intriguing because while commercial paints can insulate and reflect heat, they cannot make a surface cooler than its surroundings.\nAnecdotally speaking, this painted battery section of a solar recharger gets too hot to touch in full sunlight. But when painted over, it was merely warm.\nWhat really got [KB9ENS] thinking was that at its core, the passively-cooling paint in the research is essentially a whole lot of different particle sizes of barium sulfate (BaSO\u2084) mixed into an acrylic binder. These two ingredients are remarkably accessible. A half-pound of BaSO\u2084 from a pottery supply shop was only a few dollars, and a plain acrylic base is easily obtained from almost any paint or art supplier.\n[KB9ENS] decided to mix up a crude batch of BaSO\u2084 paint, apply it to some things, and see how well it compared to other paints and coatings. He whetted the BaSO\u2084 with some isopropyl alcohol to help it mix into the base, and made a few different concentrations. A 60% concentration by volume seemed to give the best overall results.\nTheres no indication of whether any lower-than-ambient cooling is happening, but according to a non-contact thermometer even this homemade mixture does a better job of keeping sunlight from heating things up compared to similarly-applied commercial paints (although it fared only slightly better than titanium dioxide-based white paint in the initial test.)\n[KB9ENS] also painted the battery section of a solar recharger with his homemade paint and noted that while under normal circumstances  that is to say, in full sunlight  that section becomes too hot to touch, with the paint coating it was merely warm.\nActual passive cooling can do more than just keep something less warm than it would be otherwise. Weve seen it recently used to passively and continuously generate power thanks to its ability to create a constant temperature differential, day and night.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u8d85\u767d\u8272\u5857\u6599\u3067\u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u51b7\u5374\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "body": "\u300cKB9ENS\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u304c\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u5857\u6599\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5857\u6599\u306f\u71b1\u3092\u53cd\u5c04\u3057\u3001\u5468\u56f2\u3088\u308a\u3082\u4f4e\u3044\u6e29\u5ea6\u306b\u51b7\u5374\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u306b\u300c\u30d0\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u786b\u9178\u5869\u300d\u3068\u300c\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u300d\u3092\u6df7\u305c\u305f\u5857\u6599\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u5857\u6599\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u826f\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u51fa\u305f\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u8d85\u767d\u8272\u5857\u6599\u3067\u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u51b7\u5374\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6210\u5206\u3067\u592a\u967d\u71b1\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u6291\u3048\u308b\u5857\u6599\u958b\u767a\uff01", "\u30d0\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u786b\u9178\u5869\u306e\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u5857\u6599\u304c\u5546\u696d\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u4e0a\u56de\u308b\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u767a\u63ee\uff01", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u51b7\u5374\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u65e5\u5e38\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u3088\u308a\u6dbc\u3057\u304f\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u5857\u6599\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u691c\u8a3c\uff01"]}

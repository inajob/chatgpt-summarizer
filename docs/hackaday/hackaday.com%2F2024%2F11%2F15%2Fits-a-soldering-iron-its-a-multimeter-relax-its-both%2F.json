A young person comes to you wanting to get started in the electronic hobby. They ask what five things should they buy to get started. Make your list. Well wait. We bet we can guess at least two of your items: a multimeter, and a soldering iron. [LearnElectroncsRepair] recently showed us a review of the Zotek Zoyi ZT-N2 which is a soldering iron and a multimeter in one unit. You can watch the video review below.\nHonestly, when we heard about this, we didnt think much of the combination. It doesnt seem like having your probe get red hot is a feature. However, the probe tip replaces the soldering iron tip, so you are either soldering or measuring, but not both at the same time.\n\nThe soldering iron part looks a lot like a T100 iron with a USB connector and a little LCD screen. The device is portable, so it has a little cheap soldering iron stand. As a multimeter, it does all the basic tests, but it is only usable for low-voltage applications under 36V.\nThe negative lead plugs into the USB connector, so the meter runs off an internal battery. While it looks like it is usable, we couldnt really think of many cases where this would be handy unless you are really trying to pack a lot in a small space. Wed rather throw a small meter in the bag and call it a day.\nIn 2017, these little soldering irons were a fresh fad. Now, they are pretty common.\n"}

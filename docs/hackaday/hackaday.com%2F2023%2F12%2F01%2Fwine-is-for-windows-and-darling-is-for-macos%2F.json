In case youd wondered, theres a similar tool for when you need to run a MacOS program in your Linux environment. Enter Darling, the translation layer youve needed all along.\nJust as Wine is not an emulator, nor is Darling. As a translation layer, it duplicates functions of the MacOS operating system that programs need to operate but within Linux. Its fast, because its effectively running the MacOS software directly. Initially, Darling was mostly only capable of running MacOS apps at the console level. However, there is rudimentary support for running graphical applications that are based on the Cocoa framework.\nHilariously, if youre into weird recursive situations, you can go deeper and run Darling within Windows Subsystem for Linux, itself running within Windows. Why? Well, youre probably bored or just trying to for the sake of it. Regardless, we dont judge. If youve got your own nifty translation or virtual machine hacks in the works, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

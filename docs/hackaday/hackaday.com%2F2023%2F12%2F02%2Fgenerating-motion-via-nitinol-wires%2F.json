But there are other methods of locomotion available. As [Jamie Matthews] demonstrates, Nitinol wires can be another way to help get things moving.\nNitinol is a type of metal wire made of nickel and titanium that is also known as memory wire, because it can remember its former shape and transition back to it with a temperature change. [Jamie] uses this property to create a simple hand that is actuated by pieces of wire sourced from Amazon. This is actually a neat way to go, as it goes some way to mimicking how our own hands are moved by our tendons.\n[Jamie] does a great job of explaining how to get started with Nitinol and how it works in a practical sense. Weve seen it put to some wacky uses before, too, such as the basis for an airless tire.\n\n", "title": "\u300cNitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u30cb\u30c8\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u624b\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30cb\u30c8\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u6e29\u5ea6\u5909\u5316\u3067\u5143\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u306b\u623b\u308b\u6027\u8cea\u3092\u6301\u3064\u305f\u3081\u3001\u624b\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30cb\u30c8\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u7528\u9014\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cNitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\uff01Nitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u7269\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u300d", "\u300cNitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3068\u7279\u6027\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01Nitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u306e\u52d5\u304b\u3057\u65b9\u300d", "\u300c\u7570\u306a\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff01Nitinol\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u7269\u4f53\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u300d"]}

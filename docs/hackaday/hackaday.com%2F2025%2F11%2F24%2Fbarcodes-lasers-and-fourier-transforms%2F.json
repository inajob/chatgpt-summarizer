On his quest to understand it he runs down a number of rabbit holes, including learning about various barcode formats, doing a teardown of the Telxon LS-201 barcode scanner, and exploring how lasers work. Thats right: lasers!\nHis reason for looking at the Telxon LS-201 barcode scanner is that it has the same type of helium-neon laser as his Bomem DA3 uses. Since hes learning about barcode scanners he thinks its prudent to learn about barcode formats too, and he has a discussion with our very own Adam Fabio about such things, including the UPC-A standard barcodes.\n\nIts fun seeing the mainboard of the Telxon LS-201 sporting the familiar 555 timer, LM393 comparator, and three op-amps: 5532, LF347, and TL062; no discrete logic in sight!

The particular Hackaday article mentioned in the video is this one: The Eloquence Of The Barcode.\nAlso, in the interest of public health and safety, make sure youre wearing laser protection glasses if youre working with laser technology. Even low power lasers can do damage to your eyes. Laser emissions can be invisible to the human eye and you dont have nerves that tell you when your eyeballs are being roasted, so take care out there!\n", "title": "- \u30dc\u30fc\u30e1 DA3\u3068\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "body": "Bomem DA3\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u8a08\u6e2c\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u904e\u7a0b\u3067\u3001\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6280\u8853\u3084\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u63a2\u6c42\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30dc\u30fc\u30e1 DA3\u3068\u30d5\u30fc\u30ea\u30a8\u5909\u63db\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "- \u30c6\u30eb\u30af\u30bd\u30f3 LS-201 \u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30c6ardown", "- \u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u3068UPC-A\u898f\u683c", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u898b\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff1a\u30c6\u30eb\u30af\u30bd\u30f3 LS-201\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u8a73\u7d30", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1a\u4fdd\u8b77\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

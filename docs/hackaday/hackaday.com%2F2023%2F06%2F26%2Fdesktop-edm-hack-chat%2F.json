EDM is the go-to machining method for so many applications, from making complex injection molding tooling to putting impossibly small holes into hardened steel, EDM gets the jobs that make traditional machining techniques weep.\nAt its heart, EDM is really simple; its just making sparks to selectively erode metal. In practice, though, its way more complicated than that. Theres the CNC aspect to control the cutting tool, the dielectric to cool things and flush away the swarf, and the precision control of the electric discharge. Its all just complicated and expensive enough that its hard to find anyone doing EDM on the hobbyist level.\nHard, but not impossible. Desktop EDM is doable, and to help us understand the challenges involved weve invited Cooper Zurad to the Hack Chat. Cooper has quite a bit of experience with the related and somewhat less energetic ECM, or electrochemical machining, and is now turning the knowledge gained there to desktop EDM. Make sure to join us with your questions about machining with electricity.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, June 28 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.\n[Featured image by Qw5646, CC BY-SA 3.0]"}

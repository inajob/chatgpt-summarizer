Thats where [2048bits] snap probe design comes in. With a little additional and inexpensive hardware, one can have all the hands-free probe clamps ones workbench can fit!\nThat first link is where youll find a list of required hardware and the CAD files (in .step format) for the probe itself. The obvious approach to making the pieces would be to 3D print them, but we notice the design  while attractive  looks like a challenging print due to the features. Were not the only ones to see that, and happily theres already a remix by [user_2299476772] aimed at keeping the essential features while making them easier to print.\nIf youre taking a DIY approach to PCB probes, wed like to remind you that one of our readers discovered dental burrs make absolutely fantastic, non-slip probe tips. This seems like a good opportunity to combine two ideas, and having the CAD files for the probe clamp means modification is straightforward. Let us know on the tips line if you get something working!\n[via Hackster]", "title": "- \u624b\u304c\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u306a\u308b\uff012048bits\u306e\u30b9\u30ca\u30c3\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "PCB\u4f5c\u696d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u3067\u6301\u305f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u826f\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6539\u9020\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u624b\u304c\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u306a\u308b\uff012048bits\u306e\u30b9\u30ca\u30c3\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u8a2d\u8a08", "- PCB\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u6b6f\u79d1\u7528\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6ed1\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u5148\u7aef\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- CAD\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

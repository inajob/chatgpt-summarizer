If you find yourself looking for a computer opponent, or you just prefer playing online, you might like this LED chessboard from [DIY Machines] instead.\nAt heart, its basically a regular chessboard with addressable LEDs of the WS2812B variety under each square. The lights are under the command of an Arduino Nano, which is also tasked with reading button inputs from the boards side panel. The Nano is interfaced with a Raspberry Pi, which is the true brains of the operation. The Pi handles chess tasks\u2014checking the validity of moves, acting as a computer opponent, and connecting online for games against other humans if so desired. Everything is wrapped up with 3D printed parts, making this an easy project to build for the average DIY maker.\nThe video tutorial does a great job of covering the design. Its a relatively simple project at heart, but the presentation is great and it looks awfully fun to play with. Weve featured some other great builds from [DIY Machines] before, too. Video after the break.\n"}

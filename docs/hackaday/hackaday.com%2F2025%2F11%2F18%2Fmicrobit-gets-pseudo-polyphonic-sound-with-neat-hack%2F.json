Out of the box, its got a pretty basic sound output feature that can play a single note at a time. However, if youre willing to get a bit tricky, you can do some pseudo-polyphonic stuff as [microbit-noob] explains.\nThe trick to polyphony in a monophonic world? Rapidly alternating between the different notes you want to be playing at the same time. Do this fast enough and it feels like theyre playing together rather than seperately. [microbit-noob] demonstrates how to implement this with a simple function coded for the Micro:bit. Otherwise, it uses the completely stock sound hardware. However, the IR receiver is added to the device in order to allow a simple remote control to be used to command the notes desired, along with some extra tactile buttons to add further control.\nIs it chiptune? Well, its a chip, playing a tune, so yes. Even if it is through a tiny speaker stuck to the PCB. In any case, if youre trying to get some better bleeps and bloops out of the Micro:bit, this is a great place to start.

This one might take the cake. [frydom.john]s excellent UFO is fully programmable and contains about 2000 addressable RGB LEDs, smoke, a laser-lit ramp, and of course, an alien crew.\nUnder the hood of the wooden frame, youll find a Teensy 4.1 running the blinkenlights. Theres also a hacked smoke machine, because whats a UFO without smoke or fog emanating from underneath? There are six PC fans to blow it around and recycle it, and the ramp runs on a linear actuator.\n[frydom.john]s project notes (PDF), which they refer to as scrappy/hacky are also available. We beg to differ a bit on the scrappy/hacky part; its 60 pages long and full of photos and diagrams and charts. Even so, it may not be enough for you to replicate this extraterrestrial vehicle, so [frydom.john] is open to questions. Be sure to check this thing out after the break.\nWant to have your UFO lift off of the ground? Its possible with the Coand\u0103 effect.\n\n"}

The rest is just gravy. In the video you get to see how to use your development tools to create a firmware file suitable for OTA update.\n\nIf youre thinking this all looks a little familiar, thats because we recently wrote about their web dashboard for the ESP32. This is the same again but emphasizing the STM32 support this time around. We originally heard about the Mongoose technology line all the way back in 2017!\nThanks to [Toly] for letting us know about this new howto.\n", "title": "- STM32\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Cesanta Software\u304cSTM32\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u69cb\u7bc9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002OTA\u66f4\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u7279\u9577\u3002", "titles": ["- STM32\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "- OTA\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u66f4\u65b0", "- \u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304b\u3089\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u307e\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- Mongoose\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "- ESP32\u304b\u3089STM32\u3078\u3001\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

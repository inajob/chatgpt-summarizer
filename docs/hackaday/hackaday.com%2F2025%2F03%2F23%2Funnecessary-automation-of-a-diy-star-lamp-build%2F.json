When you\u2019re making one of these, maybe-just-maybe you\u2019d be willing to drill a thousand holes and fit a thousand little plastic rods, but by the time you\u2019re making a second, it\u2019s time to build a machine to do the work for you.\nSo maybe we quibble with the channel name \u201cUnnecessary Automation,\u201d but we won\u2019t quibble with the results. It\u2019s a machine that orients a sphere, drills the hole, inserts the plastic wire, glues it together with a UV-curing glue, and then trims the end off. And if you like crazy machines, it\u2019s a beauty.\nThe video goes through all of the design thoughts in detail, but it\u2019s when it comes time to build the machine that the extra-clever bits emerge. For instance, [UA] used a custom 3D-printed peristaltic pump to push the glue out. Taking the disadvantage of peristaltic pumps \u2013 that they pulse \u2013 as an advantage, a custom housing was designed that dispensed the right amount between the rollers. The rolling glue dispenser mechanism tips up and back to prevent drips.\nThere are tons of other project-specific hacks here, from the form on the inside of the sphere that simplifies optic bundling and routing to the clever use of a razor blade as a spring. Give it a watch if you find yourself designing your own wacky machines. We think Rube Goldberg would approve. Check out this video for a more software-orientated take on fiber-optic displays.\n\n\n"}

When you\u2019re making one of these, maybe-just-maybe you\u2019d be willing to drill a thousand holes and fit a thousand little plastic rods, but by the time you\u2019re making a second, it\u2019s time to build a machine to do the work for you.\nSo maybe we quibble with the channel name \u201cUnnecessary Automation,\u201d but we won\u2019t quibble with the results. It\u2019s a machine that orients a sphere, drills the hole, inserts the plastic wire, glues it together with a UV-curing glue, and then trims the end off. And if you like crazy machines, it\u2019s a beauty.\nThe video goes through all of the design thoughts in detail, but it\u2019s when it comes time to build the machine that the extra-clever bits emerge. For instance, [UA] used a custom 3D-printed peristaltic pump to push the glue out. Taking the disadvantage of peristaltic pumps \u2013 that they pulse \u2013 as an advantage, a custom housing was designed that dispensed the right amount between the rollers. The rolling glue dispenser mechanism tips up and back to prevent drips.\nThere are tons of other project-specific hacks here, from the form on the inside of the sphere that simplifies optic bundling and routing to the clever use of a razor blade as a spring. Give it a watch if you find yourself designing your own wacky machines. We think Rube Goldberg would approve. Check out this video for a more software-orientated take on fiber-optic displays.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u7403\u4f53\u306e\u661f\u7a7a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u7403\u4f53\u306e\u661f\u7a7a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u8a70\u307e\u3063\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u7403\u4f53\u306e\u661f\u7a7a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "- 1,000\u500b\u306e\u7a74\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u69cb\u9020", "- \u5c02\u75283D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u63a5\u7740\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u5149\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

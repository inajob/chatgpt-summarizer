If you were to spend a night camping out in the Alaskan winter, your first choice of shelter almost certainly wouldnt be a USPS electric cargo trike, but over on YouTube [Matt Spears] shows that its not that hard to make a lovely little camper out of the mail bike.\u00a0\nWere not sure how much use these sorts of cargo trikes get in Alaska, but [Matt] seems to have acquired this one surplus after an entirely-predictable crash took one of the mirrors off. A delta configuration trike  single wheel in front  is tippy at the best of times, but the high center of gravity youd get from a loading the rear with mail just makes it worse. That evidently did not deter the United States Postal Service, and it didnt deter [Matt] either.\nHis conversion is rather minimal: to turn the cargo compartment into a camper, he only adds a few lights, a latch on the inside of the rear door, and a wood-burning stove for heat. Rather than have heavy insulation shrink the already-small cargo compartment, [Matt] opts to insulate himself with a pile of warm sleeping bags. Some zip-tie tire chains even let him get the bike moving (slowly) in a winter storm that he claims got his truck stuck.\nWhile it might not be a practical winter vehicle, at least on un-plowed mountain roads, starting with an electric-assist cargo trike Uncle Sam already paid for represented a huge cost and time savings vs starting from scratch like this teardrop bike camper we featured a while back. While not as luxurious, it seems more practical for off-roading than another electric RV weve seen.\n\n"}

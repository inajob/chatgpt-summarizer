If you were to spend a night camping out in the Alaskan winter, your first choice of shelter almost certainly wouldnt be a USPS electric cargo trike, but over on YouTube [Matt Spears] shows that its not that hard to make a lovely little camper out of the mail bike.\u00a0\nWere not sure how much use these sorts of cargo trikes get in Alaska, but [Matt] seems to have acquired this one surplus after an entirely-predictable crash took one of the mirrors off. A delta configuration trike  single wheel in front  is tippy at the best of times, but the high center of gravity youd get from a loading the rear with mail just makes it worse. That evidently did not deter the United States Postal Service, and it didnt deter [Matt] either.\nHis conversion is rather minimal: to turn the cargo compartment into a camper, he only adds a few lights, a latch on the inside of the rear door, and a wood-burning stove for heat. Rather than have heavy insulation shrink the already-small cargo compartment, [Matt] opts to insulate himself with a pile of warm sleeping bags. Some zip-tie tire chains even let him get the bike moving (slowly) in a winter storm that he claims got his truck stuck.\nWhile it might not be a practical winter vehicle, at least on un-plowed mountain roads, starting with an electric-assist cargo trike Uncle Sam already paid for represented a huge cost and time savings vs starting from scratch like this teardrop bike camper we featured a while back. While not as luxurious, it seems more practical for off-roading than another electric RV weve seen.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30e9\u30b9\u30ab\u3067\u306e\u51ac\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01USPS\u96fb\u52d5\u8ca8\u7269\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u6539\u9020", "body": "\u30a2\u30e9\u30b9\u30ab\u306e\u51ac\u3001\u90f5\u4fbf\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u7c21\u6613\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3002 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30e9\u30b9\u30ab\u3067\u306e\u51ac\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01USPS\u96fb\u52d5\u8ca8\u7269\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u51ac\u7528\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\uff1a\u90f5\u4fbf\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u90f5\u4fbf\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u51ac\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u5316\uff1a\u8a2d\u5099\u3068\u5de5\u592b", "\u30a2\u30e9\u30b9\u30ab\u306e\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u51ac\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u96fb\u52d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u6539\u9020\uff01USPS\u96fb\u52d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u51ac\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ab\u30fc"]}

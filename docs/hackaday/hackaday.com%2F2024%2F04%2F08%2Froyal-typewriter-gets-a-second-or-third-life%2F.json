But [Make it Kozi] wanted an old-fashioned typewriter. The problem is, as he notes, they are nostalgically popular these days, so picking up a working model can be pricey. The answer? Buy a junker and restore it. You can watch the whole process in the video below, too, but nearly the only sound youll hear is the clacking of the keys. He doesnt say a word until around the 14-minute mark. Just warning you if you have it playing in the background!\nOf course, even if you can find a $10 typewriter, it probably wont be the same kind, nor will it have the same problems. However, it is a good bet that any old mechanical typewriter will need many of the same steps.\n\nThe first order of business was to clean everything up. He was afraid of breaking springs with a brush, so much of the cleaning was done with an air gun. Even then, some of the linkages were prone to sticking. The keys also needed some very deep cleaning.

We lose sleep every time we have to work on our old Selectric. They are pricey and, even for an electric typewriter, complicated. Of course, an electric has a lot more hacking opportunities.\n"}

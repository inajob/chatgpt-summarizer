Its a highly complex system that requires constant vigilance to a relatively boring task with high stakes, which is not something humans are particularly well adapted for. Modern GPS equipment can solve a few of these attention problems, with some able to at least show the current speed limit and perhaps an ongoing information feed of the current driving conditions., Trains, on the other hand, solved a lot of these problems long ago. [Philo] and [Tris], two train aficionados, were recently able to get an old speed indicator from a train and get it working in a similar way in their own car.\nThe speed indicator itself came from a train on the Red Line of the T, Bostons subway system run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Trains have a few unique ways of making sure they go the correct speed for whatever track theyre on as well as avoid colliding with other trains, and this speed indicator is part of that system. [Philo] and [Tris] found out through some reverse engineering that most of the parts were off-the-shelf components, and were able to repair a few things as well as eventually power everything up. With the help of an Arduino, an I/O expander, and some transistors to handle the 28V requirement for the speed indicator, the pair set off in their car to do some real-world testing.\nThis did take a few tries to get right, as there were some issues with the power supply as well as some bugs to work out in order to interface with the vehicles OBD-II port. They also tried to use GPS for approximating speed as well, and after a few runs around Boston they were successful in getting this speed indicator working as a speedometer for their car. Its an impressive bit of reverse engineering as well as interfacing newer technology with old. For some other bits of train technology reproduced in the modern world you might also want to look at this recreation of a train whistle.\n\n", "title": "\u8eca\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u793e\u4f1a\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u770b\u677f\u306e\u554f\u984c", "body": "\u8eca\u793e\u4f1a\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u6b20\u70b9\u306f\u3001\u904b\u8ee2\u624b\u304c\u8a8d\u8b58\u3057\u3001\u8aad\u307f\u3001\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u770b\u677f\u306e\u91cf\u304c\u81a8\u5927\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5217\u8eca\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u30012\u4eba\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306f\u5217\u8eca\u304b\u3089\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u901f\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\u5668\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3066\u8eca\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u8eca\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u793e\u4f1a\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u770b\u677f\u306e\u554f\u984c", "GPS\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30c8\u8868\u793a", "\u65b0\u65e7\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\uff1a\u8eca\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u96fb\u8eca\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u518d\u73fe", "\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u8eca\u7528\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc"]}

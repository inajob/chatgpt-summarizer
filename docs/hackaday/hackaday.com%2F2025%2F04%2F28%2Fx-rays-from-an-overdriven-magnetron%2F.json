Its technically incorrect, of course, as the magnetron inside the oven emits only non-ionizing radiation, and is completely incapable of generating ionizing radiation such as X-rays. Right?\nPerhaps not, as these experiments with an overdriven magnetron suggest. First off, this is really something you shouldnt try; aside from the obvious hazards that attend any attempt to generate ionizing radiation, there are risks aplenty here. First of all, modifying magnetrons as [SciTubeHD] did here is risky thanks to the toxic beryllium they contain, and the power supply he used, which features a DIY flyback transformer we recently featured, generates potentially dangerous voltages. Youve been warned.\nFor the experiment, [SciTubeHD] stripped the magnets off a magnetron and connected his 40-kV AC power supply between the filament and the metal case of the tube. Were not completely clear to us how this creates X-rays, but it appears to do so given the distinctive glow given off by an intensifying screen harvested from an old medical X-ray film cassette. The light is faint, but theres enough to see the shadows of metallic objects like keys and PCBs positioned between the tube and the intensifying screen.\nAre there any practical applications for this? Probably not, especially considering the potential risks. But its still pretty cool, and were suitably impressed that magnetrons can be repurposed like this.\n\n"}

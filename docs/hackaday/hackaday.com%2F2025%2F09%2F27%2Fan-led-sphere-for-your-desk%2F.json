If youre looking for similar vibes you can access at home, you might enjoy the desk toy that [AGBarber] has designed.\nThe scale is small  the sphere measures just 98 mm (3.6 inches) in diameter  but that just means its accessible enough to be fun. The build is based around various sizes of WS2812B addressable LED rings, and contains 120 individual RGB LEDs in total. Theyre wrapped up in a 3D printed housing which does a great job of diffusing the light. Transparent filament was used to print parts that light up with a richly-saturated glow with few visible hotspots. Commanding the LEDs is an ESP8266 microcontroller in the form of a Wemos D1 Mini, which provides plenty of grunt to run animations as well as great wireless connectivity options. [AGBarber] relied on their own Pixel Spork library to handle all the cool lighting effects. Files are on GitHub for the curious.\nMaybe you dont like spheres, and icosahedrons are more your speed. Well, weve featured those too\u2014with 2,400 LEDs, no less.\n\n"}

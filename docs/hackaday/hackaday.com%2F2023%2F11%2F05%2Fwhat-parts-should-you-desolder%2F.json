It was possible with a bit of work and searching to build all manner of electronic projects without spending much at all.\u00a0 Many hardware hackers know their way around consumer electronics from the decade before their teenage years as a result. Secondhand components can still be used, but the type of components to be found has changed, as well as those needed. [ElectricMonkeyBrain] takes a look, and asks What should you desolder?.\nAs a general rule, he lands on the premise that its worth hanging on to the expensive stuff rather than the cheap stuff. Large capacitors, power semiconductors, and inductors arent cheap at all, and in the case of the inductors they can yield both ferrite parts and enameled wire for rewinding to suit. Were surprised that he advocates holding on to electrolytic capacitors as a kit of many values is now pretty cheap, but its understandable that if you lack the part and its there on a motherboard in front of you, its worth desoldering. Finally, he discusses cases, something weve been tempted by a few times more than wed like to mention.\nIn a world of easy online ordering, its useful to be reminded that sometimes theres still space for salvaged parts, after all, no delivery service is as quick as reaching under your bench for an old ATX power supply to raid. As always though, dont amass too much of it.\n\n"}

You can be anything you put your mind to!  well, perhaps they are true on occasion. For instance when [rctestflight] had PCBs that dreamed of becoming a hydrofoil, he found a way to make that dream come true.\nIts kind of obvious in retrospect: printed circuit boards are made of FR4, which is a form of fiberglass, and you know what else is commonly made of fiberglass? Boats. So yes, the material is suited for this task. The fact that solder joints hold up to use in a little remote-control hydrofoil is less obvious, but good to know. It certainly makes for easier assembly for those of us who have developed an allergy to epoxy.\nEase of assembly wasnt really the point here: the point was that by making the mast of the hydrofoil out of PCB thats the part that holds the underwater wing [rctestflight] figured he could (shock!) print a circuit onto it. Specifically, a liquid-level sensor, and because microcontrollers are so cheap these days he went the total overkill route of embedding an ESP32 on each mast. He started with a resistive sensor, but since those self-corrode too quickly, the team switched to a capacitive sensor that doesnt need to form a galvanic cell in salt water. Come to think of it, that might still be a problem with the solder joint between the PCBs. Good thing nobody will be riding this one.\nHaving such a sensor and brain close-coupled allows for a faster control loop than the sonar [rctestflight] had previously been using to control his hydrofoils altitude.. Pivoting each mast with its own servo made for a smooth flight over the water well, once they got the PID tuning set, anyway. Check it out in the video embedded below.\nWeve seen PCB\u00a0used for enclosures before, and even the chassis of a rover, but using it for a hydrofoil is a new hack.\n"}

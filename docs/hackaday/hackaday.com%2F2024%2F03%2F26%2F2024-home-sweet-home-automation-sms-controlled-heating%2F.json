However, the heating system, a night-storage system, is not so practical. They needed a way to remotely control the unit so that the place was habitable after a long winter commute; lacking internet connectivity, they devised a sensible solution to create an SMS-controlled remote heating controller.\nThe controller runs atop an old Raspberry Pi B inside a 3D-printed case. Seeing such an old board given a real job to do is nice. Connectivity is via a USB UMTS stick which handles the SMS over the cellular network. The controller knob for the heater thermostat (not shown) is attached via a toothed belt to a pully and a 28BYJ-48 5V geared stepper motor. Temperature measurement is via the ubiquitous DS1820 module which hooks straight up to the I2C bus on the Pi with no fuss.\nThe software is built on top of Gammu, which handles the interface to the UMTS device. Daily and historical temperature ranges are sent via SMS so [mabe42] can decide how to configure the heating before their arrival. The rest of the software stack is in Python, as per this (German-language) GitHub project.\nWhile we were thinking about storage heating systems (and how much of a pain they are), we came across this demonstration of how to build one yourself.\n \n\n", "title": "\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6696\u623f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "body": "Hackaday.io\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b[mabe42]\u306f\u3001\u9031\u306e\u9593\u306f\u5730\u5143\u304b\u3089\u96e2\u308c\u305f\u5834\u6240\u3067\u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u5730\u3067\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u501f\u308a\u3066\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6696\u623f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u3067\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9060\u65b9\u304b\u3089\u5e30\u5b85\u5f8c\u306e\u5ba4\u5185\u3092\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001SMS\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9060\u9694\u6696\u623f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6696\u623f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "SMS\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u6696\u623f\u3092DIY\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u6696\u623f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u4e0d\u8981\uff01SMS\u3067\u6696\u623f\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u643a\u5e2f\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6696\u623f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

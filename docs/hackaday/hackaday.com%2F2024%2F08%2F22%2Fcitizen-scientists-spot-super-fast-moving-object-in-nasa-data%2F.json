You probably havent seen anything that fast snice. According to NASA, though, a group of citizen scientists spotted a celestial object doing just that!\nThe group of citizen scientists were involved in a NASA program called Backyard Worlds: Planet 9. They were working on images from NASAs Wide-field Infrared Explorer mission. Scanning through stored images, Martin Kabatnik, Thomas P. Bickle, and Dan Caselden identified a curiously speedy object termed CWISE J124909.08+362116.0. There are lots of fast-moving objects out in space, but few quite as fast as this one. Its quite literally zooming through the Milky Way at about 1 million miles per hour.\nIts unclear exactly what the object is. It appears light enough to be a low-mass star, or potentially a brown dwarf\u2014somewhere in between the classification of gas giant and star. It also has suspiciously low iron and metallic content. The leading hypothesis is that CWISE J1249 might have been ejected from a supernova, or that it got flung around a pair of black holes.\nFor now, it remains a mystery. Its a grand discovery that really highlights the value of citizen science. If youve been doing your own rigorous scientific work\u2014on NASAs data or your own\u2014do let us know!"}

The code requires a fair amount of training to use effectively, though, and even proficient radio operators tend to send only around 20 words per minute. As a result of the reduced throughput, a type of language evolved around Morse code which, like any language, has evolved and changed over time. QRP initially meant something akin to you are overloading my receiver, please reduce transmitter power but now means operating radios at extremely low power levels. [MIKROWAVE1] explores some of the earlier options for QRP radios in this video.\nTheres been some debate in the amateur radio community over the years over what power level constitutes a QRP operation, but its almost certainly somewhere below 100 watts, and while the radios in this video have varying power levels, they tend to be far below this upper threshold, with some operating on 1 watt or less. There are a few commercial offerings demonstrated here, produced from the 70s to the mid-80s, but a few are made from kits as well. Kits tended to be both accessible and easily repairable, with Heathkit being the more recognizable option among this category. To operate Morse code (or continuous wave as hams would call it) only requires a single transistor which is why kits were so popular, but there are a few other examples in this video with quite a few more transistors than that. In fact, there are all kinds of radios featured here with plenty of features we might even consider modern by todays standards; at least when Morse code is concerned.\nQRP radios in general are attractive because they tend to be smaller, simpler, and more affordable. Making QRP contacts over great distances also increases ones ham radio street cred, especially when using Morse, although this benefit is more intangible. Theres a large trend going on in the radio world right now surrounding operating from parks and mountain peaks, which means QRP is often the only way to get that done especially when operating on battery power. Modern QRP radios often support digital and voice modes as well and can have surprisingly high prices, but taking some cues from this video about radios built in decades past could get you on the radio for a minimum or parts and cost, provided you can put in the time.\n\n", "title": "\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u304c\u6700\u9069\u3060", "body": "\u6975\u7aef\u306b\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u304c\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u72b6\u6cc1\u4e0b\u3067\u306e\u6700\u826f\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u624b\u6bb5\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u7b26\u53f7\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001QRP\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u4f4e\u51fa\u529b\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u542b\u3081\u3001\u4ee5\u524d\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u4fee\u7406\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u89b3\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u5834\u5408\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002QRP\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u3001\u5927\u304d\u3055\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u3088\u308a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u6642\u306b\u306f\u901a\u5e38\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3068\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u304c\u6700\u9069\u3060", "QRP\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u9032\u5316", "QRP\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u624b\u9803\u3067\u3042\u308b", "\u500b\u4eba\u88fd\u4f5c\u306eQRP\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

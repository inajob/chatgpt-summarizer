The saxophone is an altogether more beguiling instrument that makes for one hell of an interface, but theres a problem: theyre seldom MIDI-compatible. This build from [AndrewChi] changes all that.\nThis digitized sax relies on a SparkFun ESP32 Thing as the brains of the operation. It uses Hall effect sensors, the digital switch type, to detect the action of the keys of the sax. Choosing parts that are quick to respond is key for musical use, so [AndrewChi] selected the Texas Instruments DRV5023 for its unipolar operation, short output delay and fast rise time. Beyond setting up the basic keys to send MIDI notes, the instrument also received additional octave controls for greater range. With sensors and magnets attached to the saxophone and keys with Sugru, the instrument is ready to serve as a capable MIDI controller. Thanks to the ESP32, its capable of sending MIDI data wirelessly over Bluetooth for the maximum freedom of performance.\nIts a nifty build, and a great way for wind players to get into the world of controlling digital synthesizers in an intuitive fashion. Weve seen some great MIDI controller builds before, too.\n\n"}

This year, the same group is back with tales of success, lawsuits, and appearances in the Polish Parliament. Youre not going to believe this, but its hilarious.\nThe short version of the story is that [Mr. Tick], [q3k], and [Redford] became minor stars in Poland, have caused criminal investigations to begin against the train company, and even made the front page of the New York Times. Newag, the train manufacturer in question has opened several lawsuits against them. The lawsuit alleges the team is infringing on a Newag copyright  by publishing the code that locked the trains, no less! If thats not enough, Newag goes on to claim that the white hat hackers are defaming the company.\nWhat we found fantastically refreshing was how the three take all of this in stride, as the ridiculous but incredibly inconvenient consequences of daring to tell the truth. Along the way theyve used their platform to speak out for open-sourcing publicly funded code, and the right to repair  not just for consumers but also for large rail companies. They are truly fighting the good fight here, and its inspirational to see that theyre doing so with humor and dignity.\nIf you missed their initial, more technical, talk last year, go check it out. And if you ever find yourself in their shoes, dont be afraid to do the right thing. Just get a good lawyer."}

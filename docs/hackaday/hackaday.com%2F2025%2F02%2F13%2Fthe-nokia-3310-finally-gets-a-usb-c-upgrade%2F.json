Its also woefully out of date and only usable in a handful of countries that still maintain a GSM network. It might not be easy to bring it into the 5G era, but you can at least convert it to work with modern chargers, thanks to [Andrea].\n[SGCDerek] whipped up their own solution for USB-C charging.If you dont want to buy the parts, you can just DIY the same mod. [SGCDerek] did just that a few years ago. From what it looks like, you likely dont even need to worry about doing any fancy charger handshaking. The 3310 will happily grab a charge from a low-current 5V supply straight off the USB pins.\nYou might think this is a messy, complicated mod, but [Andrea] engineered it as a drop-in upgrade. Hes combined a USB-C port with a small plastic adapter that enables it to sit in place of the original phones charge port module.\u00a0 Contact between the port and the rest of the phone is via spring-loaded contacts. The only additional step necessary is popping out the mic from the original charge module and putting it in the new one. You need only a screw driver to disassemble the phone, swap out the parts, and put it all back together.\nIf you want to upgrade your own handset, [Andrea] is more than happy to provide the parts for a reasonable price of 25 euros. Its almost worth it just for the laughs\u2014head around to your friends house, ask to borrow a charger, and then plug in your USB-C 3310. Youll blow some minds.\nOnce upon a time, it was big news that someone hacked a USB-C port into the iPhone. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3092USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u306bUSB-C\u5145\u96fb\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3092USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3055\u305b\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u7c21\u5358\uff01\u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3078\u306eUSB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u8ffd\u52a0\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb", "- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a23310\u3092\u751f\u304d\u8fd4\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

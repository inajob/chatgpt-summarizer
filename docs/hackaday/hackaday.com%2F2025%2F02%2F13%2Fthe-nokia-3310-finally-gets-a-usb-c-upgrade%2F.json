Its also woefully out of date and only usable in a handful of countries that still maintain a GSM network. It might not be easy to bring it into the 5G era, but you can at least convert it to work with modern chargers, thanks to [Andrea].\n[SGCDerek] whipped up their own solution for USB-C charging.If you dont want to buy the parts, you can just DIY the same mod. [SGCDerek] did just that a few years ago. From what it looks like, you likely dont even need to worry about doing any fancy charger handshaking. The 3310 will happily grab a charge from a low-current 5V supply straight off the USB pins.\nYou might think this is a messy, complicated mod, but [Andrea] engineered it as a drop-in upgrade. Hes combined a USB-C port with a small plastic adapter that enables it to sit in place of the original phones charge port module.\u00a0 Contact between the port and the rest of the phone is via spring-loaded contacts. The only additional step necessary is popping out the mic from the original charge module and putting it in the new one. You need only a screw driver to disassemble the phone, swap out the parts, and put it all back together.\nIf you want to upgrade your own handset, [Andrea] is more than happy to provide the parts for a reasonable price of 25 euros. Its almost worth it just for the laughs\u2014head around to your friends house, ask to borrow a charger, and then plug in your USB-C 3310. Youll blow some minds.\nOnce upon a time, it was big news that someone hacked a USB-C port into the iPhone. Video after the break.\n\n"}

But thats just the hardware! It also comes with gigabytes upon gigabytes of Wikipedia, Wikihow, TED talks, and other information/entertainment, for the less eventful days in the wastelands.\nIf you, too, would like to have one, fret not! The parts list and design files are public, even though some assembly is required."}

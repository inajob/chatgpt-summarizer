Yet what about a humble Casio F91W that can be bought for about $15 if its the genuine article and not one of the millions of fakes? Over at the\u00a0Watches of Espionage site they figured that theyd dress up one of these famous watches to give it the best possible shot at surviving the crushing pressures at a depth of 5 km.\nThe actual modification to the F91W was pretty mild, involving nothing but a hydro-mod whereby oil is used to replace the air inside the watch case. Since oil is incompressible, nothing bad should happen to the watch. Theoretically at least. The Watch-Under-Test (WUT) was strapped to a US Navys CURV 21 remotely operated vehicle and dunked into the ocean before starting its descend into the inky darkness of the deep sea.\nAlthough only hitting a measly 4,950 km, the watch survived just fine, showing that even if youre a secret US operative on a deep-dive espionage mission, all you really need is one of these Casio watches."}

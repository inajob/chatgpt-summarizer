Today, you are probably just reaching for a calculator, or if you are writing a program, youll probably just guess and iterate. [MindYourDecisions] was curious how people did square roots before they had such aids. Dont remember? Never learned? Watch the video below and learn a new skill.\nThe process is straightforward, but if you are a product of a traditional math education, you might find his terminology a bit confusing. He will refer to something like 18b meaning a three-digit number where the last digit is b, not 18 times b, as you might expect.\n\nIf you think the first few examples are a little convenient, dont worry. The video gets harder as you go along. By the end, youll be working with numbers that have fractional parts and whose square roots are not integers.\nSpeaking of the last part, stay tuned for the end, where youll learn the origin of the algorithm and why it works. Oddly, its origin is a Sanskrit poem. Who knew? He also talks about other ways the ancients computed square roots. As for us, well stick with our slide rule.\n"}

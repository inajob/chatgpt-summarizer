That seems to be the big idea behind the lovely little HexaClock from [Bulduper]. And boy, is it both.\nProbably the most important part of this well-illuminated clock is the light sensor, which allows it to adjust the brightness automatically. If youre not into that, well, theres a really nice web app thatll let you program the dickens out of it.\nThe brains of this thing is an ESP8266 on a custom PCB which controls the 127 individually addressable RGB LEDs. The clock may look large, but the big printed parts just fit on the bed of a Prusa i3. [Bulduper] used ABS because the LED strip and the PCB might get a little warm; they didnt want to risk using PLA and having it turn into a Salvador Dali clock (although that could be cool).\nSpeaking of heat, make sure to use 18 AWG or thicker wires as [Bulduper] advises. LEDs may be efficient, but this clock uses lots of them! If you want to build one of these to bathe your wall in useful light, everything you need is available on GitHub. Watch HexaClock do its thing in the brief demo and walk-through video after the break.\nIf this is a little too bright for your tastes, check out this synesthesia clock.\n\n", "title": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED\u6642\u8a08HexaClock\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "HexaClock\u306f\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u3066\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u3002\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u660e\u308b\u3055\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3057\u3001ESP8266\u3067RGB LED\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4e01\u5be7\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u3067\u3001GitHub\u3067\u5168\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED\u6642\u8a08HexaClock\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "ESP8266\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u8abf\u5149\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "127\u500b\u306eRGB LED\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308bHexaClock\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u58c1\u639b\u3051\u6642\u8a08HexaClock\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308bHexaClock\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u60c5\u5831"]}

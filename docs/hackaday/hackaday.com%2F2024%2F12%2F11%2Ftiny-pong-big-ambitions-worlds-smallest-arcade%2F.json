Standing just 64 mm tall, 26 mm wide, and 30 mm deep, this machine is a scaled-down marvel playing the classic Atari game PONG. While the record isn\u2019t yet official\u2014it takes about three months for Guinness to certify\u2014it\u2019s clear [Korhonen]\u2019s creation embodies ingenuity and dedication.\n[Korhonen], an electromechanical engineering student, took six months to design and build this micro arcade. Inspired by records within reach, she aimed to outdo the previous tiniest arcade machine by shaving off just a few millimeters During the project she faced repeated failures, but viewed each iteration as a step towards success. Her miniature machine isn\u2019t just a gimmick; it\u2019s fully functional, with every component\u2014from paddle mechanics to coding\u2014developed from scratch.\n[Korhonen] is already eyeing new projects, including creating the smallest humanoid robot. She also plans to integrate her electromechanical expertise into her family\u2019s escape room business. Her journey aligns with other hobbyist projects pushing the limits of miniaturization, such as this\u00a0credit card-sized Tetris clone or [Aliaksei Zholner]\u2019s paper micro engines.", "title": "- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u306e\u5b66\u751f\u304c\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u306e\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u3080\u3001\u30d3\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30db\u30cd\u30f3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5b8c\u5168\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u306ePONG\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "- \u5931\u6557\u3092\u7ce7\u306b\u6210\u9577\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "- \u6b21\u306a\u308b\u76ee\u6a19\u306f\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\uff01"]}

Theyre a fun novelty for the two or three days theyre expected to be worn, but after that, they end up getting tossed in a drawer (or worse.) As you might imagine, this can be a somewhat depressing thought thought for the folks who design and build these badges.\nBut thanks to a new firmware released by the FREE-WILi project, at least one badge is going to get a shot at having a second life. When loaded onto the RP2350-powered DEF CON 32 badge, the device is turned into a handy hardware hacking multi-tool. By navigating through a graphical interface, users will be able to control the badges GPIO pins, communicate over I2C, receive and transmit via infrared, and more. Were particularly interested in the projects claims that the combination of their firmware and the DC32 badge create an ideal platform for testing and debugging Simple Add-Ons (SAOs).\n\nDont know what the FREE-WILi project is? Neither did we until today, which is actually kind of surprising now that were getting a good look at it. Basically, its a handheld gadget with a dozen programmable GPIO pins and a pair of CC1101 sub-GHz radios thats designed to talk towhatever you could possibly want to interface with.\nIts a bit like an even more capable Bus Pirate 5, which considering how many tricks that particular device can pull off, is saying something. As an added bonus, apparently you can even wear the FREE-WILi on your wrist for mobile hardware hacking action!\nAnyway, while the hardware in the FREE-WILi is clearly more capable than whats under the hood of the DC32 badge, theres enough commonality between them that the developers were able to port a few of the key features over. Its a clever idea  theres something like 30,000 of these badges out there in the hands of nerds all over the world, and by installing this firmware, theyll get a taste of what the project is capable of and potentially spring for the full kit.\nIf you give your DC32 badge the FREE-WILi treatment, be sure to let us know in the comments.", "title": "- DEF CON 32\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u7121\u6599\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7528\u9014\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u3002FREE-WILi\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3002", "titles": ["- DEF CON 32\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u7121\u6599\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u7121\u99c4\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- FREE-WILi\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308bGPIO\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\uff01DC32\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u8155\u6642\u8a08\u578b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u5275\u9020\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

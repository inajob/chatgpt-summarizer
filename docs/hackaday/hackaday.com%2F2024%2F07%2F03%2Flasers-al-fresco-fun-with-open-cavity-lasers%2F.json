But to make things even clearer, you might want to take a step inside the laser with something like [Les Wright]s open-cavity He-Ne laser.\nIn most gas lasers, the stimulated emission action takes place within a closed optical cavity, typically formed by a glass tube whose ends are sealed with mirrors, one of which is partially silvered. The gas in the tube is stimulated, by an electrical discharge in the case of a helium-neon laser, and the stimulated photons bounce back and forth between the mirrors until some finally blast out through the partial mirror to form a coherent, monochromatic laser beam. By contrast, an open-cavity laser has a gas-discharge tube sealed with the fully silvered mirror on one end and a Brewster window on the other, which is a very flat piece of glass set at a steep angle to the long axis of the tube and transparent to p-polarized light. A second mirror is positioned opposite the Brewster window and aligned to create a resonant optical cavity external to the tube.\nTo switch mirrors easily, [Les] crafted a rotating turret mount for six different mirrors. The turret fits in a standard optical bench mirror mount, which lets him precisely align the mirror in two dimensions. He also built a quick alignment jig, as well as a safety enclosure to protect the delicate laser tube. The tube is connected to a high-voltage supply and after a little tweaking the open cavity starts to lase. [Les] could extend the cavity to almost half a meter, although even a waft of smoke was enough obstruction to kill the lasing at that length.\nIf this open-cavity laser arrangement seems familiar, it might be because [Les] previously looked at an old-school particle counter with such a laser at its heart.\n", "title": "\u958b\u653e\u578b\u30d8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0-\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "\u30d8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0-\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u7ba1\u5185\u3067\u52b1\u8d77\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5149\u5b50\u304c\u90e8\u5206\u93e1\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u51fa\u529b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u5185\u90e8\u3067\u8907\u96d1\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u793a\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306b[Les Wright]\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u958b\u3044\u305f\u8154\u5185\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3002\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u516d\u3064\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u93e1\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30bf\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u4f9b\u7d66\u5668\u3067\u767a\u632f\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u958b\u653e\u578b\u30d8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0-\u30cd\u30aa\u30f3\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u5149\u5b66\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3\u5185\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30bf\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30d6\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5171\u9cf4\u5149\u5b66\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u4f9b\u7d66\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc"]}

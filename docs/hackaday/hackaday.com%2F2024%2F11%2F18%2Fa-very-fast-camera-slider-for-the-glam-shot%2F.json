To get similar visual effects on a much lower budget [Henry Kidman] built a large, very fast camera slider. As is usually the case with such projects, its harder than it seems.\nThe original GlamBOT has a full 6 degrees of freedom, but many of the shots its famous for are just a slightly curved path between two points. That curve adds a few zeros to the required budget, so a straight slider was deemed good enough for [Henry]s purposes. The first remaining challenge is speed. V1 one used linear rails made from shower curtain rails, with 3D printed sliders driven by a large stepper motor via a belt. The stepper motor wasnt powerful enough to achieve the desired acceleration, so [Henry] upgraded to a more powerful 6 hp servo motor.\nUnfortunately, the MDF and 3D-printed frame components were not rigid enough for the upgraded torque. It caused several crashes into the ends of the frame as the belt slipped and failed to stop the camera platform. The frame was rebuilt from steel, with square tubing for the rails and steel plates for the brackets. It provided the required rigidity, but the welding had warped the rails which led to a bumpy ride for the camera so he had to use active stabilization on the gimbal and camera.\u00a0This project was filled with setback and challenges, but in the end the results look very promising with great slow motion shots on a mock red carpet.\nWeve seen DIY camera sliders of all shapes and sizes, including ones made from\u00a0skateboard trucks and wood, and even a measuring tape.\n\n"}

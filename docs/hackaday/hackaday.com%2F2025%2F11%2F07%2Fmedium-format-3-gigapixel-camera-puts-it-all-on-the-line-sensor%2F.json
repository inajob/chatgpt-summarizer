Of course everyone who isnt a photographer knows that moar megapixles is moar better. So, when [Gigawipf], aka [Yannick Richter] wanted to make a camera, he knew he had to go big or go home. So big he went: a medium format camera with a whopping 3.2 gigapixel resolution.\nNow, getting a hold of a sensor like that is not easy, and [Yannick] didnt even try. The hack starts by tearing down a couple of recent-model Kodak scanners from eBay to get at those sweet CCD line sensors. Yes, this is that classic hack: the scanner camera. Then its off to the oscilloscope and the datasheet for some serious reverse-engineering to figure out how to talk to these things. Protocol analysis starts about 4 minutes in of the embedded video, and is worth watching even if you have no interest in photography.\nAs for what the line sensor will be talking to, why, its nothing other than a Rasberry Pi 5, interfacing through a custom PCB that also holds the stepper driver. Remember this is a line sensor camera: the sensor needs to be scanned across the image plane inside the camera, line by line, just as it is in the scanner. Hes using off-the-shelf linear rails to do that job. Technically we suppose you could use a mirror to optically scan the image across a fixed sensor, but scanner cameras have traditionally done it this way and [Yannick] is keeping with tradition. Why not? It works.\nSince these images are going to be huge\u00a0an SD card in the Pi doesnt cut it, so this is perhaps the only camera out there with an NVMe SSD. The raw data would be 19 GB per image, and though hes post-processing on the fly to PNG theyre still big pictures.\u00a0 There probably arent too many cameras sporting 8 touchscreens out there, either, but since the back of the thing is so large, why not? Theres still a CSI camera inside, too, but in this case its being used as a digital viewfinder. (Most of us would have made that the camera.) The scanner cam is, of course, far too slow to generate its own previews. The preview camera actually goes onto the same 3D-printed mount as the line sensor, putting it onto the same focal plane as the sensor. Yes, the real-time previews are used to focus the camera.\nIn many ways, this is the nicest scanner camera weve ever featured, but thats perhaps to be expected: there have been a lot of innovations to facilitate this build since scanner cams were common. Even the 3D printed and aluminum case is professional looking. Of course a big sensor needs a big lens, and after deciding projector lenses werent going to cut it, [Yannick] sprung for Pantax 67 system lenses, which are made for medium format cameras like this one. Well, not exactly like this one these lenses were first made for film cameras in the 60s. Still, they offer a huge image, high-quality optics, and manual focus and aperture controls in a format that was easy to 3D-print a mount for.\nIs it the most practical camera? Maybe not. Is it an impressive hack? Yes. Weve always had a soft-spot for scanner cameras, and a in a recent double-ccd camera hack, we were lamenting in the comments that nobody was doing it anymore. So were very grateful to [Manawyrm] for sending in the tip.\n\n"}

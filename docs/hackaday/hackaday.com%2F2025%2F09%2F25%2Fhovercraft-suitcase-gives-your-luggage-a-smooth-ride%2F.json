After the destruction of the wheel mount on her DIY suitcase, [Laura Kampf] wondered if it would be better to dispense with wheels altogether.\nTo give her suitcase a lift, [Kampf] decided to turn it into a hovercraft so it couldnt be stopped by pavement or puddles. The first task was finding an appropriate fan, and a compact leaf blower donated its body to makerdom for the project. After reducing the blower to its constituent components and finding a secret turbo switch, work began on the momentum curtain.\nNose-holing the arrangement and size of the holes to pipe air through the stapled tarp and tape skirt seemed to be the bulk of the trial-and-error in this one. Based on other hovercraft designs [Kampf] found, keeping the holes near the center of the inflated portion gave better lift. In the end, the carry-on is able to lift a decent amount even on its lowest setting, resulting in a suitcase that is not embarrassing for travel. No word yet on what TSA thinks.\nIf youre looking for another unexpected lift off, how about a full-sized flying Delorean replica? Weve also covered some of the reasons why we dont see more of these all terrain wonders.\n\n"}

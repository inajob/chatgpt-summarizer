After the destruction of the wheel mount on her DIY suitcase, [Laura Kampf] wondered if it would be better to dispense with wheels altogether.\nTo give her suitcase a lift, [Kampf] decided to turn it into a hovercraft so it couldnt be stopped by pavement or puddles. The first task was finding an appropriate fan, and a compact leaf blower donated its body to makerdom for the project. After reducing the blower to its constituent components and finding a secret turbo switch, work began on the momentum curtain.\nNose-holing the arrangement and size of the holes to pipe air through the stapled tarp and tape skirt seemed to be the bulk of the trial-and-error in this one. Based on other hovercraft designs [Kampf] found, keeping the holes near the center of the inflated portion gave better lift. In the end, the carry-on is able to lift a decent amount even on its lowest setting, resulting in a suitcase that is not embarrassing for travel. No word yet on what TSA thinks.\nIf youre looking for another unexpected lift off, how about a full-sized flying Delorean replica? Weve also covered some of the reasons why we dont see more of these all terrain wonders.\n\n", "title": "- \u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092 hovercraft \u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u8eca\u8f2a\u3092\u5ec3\u6b62\u3057\u3001\u30db\u30d0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6210\u529f\u3057\u3001\u65c5\u884c\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092 hovercraft \u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d6e\u904a\u3055\u305b\u308b", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30d6\u30ed\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30db\u30d0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u6d6e\u904a\u30b9\u30fc\u30c4\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- TSA\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3001\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u65c5\u7acb\u3061"]}

It\u2019s a solid reminder of what human ingenuity can achieve when you put a team of engineers, scientists, and astronauts together. While the ISS is no longer a new toy in space, for hackers and tinkerers, it\u2019s still one of the coolest and most ambitious projects ever. And if you\u2019re like us\u2014always looking for fresh inspiration\u2014you\u2019ll want to check this one out.\nThe ISS is a masterpiece, built piece by piece in space, because why make things easy? With 16 pressurized modules, it\u2019s got everything needed to keep humans alive and working in one of the harshest environments imaginable. Add in the $150 billion price tag (yes, billion), and it\u2019s officially the most expensive thing humans have ever built. What makes it especially interesting to us hackers is its life support systems\u2014recycling water, generating oxygen, and running on solar power. That\u2019s the kind of closed-loop system we love to experiment with down here on Earth. Imagine the implications for long-term sustainability!\nBut its not just a survival bunker in space. It\u2019s also a global science lab. The ISS gives researchers the chance to run experiments that could never happen under Earth\u2019s gravity\u2014everything from technology advancements to health experiments. Plus, it\u2019s our testing ground for future missions to Mars. If youre fascinated by the idea of hacking complex systems, or just appreciate a good build, the ISS is a dream project.\nCatch the documentary and dive into the world of space-grade hacking. The ISS may be orbiting out of sight, but for those of us looking to push the boundaries of whats possible, it\u2019s still full of inspiration.\n\n", "title": "\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08ISS\uff09\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u5922", "body": "National Geographic\u304cISS\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u77e5\u6075\u306e\u7d50\u6676\u3067\u3001\u751f\u547d\u7dad\u6301\u3084\u7814\u7a76\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002ISS\u306f$150 billion\u30c9\u30eb\u304b\u3051\u3066\u5efa\u8a2d\u3055\u308c\u3001\u592a\u967d\u5149\u3067\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u706b\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8a66\u9a13\u5834\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08ISS\uff09\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u5922", "ISS\uff1a\u4eba\u985e\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u3082\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u5efa\u9020\u7269", "ISS\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u4efb\u52d9\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u5834", "ISS\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u5916\u306e\u751f\u547d\u7dad\u6301\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "ISS\uff1a\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u306a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u62e0\u70b9"]}

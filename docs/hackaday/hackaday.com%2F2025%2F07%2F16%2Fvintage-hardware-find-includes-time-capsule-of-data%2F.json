By modern standards these text-only environments would have been extremely limited, with only weather updates, stock information, limited news, some email and messaging, and perhaps some classifieds or other miscellaneous information. This was an important time for the early Internet though, and [Nicola] recently discovered a time capsule of sorts from this era.\nHe first got a tip about a piece of vintage hardware, a DEC VAXstation II which was missing from his collection. But after painstakingly preserving the data on the hard drive he found it had been hosting one of these BBS servers and had plenty of gems from the era to show off. Not only does this build restore the DEC hardware but [Nicola] was able to virtualize the server using the data he recovered on a SIMH emulator, granting insights into how the Internet of this era was used.\n[Nicola] also brought the BBS messaging system back online, although he notes that running it on the original hardware wouldnt be feasible so for now it runs in the cloud. Its a fascinating look into the Internet of the past, far beyond when many of us first went online as well. For a deep dive on how these systems worked, as well as an introduction to some of the Internet culture of the day, we saw this guide to the BBS a little while ago.", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aDEC VAXstation II\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u3068BBS\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u751f", "body": "\u904e\u53bb\u306eBBS\u304c\u5fa9\u5143\u3055\u308c\u3001\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u6587\u5316\u304c\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aDEC VAXstation II\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u3068BBS\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u751f", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u521d\u671f\u306eBBS\u6587\u5316\u3092\u6398\u308a\u8d77\u3053\u3059", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u767a\u898b", "- \u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u4e0a\u3067\u8607\u3063\u305fBBS\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- SIMH\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u6614\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u4f53\u9a13\u306e\u518d\u73fe"]}

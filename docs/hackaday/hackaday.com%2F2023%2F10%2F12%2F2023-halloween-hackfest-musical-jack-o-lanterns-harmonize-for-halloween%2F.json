For some, its a chance to dress up and let loose. For others, its a chance to give everyone in the neighborhood a jump scare. For [Aaron], its the perfect time to put on a show in the yard with some musical, light-up jack-o-lanterns.\n[Aaron] came across some deeply-discounted light-up jack-o-lanterns a few years ago. They all had one of those Try Me buttons thats powered by a couple of coin cells and uses a temporary two-wire connection to the PCB, and [Aaron] figured he could remotely control them using this port of sorts.\nNow the guts are made of addressable RGB LEDs that are connected through the battery compartment via weatherproofed pigtails.\nOn the control side, he has a Raspberry Pi 3, an amplifier, and a couple of power supplies all housed in a weatherproof box. Since its not possible to multiplex both the lights and the audio on a Pi 3, he added a USB sound card into the mix.\nBe sure to check out the awesome demo video after the break, followed by a pumpkin conversion video.\nIf youre more into scaring people, carve up an animated evil-eye pumpkin.\n\n\n\n \n\n"}

Usually this involves some kind of token representation of the media, but heres [Bas] with a different twist (Dutch language, Google Translate link). Hes using the CDs themselves in their cases, identifying them by their barcodes.\nAt its heart is a Raspberry Pi Pico W and a barcode scanner  after reading the barcode, the Pi calls Discogs to find the tracks, and then uses the Spotify API to find the appropriate links. From there, Home Assistant forwards them along to a smart speaker for playback. As a nice touch, [Bas] designed a 3D printed holder for the electronics which makes the whole thing a bit neater to use.\nWe this approach for its relative simplicity, and because the real CDs ad the retro touch its a real winner. You can find all the resources in a GitHub repository, should you wish to make your own. Meanwhile, its certainly not the first barcode scanner weve seen."}

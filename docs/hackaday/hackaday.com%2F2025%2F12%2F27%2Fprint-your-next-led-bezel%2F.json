Sure, theyre inexpensive to purchase and not exactly uncommon. But we all know that when working on a project, one doesnt always have everything one might need right at hand. At times like that, 3D printing is like a superpower.\nPrinting a part you find yourself short of can be a lifesaver.\n[firstgizmo]s design is made with 3D printing in mind, and most printers should be able to handle making them. Need something a little different? Youre in luck because the STEP files are provided (something we love to see), which means modifications are just a matter of opening them in your favorite CAD program.\nTheres not even any need to export to an STL after making tweaks, because STEP support in slicer programs is now quite common, ever since PrusaSlicer opened that door a few years ago.\nNot using 5 mm LEDs, and need some other size? No problem, [firstgizmo] also has 3 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm versions so that its easy to mount those LEDs on a panel. Combined with a tool that turns SVG files into multi-color 3D models, one can even make some panels complete with color and lettering to go with those LEDs. That might be just whats needed to bring that midnight project to the next level.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067LED\u30d9\u30bc\u30eb\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "body": "LED\u30d9\u30bc\u30eb\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3001\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3082\u5bb9\u6613\u3067\u3059\u3002\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067LED\u30d9\u30bc\u30eb\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u30643D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306eLED\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc", "STEP\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u90e8\u54c1", "\u591a\u8272LED\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306eLED\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

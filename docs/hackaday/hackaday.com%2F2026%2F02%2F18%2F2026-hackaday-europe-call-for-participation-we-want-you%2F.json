But wait! This year theres a twist, or rather two. What absolutely hasnt changed, though, is that wed love to see you there, and wed love to hear about what youve been up to, so get your talk or workshop proposal in before March 18th.\nNew Place, New Time\nHackaday Europe is moving in all four dimensions! Well be meeting up in the absolutely lovely Lecco, Italy  just about equidistant from Milan and Bergamot, and taking place May 16th and 17th, with the traditional pre-event meetup on the night of the 15th for those who are already in town. The location is the Politecnico Milano campus, a hub of engineering nestled in the mountains.\nWho is going to be speaking at Hackaday Europe? You could be! We\u2019re opening up the Call for Participation right now, both for talks and for workshops. Whether you\u2019ve presented your work live before or not, you\u2019re not likely to find a more appreciative audience for epic hacks, creative constructions, or you own tales of hardware, firmware, or software derring-do.\nWorkshop space is limited, but if you want to teach a group of ten or so people your favorite techniques, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nAll presenters get in free, of course, so firm up what you\u2019d like to share, and get your proposal submitted ASAP.\nThe Badge\nWell be bringing the 2025 Hackaday Supercon Communicator Badge with us to Europe, so this is also your chance to get your hands on the retro-styled super sexy keyboard, LoRa module, and fantastically oblong screen. At Supercon, we ran our own custom mesh network, and it worked flawlessly, even on microwatts. Well be continuing the experiment in Italy, on different frequencies of course, but maybe pushing some of the transmission parameters to see how far we can go.\nThe user side of the badge is very accessible as well, being programmed in Micropython and supported with a sweet plug-in architecture that makes adding your own apps a breeze, or at least reasonably straightforward. And when Hackaday Europe comes to a close, you can simply reflash the badge with new firmware, and youve got the sweetest Meshtastic device out there.\nAnd it wouldnt be a Hackaday badge if it werent meant to be modified.\nThe People\nThe real reason to come to Hackaday Europe, though, is the other folks who come to Hackaday Europe. Youve never seen a more interested group of hardware hackers, and thats coincidentally also why youd like to give a presentation. You get to tell everyone what youre up to  its the ultimate ice-breaker.\nAt the risk of saying it again: Get your proposal in before March 18th, and we look forward to seeing you on the shore of Lake Como. (Info on tickets and more pre-conference hype coming soon.)"}

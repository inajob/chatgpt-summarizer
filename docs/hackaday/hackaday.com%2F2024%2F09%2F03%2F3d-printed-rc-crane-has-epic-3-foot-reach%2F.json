Have you ever wanted a little 3D printed version you could drive for yourself without the risk of demolishing your neighbors house? Well, [ProfessorBoots] has just the build for you.\nThe build, inspired by the Liebherr LTM 1300, isnt just a little RC car that looks like a crane. Its a real working crane, too! So you can drive this thing around, and you can park it up. Then you can deploy the fully working stabilizer booms like youre some big construction site hot shot. From there, you can relish in the subtle joy of extending the massive three-foot boom while the necessary counterweight automatically locks itself in place. You can then use the crane to lift and move small objects to your hearts content.\nThe video describes how the build works in intimate detail, from the gears and linkages all the way up to the grander assembly. Its no simple beast either, with ten gearmotors, four servos, and two ESP32s used for control. If you really need to build one for yourself, [ProfessorBoots] sells his plans on his website.\nWeve seen great stuff from [ProfessorBoots] before\u2014hes come a long way from his skid steer design last year. Video after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Hudson Bazemore] for the tip!", "title": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u7a93\u304b\u3089\u9053\u8def\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u3054\u8fd1\u6240\u3078\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5fc3\u914d\u305b\u305a\u306b\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u904b\u8ee2\u3067\u304d\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f[ProfessorBoots]\u304cLTM 1300\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u8da3\u5473\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u8a73\u7d30\u3084\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "Liebherr LTM 1300\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u5236\u5fa1", "\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

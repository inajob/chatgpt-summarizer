Back then, we had the convenience of expression on the WWW and the backup of mature services such as IRC for all that other stuff we used to get up to. Some of us still hang out there. Then something happened. Something terrible. Big-commerce took over, and it ballooned into this enormously complex mess with people tracking you every few seconds and constantly trying to bombard you with marketing messages. Enough now. Many people have had enough and have come together to create the Tildeverse, a minimalist community-driven internet experience.\nA collaborative Minecraft server hosted on a Tilde site\nTilde, literally  ~ , is your home on the internet. You can work on your ideas on a shared server or run your own. Tilde emphasises the retro aesthetic by being minimal and text-orientated. Those unfamiliar with a command line may start getting uncomfortable, but dont worry\u2014help is at hand. The number of activities is too many to list, but there are a few projects, such as a collaborative Sci-Fi story, a\u00a0radio station, and even a private VoIP server. Gamers are catered for\u00a0as long as you like Minecraft, but we think thats how it\u00a0should go.\nThe Tildeverse also supports Gopher and the new Gemini protocol,\u00a0 giving some people a few more options with which to tinker. The usual method to gain access is to first sign up on a server, then SSH into it; youre then taken to your little piece of the internet, ready to start your minimalist journey into the Tildeverse.\nA couple of videos after the break go into much more detail about the whys and hows of the Tildeverse and are worth a chunk of your time.\nWeve talked about the small web before. Heres our guide to Gemini.\n\n\n\nThanks to [Andrew] for the tip!", "title": "Tildeverse: \u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u4f53\u9a13", "body": "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eWeb\u306e\u767a\u660e\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u82b1\u958b\u304d\u3001IRC\u306a\u3069\u306e\u6210\u719f\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30b3\u30de\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u652f\u914d\u3057\u3001Tildeverse\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Tilde\u306f\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001Minecraft\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Tildeverse: \u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u4f53\u9a13", "Tilde: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30a8\u30b9\u30c6\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b", "Tildeverse: Gopher\u3084Gemini\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "Tildeverse: \u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3Minecraft\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc", "\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u307e\u3067\uff1aTildeverse\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u6d3b\u52d5"]}

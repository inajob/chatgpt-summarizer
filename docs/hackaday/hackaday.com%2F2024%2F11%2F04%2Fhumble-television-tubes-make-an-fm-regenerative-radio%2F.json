Its most often seen for AM band receivers or perhaps shortwave ham band ones, but its a circuit which also works at much higher frequencies. [Perian Marcel] has done just this, with a regenerative receiver for the FM broadcast band.\nThe principle of a regenerative receiver is that it takes a tuned radio frequency receiver with a wide bandwidth and poor performance, and applies feedback to the point at which the circuit is almost but not quite oscillating. This has the effect of hugely increasing the Q, or quality factor of the receiver, giving it much more sensitivity and a narrow bandwidth. Theyre tricky to tune but they can give reasonable performance, and they will happily slope-demodulate an FM transmission.\nThis one uses two tubes from consumer grade TV receivers, the P at the start of the part number being the giveaway for a 300mA series heater chain. The RF triode-pentode isnt a radio part at all, instead its a mundane TV field oscillator part pushed into service at higher frequencies, while the other triode-pentode serves as an audio amplifier. The original circuit from which this one is adapted is available online, All in all its a neat project, and a reminder that exotic parts arent always necessary at higher frequencies. The video is below the break.\n\n"}

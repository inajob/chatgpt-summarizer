Hence [V Electronics]s Spirit smartphone project, with the video from a few months ago introducing the project.\nAs noted on the hardware overview page, everything about the project uses off the shelf parts and modules, except for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5) carrier board. The LCD is a 5.5, 1280720 capacitive one currently, but this can be replaced with a compatible one later on, same as the camera and the CM5 board, with the latter swappable with any other CM5 or drop-in compatible solution.\nThe star of the show and the thing that puts the phone in smartphone is the Quectel EG25-GL LTE (4G) and GPS module which is also used in the still-not-very-open PinePhone. Although the design of the carrier board and the 3D printable enclosure are still somewhat in flux, the recent meeting notes show constant progress, raising the possibility that with perhaps some community effort this truly open hardware smartphone will become a reality.\n\n\nThanks to [tiel] for the tip.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u300cSpirit\u300d\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3068LTE\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u300cSpirit\u300d\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6982\u8981", "- \u5e02\u8ca9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- Quectel EG25-GL LTE\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9032\u5c55", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u529b\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

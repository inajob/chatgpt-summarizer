One of them stood head and shoulders above the rest: Commodores Amiga 1000. It had everything that could reasonably be stuffed into a machine of the period, and multimedia capabilities the rest wouldnt catch up on for years. [Celso Martinho] has managed to secure one of those first machines, and has shared his tale of bringing it back to life.\nThe post is as much a love letter to the Amiga and review of A1000 peripherals as it is a restoration, which makes it a good read for retrocomputing enthusiasts.\u00a0 He recapped it and it wouldnt boot, the solution of which turned out to be a reminder for the rest of us.\nThe machine had a RAM upgrade in the form of a daughterboard under the processor, its pins had weakened the leaves of the processor socket so it wouldnt make contact. So dont forget to replace sockets as well as capacitors.\nThe resulting machine is much faster thanks to a modern upgrade with a much quicker processor, memory, and an SD card for storage. He goes into some of the other upgrades available today, all of which would have had early-1990s-us salivating. Its fair to say that in 2025 an A1000 is more 40-year-old curio than useful modern computer, but we cant fail to admit to a bit of envy. The Amiga holds a special affection, here.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u534a\u3070\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u306eAmiga 1000\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u3001\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6539\u826f\u306b\u3088\u308a\u901f\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\uff1a\u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u5f37\u307f", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u8005\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269", "- \u6614\u306e\u540d\u6a5f\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30df\u30ac1000\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u79d8\u8a23"]}

And while there are emulators aplenty for almost every platform imaginable, the world of emulation is never complete. Thus were happy to encounter a new player in the form of MartyPC, a cycle-accurate 8088 PC emulator written in Rust.\nIts a project that started only in April 2022, but alongside such in-depth processor support it has the full range of PC and XT peripherals including CGA and VGA cards to the extent that it will run even the most hardware-demanding demos. Below the break you can see it running the fiendishly hardware-specific PC demo Area 5150  thought to be the first time an emulator has managed this task.\nIf theres a snag its that the releases are so far Windows-only, though its claimed that it should also compile on other major platforms. Theres also a WebAssembly version, though sadly the link to it doesnt work. We look forward to this emulator maturing, because were sure it will become a PC standby. After all, not everyone managed to snag one of the recent batch of new hardware.\n\n"}

One of the main drivers of this is its beachhead in industrial systems; the x86 architecture is backwards-compatible farther back than many of us have been alive and in situations where machines need to run for years with minimum downtime its good to know you can grab any x86 system off the shelf and itll largely work. This is also true for gaming, so if youre like [Yeo Kheng Meng] and want to run games like DOOM natively on modern hardware its certainly possible, although there are a few catches.\nThis build goes into the design of a modern AMD Ryzen 5 desktop computer, with all of the components selected specifically for their use running software more than three decades old now. [Yeo Kheng Meng] is targeting DOS 6.22 as his operating system of choice, meaning that modern EFI motherboards wont necessarily work. Hes turned to business class products as a solution for many of these issues, as motherboards targeting business and industrial customers often contain more support for antiquated hardware like PS/2 and parallel ports while still having modern amenities like DDR5 memory slots. PS/2 ports additionally are an indicator that the motherboard will supports older non-EFI boot modes (BIOS) and can potentially run DOS natively. Everything here can also run modern operating systems, since he isnt building this system only to run DOS and retro games.\nBeyond the motherboard choice, hes also using a Soundblaster card for audio which is a design choice generally relegated to history, but still used in modern gaming by a dedicated group. Theres also a floppy drive running via a USB header adapter cable. Of course, there are a few problems running DOS and other era-appropriate software natively on such incomprehensibly fast hardware (by early 90s standards). Some video games were hard coded to the processor clock of the x86 process of the era, so increasing the clock speed orders of magnitude results in several playability issues. In emulators its easier to provide an artificially slow clock speed, but on real hardware this isnt always possible. But [Yeo Kheng Meng] has done a lot to get this modern computer running older software like this. Another take weve seen for retro gaming on original hardware is this system which uses a brand-new 486 processor meant for use in industrial settings as well."}

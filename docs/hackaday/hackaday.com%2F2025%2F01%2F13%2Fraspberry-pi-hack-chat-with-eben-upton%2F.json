Weve been trying to get Raspberry Pi co-founder and CEO Eben Upton on the chat for a while, but there was that whole thing of taking the company public that probably distracted him a wee bit. Thats fine though, because we know he loves getting in the trenches with the hacker community and talking about the things we all love to talk about. Its not often that you get a chance for a one-on-one like this, so make sure you join us with all your Pi-related questions.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, January 15 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.\n[Image credit: Sniper Zeta, CC BY-SA 4.0]"}

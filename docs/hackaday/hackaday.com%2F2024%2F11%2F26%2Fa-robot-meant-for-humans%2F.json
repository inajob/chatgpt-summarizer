But this future isnt guaranteed, and a PhD researcher is hoping to claim back a more hopeful outlook with a robot called Blossom which is specifically built to investigate how humans interact with robots.\nFor a platform this robot is not too complex, consisting of an accessible frame that can be laser-cut from wood with only a few moving parts controlled by servos. The robot is not too large, either, and can be set on a desk to be used as a telepresence robot. But Blossoms creator [Michael] wanted this to help understand how humans interact with robots so the latest version is outfitted not only with a large language model with text-to-speech capabilities, but also with a compelling backstory, lore, and a voice derived from Animal Crossing thats neither human nor recognizable synthetic robot, all in an effort to make the device more approachable.\nTo that end, [Michael] set the robot up at a Maker Faire to see what sorts of interactions Blossom would have with passers by, and while most were interested in the web-based control system for the robot a few others came by and had conversations with it. Its certainly an interesting project and reminds us a bit of this other piece of research from MIT that looked at how humans and robots can work productively alongside one another.", "title": "- \u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5\u30e0\u300d", "body": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBlossom\u300d\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u306e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3057\u3001\u89aa\u3057\u307f\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3002Maker Faire\u3067\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5\u30e0\u300d", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u300c\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc", "- \u4eba\u9593\u3068\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4fc3\u9032\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30e1\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30b5\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u53cd\u97ff"]}

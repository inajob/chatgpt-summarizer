You might like Dendrite, the direction-finding hat from [SolidStat3].\nDendrite is intended for hunting down Bluetooth devices. Its capable of direction estimation based on signal strength readings from four ESP32 microcontrollers mounted on an off-the-shelf hard hat. Each ESP32 searches for BLE devices in the immediate area and reports the apparent signal strength to a fifth ESP32, which collates readings from all units. It then runs a simple multilateration algorithm to estimate the direction of the device. This information is then displayed via a ring of addressable LEDs around the perimeter of the hat. White LEDs marking the direction of the detected device. The only problem? You cant see the LEDs while youre wearing the hat. You might need a friend to help you or you can simply take it off to see what its doing.\nUltimately, this project is a useful direction-finding hard hat that would also make a perfect prop from an episode of\u00a0Inspector Spacetime. Weve covered direction finding in other contexts before, too. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own innovative hard hat (or radio) hacks, dont hesitate to let us know!", "title": "- Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u635c\u7d22\u7528\u306e\u65b9\u5411\u63a2\u77e5\u5e3d\u5b50\u300cDendrite\u300d", "body": "Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u63a2\u3059\u65b9\u5411\u6307\u793a\u5e3d\u300cDendrite\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002LED\u3067\u65b9\u5411\u3092\u793a\u3059\u304c\u3001\u88c5\u7740\u4e2d\u306f\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u635c\u7d22\u7528\u306e\u65b9\u5411\u63a2\u77e5\u5e3d\u5b50\u300cDendrite\u300d", "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fBluetooth\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f37\u5ea6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u8853", "- LED\u3067\u65b9\u5411\u3092\u793a\u3059\u304c\u304b\u3076\u308c\u306a\u3044\uff01Dendrite\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff01Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u63a2\u3057\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b", "- \u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5f62\u306b\uff01\u79d1\u5b66\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u98a8\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30cf\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

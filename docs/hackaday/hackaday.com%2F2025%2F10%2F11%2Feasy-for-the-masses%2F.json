We thought we had a good handle on the topic.\nThen, we were talking about Google\u2019s plans to require an ID for Android developers, and whether or not this will shut down free and open software development on the Android platform. Would this be the end of the ability to run whatever software that you\u2019d like on your phone? Google offered the figleaf that \u201csideloading\u201d \u2013 installing software through methods other than Google\u2019s official store, would still be be allowed. But there\u2019s a catch \u2013 you have to use Android Debug Bridge (ADB).\nIs that a relief? It surely means that I will be able to install anything I want: I use ADB all the time, because it\u2019s one of the fastest and easiest ways to transfer files and update software on the device. But how many non-techies do you know who use ADB? We\u2019d guess that requiring this step shuts out 99.9% of Android users. If you make software hard to install for the masses, even if you make it possible for the geeks, you\u2019re effectively killing it.\nI have long wondered why end-to-end encrypted e-mail isn\u2019t the default. After all, getting a GPG signing key, distributing it to your friends, and then reading mail with supporting software shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, right? If GPG signing were available by default in Outlook or GMail, everyone would sign their e-mail. But there is no dead-simple, non-techie friendly way to do so, and so nobody does it.\nRequiring ADB to load Android software is going to have the same effect, and it\u2019s poised to severely restrict the amount of good, open software we have on the platform unless we can figure out a way to make installing that software easy enough that even the naive users can do it.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

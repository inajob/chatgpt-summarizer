But the Atari 2600 version, released in 1982, left players scratching their heads  as laid out in a video by [Almost Something]. Atari had licensed Pac-Man to ride the wave of its arcade success, but the home version, programmed solely by [Todd Fry], missed the mark, turning an arcade icon into a surprising lesson in over-ambitious marketing.\nDespite the hype, [Fry] faced an almost impossible task: translating Pac-Man\u2019s detailed graphics and complex gameplay to the Atari\u2019s limited 4 K cartridge with only 128 bytes of RAM. Atari\u2019s strict limitations on black backgrounds and its choice to cut costs by sticking with a 4 K cartridge left the game barely recognizable. The famous pellet-chomping maze became simpler, colors were changed, and the iconic ghosts\u2014reduced to single colors\u2014flickered constantly. And then, Atari went all in, producing twelve million copies, betting on the success of universal appeal. In a twist, Pac-Man did sell in record numbers (over seven million copies) but still fell short of Atari\u2019s expectations, leaving millions of unsold cartridges eventually dumped in a New Mexico landfill.\nThis debacle even kind of marked Atari\u2019s 1983 decline. Still, Pac-Man survived the hiccup, evolving and outlasting its flawed adaptation on the 2600.

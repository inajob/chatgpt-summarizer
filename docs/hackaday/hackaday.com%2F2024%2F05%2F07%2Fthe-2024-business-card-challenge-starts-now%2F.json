But even if you\u2019re just hacking for fun, you can still turn your calling into your calling card.\nWe are inviting you to submit your coolest business card hacks for us all to admire, and the top three entries will win a $150 DigiKey shopping spree.\u00a0 If your work can fit on a business card, create a project page for it over on Hackaday.io and enter it in the 2024 Business Card Contest. Share your tiny hacks!\nTo enter, create a project for your hacked business card over at Hackaday IO, and then enter it into the 2024 Business Card Challenge by selecting the pulldown on the left. It\u2019s that easy.\n\nHonorable Mentions\nSince we always get more fantastic submissions than we have prizes, we love to recognize entries that stand out. These Honorable Mention categories to highlight those who rise to the challenge.\n\nWafer Thin: A \u201cnormal\u201d business card is about 1 mm thick. That\u2019s a tough ask for a fully functional project, but let\u2019s just say that for this category, there\u2019s no such thing as too thin. Let\u2019s see what you can do.\nAesthetics: This category is for you artists out there. Squeeze the most beauty possible into a business card form factor.\nMadman Muntz: Paper business cards are insanely cheap to produce \u2013 custom electronics projects, not so much. But clever component choice and corner cutting can go a long way. For this category, we\u2019d like to see how inexpensively you can get your cards made.\nFun and Games: Nothing says \u201cwork\u201d like a business card. Flip the script with a business card that\u2019s a toy at heart.\nUtilitarian: Can you actually get something useful done within the size limits? How much functionality can you fit in your wallet?\n\nMore Inspiration\nNeed some inspiration? Check out these business card projects on Hackaday.\nMaybe one of the first business card hacks that we ever featured was Hackaday alum [Ian Lesnet]\u2019s How-To: Web Server On A Business Card. This one\u2019s probably a history lesson today, because it was done in the days of slow microcontrollers with no inbuilt WiFi. Check out that Ethernet dongle attachment!\nFlashing forward to the present, [Ryan Chan] designed a business card that, in addition to his contact information, also has a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game built in. [Beast Devices]\u2019s smart business cards do away with the battery entirely by drawing their power from NFC, and are probably eminently hackable too, thanks to those sweet test points for programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Michael Teeuw] designed these PCBs that sport small OLED screens to display contact info and even have a hidden easter egg. [Alex.puffer]\u2019s card is classy and simple, and nobody out there needs to ask if he could have done it simply with a 555 timer.\nNow its your turn. Head on over to Hackaday.io put your business card in the running. The contest runs between Tuesday, May 7, 2024 09:00 am PDT and Tuesday, July 2, 2024 09:00 am PDT, so get going.\nThanks again to DigiKey for sponsoring this contest with the $150 prizes!"}

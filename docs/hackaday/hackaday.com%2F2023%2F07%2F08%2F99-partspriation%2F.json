That doesn\u2019t leave much room for partspriation.\nI\u2019m working on a top-secret project, and had to place a parts order on AliExpress with a minimum order quantity of five in order to get decent shipping times. No big deal, financially, and it\u2019s always great to have spares as backup for the ones you fry.\nBut as I started lighting up the little round smartwatch displays to put them through their paces, I started thinking of all sorts of ways that I could use something like this. I had no idea how easy to drive they were, or frankly, how good they looked in person. When you get a round display in your hands, you find that you need dial indicators everywhere.\nAnd then my son came by and said \u201cOh neat. I want one!\u201d and started thinking up all sorts of gizmos that I could put them in. Two of them would make awesome eyes, and he\u2019s been on a chameleon kick \u2013 the animal, you know. So we\u2019re looking for chameleon eye animations online.\nAnd all of a sudden, I have more projects lined up than I have remaining screens. I\u2019m calling this phenomenon \u201cpartspiration\u201d. You know, when you figure out how to use something and then you see uses for it everywhere? Time to place another Ali order.\nGearing Up for the Hackaday Prize\nAnd don\u2019t forget, we just started the next round of the Hackaday Prize: Gearing Up.

The tricky part, other than physically liberating them from whatever they are installed in, is figuring out if theyre worth keeping or not. Just because an 18650 cell takes a charge doesnt necessarily mean its any good  it could have vastly reduced capacity, or fail under heavy load.\nIf youre going to take salvaging these cells seriously, you should really invest in a charger that is capable of running some capacity tests against the cell. Or if youre a bit more adventurous, you can build this Battery Health Monitor designed by [DIY GUY Chris]. Although the fact that it can only accept a single cell at a time is certainly a limitation if youve got a lot of batteries to go though, the fact that its portable and only needs a USB-C connection for power means you can take it with you on your salvaging adventures.\nThe key to this project is a pair of chips from Texas Instruments. The BQ27441 is a Fuel Gauge IC, and is able to determine an 18650s current capacity, which can be compared to the cells original design capacity to come up with an estimate of its overall health. The other chip, the BQ24075, keeps an eye on all the charging parameters to make sure the cell is being topped up safely and efficiently.\nWith these two purpose-built chips doing a lot of the heavy lifting, it only takes a relatively simple microcontroller to tie them together and provide user feedback. In this case [DIY GUY Chris] has gone with the ATmega328P, with a pair of addressable WS2812B LED bars to show the batterys health and charge levels. As an added bonus, if you plug the device into your computer, it will output charging statistics over the serial port.\nThe whole project is released under the MIT license, and everything from the STL files for the 3D printed enclosure to the MCUs Arduino-flavored firmware is provided. If youre looking to build one yourself, you can either follow along with the step-by-step assembly instructions, or watch the build video below. Or really treat yourself and do both  you deserve it.\nIf your battery salvaging operation is too large for a single-cell tester, perhaps its time to upgrade to this 40-slot wall mounted unit.\n\n", "title": "\u300c18650\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u30b5\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d", "body": "18650\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u56de\u53ce\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u306eDIY\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c18650\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u30b5\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d", "\u300c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d8\u30eb\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6982\u8981\u300d", "\u300cTexas Instruments\u88fd\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "\u300cATmega328P\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "\u300c\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u96fb\u6c60\u30b5\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a40\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u300d"]}

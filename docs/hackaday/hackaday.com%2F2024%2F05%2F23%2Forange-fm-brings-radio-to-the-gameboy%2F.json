You left your Walkman at home and only have your trusty Game Boy. You want to take a break and just listen to some tunes. What to do? [orangeglo] has the answer now with the Orange FM cartridge.\nThis prototype cart features an onboard antenna or can also use the 3.5 mm headphone/antenna port on the cartridge to boost reception with either a dedicated antenna or a set of headphones. Frequencies supported are 64  108 Mhz, and spacing can be set for 100 or 200 kHz to accomodate most FM broadcasts setups around the world.\nOlder Game Boys can support audio through the device itself, but Advances will need to use the audio port on the cartridge. The Super Game Boy can pipe audio to your TV though, which seems like a delightfully Rube Goldberg-ian way to listen to the radio. Did we mention it also supports RDS, so youll know what that catchy tune is? Try that FM Walkman!\nCant decide between this and your other carts? Try this revolving multi-cart solution. Have a Game Boy that needs some restoration? If its due to electrolyte damage, maybe start here?\n\n"}

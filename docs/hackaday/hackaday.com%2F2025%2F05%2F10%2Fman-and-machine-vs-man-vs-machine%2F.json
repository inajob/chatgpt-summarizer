I\u2019m absolutely sure that he\u2019s exaggerating, but the gist is that he\u2019s much happier to work on stuff in CAD and let the machine take care of the precision and fine physical details. I\u2019m like that too, but with me, it\u2019s the artwork.\nI can\u2019t draw to save my life, but once I get it into digital form, I\u2019m pretty good at manipulating images. And then I couldn\u2019t copy that out into the real world, but that\u2019s what the laser cutter is for, right? So the gameplan for this year\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day gift (reminder!) is three-way. I do the physical design, my son does the artwork, we combine them in FreeCAD and then hand it off to the machine. Everyone is playing to their strengths.\nSo why does it feel a little like cheating to just laser-cut out a present? I\u2019m not honestly sure. My grandfather was a trained architectural draftsman before he let his artistic side run wild and went off to design jewellery. He could draw a nearly perfect circle with nothing more than a pencil, but he also used a French curve set, a pantograph, and a rolling architect\u2019s ruler when they were called for. He had his tools too, and I bet he\u2019d see the equivalence in mine.\nPeople have used tools since the stone age, and the people who master their tools transcend them, and produce work where the \u201chuman\u201d shines through despite having traced a curve or having passed the Gcode off to the cutter. If you doubt this, I\u2019ll remind you of the technological feat that is the piano, with which people nonetheless produce music that doesn\u2019t make you think of the hammers or of the tremendous cast metal frame. The tech disappears into the creation.\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a parable here for our modern use of AI too, but I\u2019ve got a Mother\u2019s Day present to finish.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

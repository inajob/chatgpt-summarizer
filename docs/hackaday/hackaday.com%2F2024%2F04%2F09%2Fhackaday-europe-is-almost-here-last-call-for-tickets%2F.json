Things get rolling on Friday with a pre-event meetup. But Saturday is when things really kick into high gear. Before the days out, well have played host to nearly a dozen speakers and  literally  more workshops than we could fit into the schedule. Two workshops will be floating events that will happen once enough interested parties have congregated in one place. Well keep things going until well past midnight, which leads directly into Sunday. We want to get a few sessions of lightning talks packed in, so start coming up with your talk ideas now.\nThe Vectorscope will be making its European debut.\nIn addition, there will be food, music, camaraderie, badge hacking, and the general technolust surrounding a Hackaday event. In our humble and totally unbiased opinion, we put on some of the best and most unique hardware hacking meetups in the world  if you like reading Hackaday, youll love living it for a couple of days.\nAs of this writing, we still have a very few tickets for Hackaday Europe 2024 available. Want one? Head over to the Eventbrite page. But you better hurry. Were talking a literal handful here, so dont be surprised if theyve dried up by the time you read this.\nThe workshops have all sold out, but as usual, well be running a waiting list right up until the last minute: should anyone have to drop out of a workshop (which happens more than you might think), their spot will go to the person next in line. If youd like to get on the list, email prize@hackaday.com with your name, ticket number, and the workshop youre hoping to sneak into, and well see what we can do.\nBut dont let the workshops stop you. Theres still plenty to see, do, and experience. See you there!"}

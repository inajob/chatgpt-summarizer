This is even more important if youre going out hiking, because youre going to be out in a more rugged environment. To aid in this regard, [Mukesh Sankhla] built a tool called Enhiker.\nThe concept is simple; its intended to tell you everything you need to know about current and pending conditions before heading out on a hike. Its based around Unihiker, a single-board computer which also conveniently features a 2.8-inch touch screen. Its a quad-core ARM device that runs Debian and has WiFi and Bluetooth built in, too. The device is able to query its GPS/GNSS receiver for location information, and then uses this to get accurate weather data online from OpenWeatherMap. It makes some basic analysis, too. For example, it can tell you if its a good time to go out, or if theres a storm likely rolling in, or if the conditions are hot enough to make heat stroke a concern.\nIts a nifty little gadget, and its neat to have all the relevant information displayed on one compact device. Wed love to see it upgraded further with cellular connectivity in addition to WiFi; this would make it more capable when out and about.\nWeve seen some other neat hiking hacks before, too, like this antenna built with a hiking pole. Meanwhile, if youve got your own neat hacks for when youre out on the trail, dont hesitate to let us know!", "title": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u6e96\u5099\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u300cEnhiker\u300d", "body": "\u5929\u5019\u3092\u4e8b\u524d\u306b\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u300cEnhiker\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u6e96\u5099\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u300cEnhiker\u300d", "\u5358\u677f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u5929\u6c17\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u53d6\u5f97", "\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u6a5f\u80fd\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb", "Unihiker\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5929\u5019\u5206\u6790\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u4e2d\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853"]}

But no machine is so simple that a little needless complexity cant make it better, as is the case with this mechanical spinning dice. Or die. Whatever.\nInspiration for the project came from [Attoparsec]s long history with RPG and tabletop games, which depend on different kinds of dice to generate the randomness that keeps them going  that and the fortuitous find of a seven-segment flip-dot display, plus the need for something cool to show off at OpenSauce. The flip-dot is controlled by an array of neodymium magnets with the proper polarity to flip the segments to the desired number. The magnets are attached to an aluminum disk, with each array spread out far enough to prevent interference. [Attoparsec] also added a ring of magnets to act as detents that lock the disk into a specific digit after a spin.\nThe finished product ended up being satisfyingly clicky and suitably random, and made a good impression at OpenSauce. The video below documents the whole design and build process, and includes some design dead-ends that [Attoparsec] went down in pursuit of a multiple-digit display. Wed love to see him revisit some of these ideas, mechanically difficult though they may be. And while hes at it, maybe he could spice up the rolls with a little radioactivity.\n\n"}

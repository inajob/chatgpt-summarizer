[PCAutomotive] has shared its exploit for turning the 2020 Nissan Leaf into 1600 kg RC car. [PDF via Electrek]\nStarting with some scavenged infotainment systems and wiring harnesses, the group built test benches able to tear into vulnerabilities in the system. An exploit was found in the infotainment systems Bluetooth implementation, and they used this to gain access to the rest of the system. By jamming the 2.4 GHz spectrum, the attacker can nudge the driver to open the Bluetooth connection menu on the vehicle to see why their phone isnt connecting. If this menu is open, pairing can be completed without further user interaction.\nOnce the attacker gains access, they can control many vehicle functions, such as steering, braking, windshield wipers, and mirrors. It also allows remote monitoring of the vehicle through GPS and recording audio in the cabin. The vulnerabilities were all disclosed to Nissan before public release, so be sure to keep your infotainment system up-to-date!\nIf this feels familiar, we featured a similar hack on Tesla infotainment systems. If youd like to hack your Leaf for the better, weve also covered how to fix some of the vehicles charging flaws, but we cant help you with the loss of app support for early models.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5", "body": "2020\u5e74\u65e5\u7523\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u66f4\u65b0\u304c\u63a8\u5968\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5", "- 2020\u65e5\u7523\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30921600kg\u306eRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306eBluetooth\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u8eca\u4e21\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8106\u5f31\u6027", "- \u65e5\u7523\u3078\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5831\u544a\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

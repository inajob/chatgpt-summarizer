They were purpose-built to produce a very specific type and shape of light, but [Julius Curt] has taken this in a new, upcycled direction. Instead of just producing light, the light itself is also part of the aesthetic. A very cool 3D printed case houses the bulb and power supply and smartly hides the connecting wires to achieve a very clean look.\n\nPart of the design involves adding a DC-DC converter before the lamp driver, allowing fading of the light. This isnt anything new in lamps, but [Julius] noticed an interesting effect when dimming the vertically oriented lamp: as the power was reduced, the column of light would start to extinguish from one end, leading to an elongated teardrop-shaped light source.\nThis leads to a very interesting look, and the neat case design leads to an extremely unique lamp! The emitted lights color temperature seems to vary a bit as the voltage drops, going from what appears to be a pretty cold white to a slightly warmer tone.\nThe design process is detailed on the project page, with a quick look at the CAD design process for the case. A neat touch was using a greeble (part of a coffee grinder) to add some different textures and break up the plastic-only look. Thats one well have to note in our design books!\n\n", "title": "\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u7167\u660e", "body": "\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u5185\u306e\u96fb\u7403\u306f\u5e83\u3044\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u5149\u3092\u51fa\u3059\u86cd\u5149\u7ba1\u3067\u3001\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u8584\u6697\u304f\u3059\u308b\u3068\u6d99\u6ef4\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5149\u6e90\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002\u8272\u6e29\u5ea6\u3082\u5909\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306f\u65ac\u65b0\u3067\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u7167\u660e", "\u6d99\u6ef4\u578b\u5149\u6e90\u3092\u751f\u30803D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "DC-DC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u5149\u6e90\u306e\u8272\u6e29\u5ea6\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7", "CAD\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u5236\u4f5c"]}

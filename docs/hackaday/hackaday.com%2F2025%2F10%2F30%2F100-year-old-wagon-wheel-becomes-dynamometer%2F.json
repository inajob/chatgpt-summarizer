If you want to do similar testing at a smaller scale, though, you might find its easier to build your own rig, like [Lou] did.\n[Lous] dynamometer is every bit a DIY project, relying on a 100-year-old wagon wheel as the flywheel installed in a simple frame cobbled together from 66 timber beams. As you might imagine, a rusty old wagon wheel probably wouldnt be in great condition, and that was entirely true here. [Lou] put in the work to balance it up with some added weights, before measuring its inertia with a simple falling weight test. The wheel is driven via a chain with a 7:1 gear reduction to avoid spinning it too quickly. Logging the data is a unit from BlackBoxDyno, which uses hall effect sensors to measure engine RPM and flywheel RPM. With this data and a simple calibration, its possible to calculate the torque and horsepower of a small engine hooked up to the flywheel.\nFew of us are bench testing our lawnmowers for the ultimate performance, but if you are, a build like this could really come in handy. Weve seen other dyno builds before, too.

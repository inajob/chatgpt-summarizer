[Uncle Jessy] came across an idea he decided to try out for himself: spraying Bondo spot putty onto a 3D print. Bondo spot putty comes from a tube, cures quickly, and sands smoothly. Its commonly used to hide defects and give 3D prints a great finish. Could spraying liquified Bondo putty onto a 3D print save time, or act as a cheat code for hiding layer lines? [Uncle Jessy] decided to find out.\nGaps and larger flaws still need to be filled by hand, but spray application seems to be a big time saver if nothing else.\nThe first step is to turn the distinctive red putty into something that can be sprayed through a cheap, ten dollar airbrush. That part was as easy as squeezing putty into a cup and mixing in acetone in that-looks-about-right proportions. A little test spray showed everything working as expected, so [Uncle Jessy] used an iron man mask (smooth surfaces on the outside, textured inside) for a trial run.\nSpraying the liquified Bondo putty looks about as easy as spraying paint. The distinctive red makes it easy to see coverage, and it cures very rapidly. Its super easy to quickly give an object an even coating  even in textured and uneven spots  which is an advantage all on its own. To get a truly smooth surface one still needs to do some sanding, but the application itself looks super easy.\nIs it worth doing? [Uncle Jessy] says it depends. First of all, aerosolizing Bondo requires attention to be paid to safety. Theres also a fair bit of setup involved (and a bit of mess) so it might not be worth the hassle for small pieces, but for larger objects it seems like a huge time saver. It certainly seems to cover layer lines nicely, but one is still left with a Bondo-coated object in the end that might require additional sanding, so its not necessarily a cheat code for a finished product.\nIf you think the procedure might be useful, check out the video (embedded below) for a walkthrough. Just remember to do it in a well-ventilated area and wear appropriate PPE.\nAn alternative to applying Bondo is brush application of UV resin, but weve also seen interesting results from non-planar ironing.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u306b\uff01Bondo\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30d1\u30c6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306bBondo\u30d1\u30c6\u3092\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3057\u3001\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u696d\u6642\u9593\u77ed\u7e2e\u306b\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3060\u304c\u53cd\u9762\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u3082\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u306b\uff01Bondo\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30d1\u30c6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u624b\u9593\u3044\u3089\u305a\u3067\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\uff01\u30a8\u30a2\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3067Bondo\u3092\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5c64\u7dda\u3092\u96a0\u3059\uff1f\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fcBondo\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c", "- \u5927\u578b\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306e\u6642\u77ed\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\uff1aBondo\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30d1\u30c6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052", "- \u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8cea\u4f7f\u7528\u6642\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068Bondo\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

Like the title implies, TypeBoy and TypePak are inseparable.\nLets talk about TypePak first. Somehow, some way, [Stu] managed to fit the following into an aftermarket Game Boy Advance cartridge: a XIAO BLE microcontroller, a Sharp Memory Display, a shift register, and a LiPo battery. Its all there in [Stu]s incredibly detailed blog post linked above.\nAmazing, no? And although [Stu] claims that the TypePak is mostly for aesthetics (boy howdy), it will make swapping microcontrollers much easier in the future.\nIf this looks sort of familiar, you may remember a likely render of [mujimaniac]s board called the GIGA40 that also employed a cartridge system. Allegedly there is now a working prototype of the GIGA40.\nWould you like to give the TypeBoy and TypePak a go? Files are available on GitHub, but this doesnt seem like a project for the faint of heart.\nSpeaking of stuffing things in to Game Boy cartridges, check out this SNES cartridge turned hard drive enclosure.\nVia KBD"}

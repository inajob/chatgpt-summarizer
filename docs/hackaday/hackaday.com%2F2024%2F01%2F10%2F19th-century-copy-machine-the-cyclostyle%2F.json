But these days, you are more likely to simply print multiple copies of a document. However, it wasnt long ago that making a copy of a document was a tall order. Carbon paper was fine if you were typing and only needed a few copies. But in the late 1800s to early 1900s, several solutions were available, including a beautiful early mimeograph known as the Cyclostyle at [Our Own Devices], examined in the video below.\nThe Cyclostyle was possibly inspired by a hectograph (something we looked at before). The Cyclostyle was originally a special stylus used to remove wax from a paper stencil. Then, a process similar to screen printing would make copies for you.\n\nThe video mentions several other copying systems, including one that used shellac and corrosive ink. He also talks about Edisons electric system to produce stencils that eventually led to both tattoo guns and the A.B. Dick mimeograph.\nIf you want to jump straight to the hardware and skip the history  but we dont recommend that  you can start at minute 7 of the video. The specific machine probably dates to 1910 or so and was made in the UK and sold in Canada. A.B. Dick dominated the market in the United States.\nA great look at a grand old machine. Weve looked at copiers similar to this one and up to the original Xerox machines. If you really want to do real printing, why not 3D print a letterpress?\n"}

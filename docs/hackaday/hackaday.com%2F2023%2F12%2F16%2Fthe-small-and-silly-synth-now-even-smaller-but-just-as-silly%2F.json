Why, build an even smaller and less useful synthesizer, of course!\nIf youve been paying even a minimal amount of attention youll know right away that this comes to use from [mitxela], who while not playing with volumetric POV displays is often found building smaller and smaller synthesizers, including putting them in DIN plug shells. The current synth is based on his Silly Synth, which puts all the guts for the synth inside a USB connector. This time around, though, its USB-C, and rather than fitting everything inside the connector shell, the entire synth sits on a PCB thats smaller than a tiny piezo speaker. The whole thing runs on a CH32V003 microcontroller, and aside from a few support components and the right-angle USB-C plug, not much else.\nThe PCB is what really shines in [mitxela]s design, especially the routing. Hes got a 20-pin QFN chip on one side of the board and the USB plug right behind it on the other side to deal with, plus the big through-holes for the speaker and the physical connections on the plug. Its quite a crowded design, but it gets the job done. Whats more, he panelized the design so that mass production is possible; the reason for this is revealed at the end of the video below.\nPretty much every time we see one of these smallest synth videos were convinced that were seeing the lower limit of whats possible, but every time, [mitxela] goes ahead and proves us wrong. Thats fine, of course  we dont mind being wrong about something like this.\n\n\nThanks to [hackbyte] and [Stephen Walters] for the tips.", "title": "\"USB-C\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306b\u53ce\u7d0d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\"", "body": "[mitxela]\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3066\u4f7f\u3044\u7269\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u8a55\u5224\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u5f8c\u3001\u5f7c\u306f\u3055\u3089\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3066\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002USB-C\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u307b\u3069\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306aPCB\u306b\u5168\u3066\u3092\u53ce\u3081\u3001\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u9032\u3081\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d1\u30cd\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3082\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002[mitxela]\u306f\u5e38\u306b\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"USB-C\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306b\u53ce\u7d0d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\"", "\"\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u304c20\u30d4\u30f3QFN\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u642d\u8f09\"", "\"DIN\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3001\u3088\u308a\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\"", "\"PH32V003\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\"", "\"\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\""]}

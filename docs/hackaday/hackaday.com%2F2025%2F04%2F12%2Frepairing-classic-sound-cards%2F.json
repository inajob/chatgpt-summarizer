By the mid to late 1990s they were affordable and ubiquitous enough to be everywhere, but three decades later some of them are starting to fail. [Necroware] takes us through the repair of a couple of Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16s, which were the card to have back then.\nThe video below is a relaxed look at typical problems afflicting second-hand cards with uncertain pasts. Theres a broken PCB trace on the first one, which receives a neat repair. The second one has a lot more wrong with it though, and reveals some surprises. We would have found the dead 74 series chips, but were not so sure wed have immediately suspected a resistor network as the culprit.\nWatching these cards become sought-after in the 2020s is a little painful for those of us who were there at the time, because its certain we wont be the only ones who cleared out a pile of old ISA cards back in the 2000s. If you find one today and dont have an ISA slot, worry not, because you can still interface it via your LPC bus.\n\n"}

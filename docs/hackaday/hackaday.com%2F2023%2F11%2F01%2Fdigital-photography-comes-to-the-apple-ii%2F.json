The QuickTake 100 used a novel flat form factor and at its highest resolution could only shoot 640480 images, but at the time it was a genuine object of desire. It came in Windows and Apple versions, and to use the Apple variant required a Mac of the day with appropriate software.\nThe interface was an Apple serial connector though, so it was quite reasonable for [Colin Leroy-Mira] to wonder whether it could work with Apples 8-bit machines. The result is QuickTake for the Apple IIc, the product that perhaps Apple should have brought us in an alternative 1994.\nFortunately the protocol has already been reverse engineered and forms part of the dcraw package, however the process of extracting the code wasnt easy. The full resolution and colour of the original pictures has to be sacrificed, and of course once the custom serial cable has been made its a painfully slow process transferring the pictures. But to get anything running in this way on such elderly hardware which was never intended to\u00a0 perform this task is an extremely impressive feat. We would have given anything for this, back in the 8-bit days.\nIf you have a QuickTake and want to use a more modern machine, weve got you covered there, too."}

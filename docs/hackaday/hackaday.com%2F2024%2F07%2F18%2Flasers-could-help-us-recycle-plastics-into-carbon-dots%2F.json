Still, as reported by\u00a0Sci-Tech Daily, there may be help on the way from our good friend, the laser!\nThe research paper\u00a0 from the University of Texas outlines the use of lasers for breaking down tough plastics into their baser components. The method isnt quite as simple as fire a laser off at the plastic, though. First, the material must be laid on a special two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide material  a type of atomically-thin semiconductor at the very forefront of current research. When the plastics are placed under the right laser light in this scenario, carbon-hydrogen bonds in the plastic are broken and transformed, creating new chemical bonds. Done right, and you can synthesize luminescent carbon dots from the plastic itself!\nBy harnessing these unique reactions, we can explore new pathways for transforming environmental pollutants into valuable, reusable chemicals, contributing to the development of a more sustainable and circular economy, says Yuebing Zheng, a leader on the project. \u201cThis discovery has significant implications for addressing environmental challenges and advancing the field of green chemistry.\nSure its a bit trickier than turning old drink bottles into filament, but it could be very useful to researchers and those investigating high-tech materials solutions. Dont forget to read up on the sheer immensity of the worlds plastic recycling problems, either. If youve got the solution, let us know!"}

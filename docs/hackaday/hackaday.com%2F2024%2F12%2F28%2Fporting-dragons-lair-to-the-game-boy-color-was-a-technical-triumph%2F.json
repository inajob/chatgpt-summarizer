It didnt look or play like anything else. So it might come as a surprise that it was ported to Nintendos Game Boy Color, and that took some doing!\nDragons Lair used LaserDisc technology, and gameplay was a series of what wed today call quick-time events (QTE). The player essentially navigated a series of brief video clips strung together by QTEs. Generally, if the player chose correctly the narrative would progress. If they chose poorly, well, thats what extra lives (and a stack of quarters) were for.\nMore after the break!\n\nSimplifying graphics and reducing frame rate wasnt enough, and developers needed to get truly clever to hit targets.\nThe Game Boy Color was a fantastic piece of handheld gaming hardware, but it was still quite limited. Porting Dragons Lair to the GBC required not only technical cleverness, but quite a few ingenious tricks along the way. Some methods were straightforward. Limiting the frame rate to ten frames per second looked acceptable and saved space, and audio was likewise limited to simple tones and only a few key samples from the original game.\nEven so, compression and simplified graphics just wasnt enough. Cramming everything onto an 8 megabyte cartridge took the form of a custom quantizing tool called the Tile Killer. This tool allowed artists to perform meticulous frame-by-frame optimization of graphics and color palettes in a way that maximized compression savings, squishing animated sequences down to target sizes in a semi-automated way. When steered by an experienced artist who understood constraints and didnt need sleep, it was a clever and powerful tool.\nThe end result was a port of Dragons Lair that frankly looked impressive as heck, and released to positive reviews. It was a technical triumph, but commercially it made rather less of an impact. Still, its really impressive what got pulled off. You can watch it in action in the video embedded below.\nThe GBC port of Dragons Lair may not have been a commercial success, but at least mounds of unsold copies never ended up in a landfill like E.T. for the Atari 2600 did. Console ports arent the only task that requires clever developers; upscaling video games brings its own unique technical challenges.\n", "title": "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d\u79fb\u690d\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u6311\u6226", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d\u304cGBC\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u6280\u8853\u7684\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u8a55\u4fa1\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d\u79fb\u690d\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u6311\u6226", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- \u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d\u306e\u753b\u9762\u6700\u9069\u5316\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300c\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u300d", "- \u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5bb9\u91cf\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af", "- \u5546\u696d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u306b\u306f\u81f3\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3059\u3079\u304d\u79fb\u690d\u4f5c\u54c1\u300c\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30a2\u300d"]}

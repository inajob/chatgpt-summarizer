Currently lithium-ion and similar (e.g. Li-Po) rule the roost due to their high energy density at least acceptable number of recharge cycles, but aluminium-ion (Al-ion) may become a more viable competitor after a recently published paper by Chinese researchers claims to have overcome some of the biggest hurdles. In the paper as published in\u00a0ACS Central Science by [Ke Guo] et al. the use of solid-state electrolyte, a charge cycle endurance beating LiFePO4 (LFP) and excellent recyclability are claimed.\nIts been known for a while that theoretically Al-ion batteries can be superior to Li-ion in terms of energy density, but the difficulty lies in the electrolyte, including its interface with the electrodes. The newly developed electrolyte (F-SSAF) uses aluminium-fluoride (AlF3) to provide a reliable interface between the aluminium and carbon electrodes, with the prototype cell demonstrating 10,000 cycles with very little cell degradation. Here the AlF3 provides the framework for the EMIC-AlCl3 electrolyte. FEC (fluoroethylene carbonate) is introduced to resolve electrolyte-electrode interface issues.\nA recovery of 80% of the AlF3 during a recycling phase is also claimed, which for a prototype seems to be a good start. Of course, as the authors note in their conclusion, other frameworks than AlF3 are still to be investigated, but this study brings Al-ion batteries a little bit closer to that ever-elusive step of commercialization and dislodging Li-ion.", "title": "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5c55", "body": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u304c\u5546\u696d\u5316\u306b\u8fd1\u3065\u304f\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u9032\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5c55", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u512a\u4f4d\u6027\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u89e3\u8cea\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "10,000\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u9054\u6210\uff01\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0-\u30d5\u30eb\u30aa\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u89e3\u8cea\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u6c60\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u5411\u4e0a", "\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u738780\uff05\uff01\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5546\u696d\u5316\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u4e00\u6b69"]}

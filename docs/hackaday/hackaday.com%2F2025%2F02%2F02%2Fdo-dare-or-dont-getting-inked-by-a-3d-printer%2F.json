And she gives out a warning, albeit at a good 10 minutes in, to not do this at home. What shes about to do takes creativity and tech obsession to the next level: to transform a 3D printer into a functional tattoo machine. Therefore, [Emily] ingeniously modified one of her standard 3D printers to operate two-dimensionally, swapped its plastic extruder for a tattoo gun, and, yes, even managed to persuade a willing participant to try it out.\nThe entire process can be seen in [Emily]s video below, which humorously yet meticulously documents the journey from Sharpie test runs to actually inking skin. Aside from a lot of tongue-in-cheek trial and error, this project requires a sheer amount of problem-solving. [Emily] employs firmware edits to bypass safety checks, and clever hardware adaptations to ensure smooth transitions between strokes. One impressive upgrade is the emergency solenoid system, a literal panic button to stop the machine mid-tattoo in case of trouble\u2014a critical addition for something with needles involved!\nThis hack sits on the edge of DIY body modification, raising eyebrows and technical questions alike. If you missed the warning and are now frantically searching for tattoo removal options, know weve covered some (but you might be rightfully scared of automating that, too, at this point). If you havent lifted a finger while reading this, just do the safe thing: watch [Emily]s video, and tinker about the subsequent purposes this discovery creates for 3D printing or tattoo art.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u6a5f\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- DIY\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\uff1a\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f34\u30463D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- \u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30af\u304b\u3089\u5b9f\u8df5\u3078\uff1a\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u6a5f\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30eb\u3068\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30bf\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

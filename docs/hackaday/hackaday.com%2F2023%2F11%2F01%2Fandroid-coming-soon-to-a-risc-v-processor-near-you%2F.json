If you had a MIPS Android phone you may have been in the minority, but Intel phones enjoyed some popularity, and the up-and-coming new kid in the world of Android is RISC-V. For anyone interested in this last architecture its worth looking at the Google Open Source blog, in which theyve published an overview of the current status of the project.\nIn short, its full steam ahead  as the development environment and emulation is in place for RISC-V Android. Its certain well start seeing RISC-V phones on the market soon, but perhaps thats not the part which should interest readers the most. Over the last decade we have seen an explosion of inexpensive ARM single board computers, and though some of them such as the Raspberry Pi owe their heritage to set-top-box SoCs, its fair to say that a strong driver for this trend has been the proliferation of powerful mobile chips. A take-up of RISC-V driven by Android would mean a similar explosion of powerful SoCs with those\u00a0 cores, leading we hope to much more accessible and powerful RISC-V computing. Sadly we expect them to still come with proprietary peripherals leading to plenty of closed source blobs, but we cant have everything.\nIf youd like to read more about the whole blob situation and RISC-V, weve got you covered.", "title": "\"ARM\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\uff01RISC-V\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAndroid\u306e\u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883\u3068\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u6574\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\"", "body": "Android\u304cRISC-V\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306aAndroid\u7aef\u672b\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\u3002ARM\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001RISC-V\u3082\u666e\u53ca\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306f\u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"ARM\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\uff01RISC-V\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAndroid\u306e\u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883\u3068\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u6574\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\"", "\"RISC-V Android\u306e\u73fe\u72b6\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac\uff01Google\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3057\u305f\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\"", "\"RISC-V\u306e\u53f0\u982d\uff01\u8fd1\u3044\u5c06\u6765\u3001\u5e02\u5834\u3067\u3088\u304f\u898b\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b\u3082\uff1f\"", "\"RISC-V\u3068\u306f\uff1fARM\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u306f\"", "\"\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u30c9\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u62b1\u3048\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u3001RISC-V\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u304c\u9032\u3080\uff01\""]}

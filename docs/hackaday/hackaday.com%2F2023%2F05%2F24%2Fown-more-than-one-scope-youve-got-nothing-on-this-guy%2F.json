But we are mere dilettantes, amateurs if you will, compared to [Volke Kloke]. Hes got 350 of them in his average American home, and we have to say, among them are some beauties.\nThe linked newspaper article is sometimes frustratingly light on the details, but fortunately he has a website all of his own where we can all get immersed in the details. Of particular interest is an instrument which doesnt even have a CRT, the General Radio 338 string oscillograph used a mirror drum to catch a standing wave in a tungsten wire, but there are plenty more. Is your first scope among them?\nAs we now live in the age of cheap digital scopes, at any surplus sale youll see plenty of CRT-based instruments going for relative pennies. Of those, the more recent and high-end ones are still extremely useful instruments, and its not just misty-eyed reminiscing to say that they remain a worthy addition to any bench.\nWant to know about early scope tech?

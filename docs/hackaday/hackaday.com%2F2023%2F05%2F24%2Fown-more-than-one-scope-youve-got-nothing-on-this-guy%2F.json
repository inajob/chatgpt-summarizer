But we are mere dilettantes, amateurs if you will, compared to [Volke Kloke]. Hes got 350 of them in his average American home, and we have to say, among them are some beauties.\nThe linked newspaper article is sometimes frustratingly light on the details, but fortunately he has a website all of his own where we can all get immersed in the details.

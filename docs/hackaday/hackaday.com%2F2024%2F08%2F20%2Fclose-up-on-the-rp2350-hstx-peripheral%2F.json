One of the new peripherals is HSTX, for which the description High speed serial port does not adequately describe how far it is from the humble UART which the name might suggest. CNX Software have taken a look at its capabilities, and its worth a read.\nWith a 150 MHz clock and 8 available pins, its a serial output with a combined bandwidth of 2400 Mbps, which immediately leaves all manner of potential for streamed outputs. On the RP2040 for example a DVI output was made using the PIO peripherals, while here the example code shows how to use these pins instead. Were guessing it will be exploited for all manner of pseudo-analogue awesomeness in the manner were used to with the I2S peripherals on the EP32. Of course, theres no corresponding input, but that still leaves plenty of potential.\nHave a quick read of our launch coverage of the RP2350, and the Pico 2 board its part of."}

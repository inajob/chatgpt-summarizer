Nor have they been particularly expandable in that regard. However, thats all beginning to change, with [Jeff Geerling] reporting success getting external GPUs to work on the Raspberry Pi 5.\nUnlike previous Raspberry Pis, the Raspberry Pi 5 has a less quirky implementation for its PCI Express bus. Previous editions have thrown up issues when trying to work with GPUs, but [Jeff] has found much more success this time around. Hes gotten an AMD RX 460 to work with the setup, and has got it running quite a bit of the glmark2 test regime. Hes working on a variety of other AMD cards too, but suspects NVidia parts could be harder due to some initialization issues that are proving difficult to quash.\nIt still takes some funky adapters and a lot of work, but finally GPUs are starting to work with the platform. Keep up with his list of card trials on the PiPCI website. Weve seen [Jeff]s work with earlier iterations of the Raspberry Pi before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi 5\u3067\u5916\u90e8GPU\u304c\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u308b", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u3067\u5916\u90e8GPU\u304c\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u7279\u5b9a\u306eAMD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u65e2\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001NVidia\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u793a\u5506\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3068\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306fPiPCI\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi 5\u3067\u5916\u90e8GPU\u304c\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306f\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u62e1\u5f35\u6027\u304c\u5411\u4e0a", "AMD\u306eRX 460\u304c\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3067\u306eGPU\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u958b\u304b\u308c\u308b"]}

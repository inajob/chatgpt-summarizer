Nor have they been particularly expandable in that regard. However, thats all beginning to change, with [Jeff Geerling] reporting success getting external GPUs to work on the Raspberry Pi 5.\nUnlike previous Raspberry Pis, the Raspberry Pi 5 has a less quirky implementation for its PCI Express bus. Previous editions have thrown up issues when trying to work with GPUs, but [Jeff] has found much more success this time around. Hes gotten an AMD RX 460 to work with the setup, and has got it running quite a bit of the glmark2 test regime. Hes working on a variety of other AMD cards too, but suspects NVidia parts could be harder due to some initialization issues that are proving difficult to quash.\nIt still takes some funky adapters and a lot of work, but finally GPUs are starting to work with the platform. Keep up with his list of card trials on the PiPCI website. Weve seen [Jeff]s work with earlier iterations of the Raspberry Pi before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

This comes not too long after Prusas Printables website had begun to purge all derived models to adhere to the no derivatives license. According to NTI, the removal of these derived models was not requested by NTI, but by a third-party report, unbeknownst to NTI or the original creator of the model. Recognizing its importance to the community, 3DBenchy can now be downloaded  modified freely.\nNTI worked together with the original creator [Daniel Nor\u00e9e] and former Creative Tools CEO [Paulo Kiefe] to transition 3DBenchy and the associated website to the public domain, with the latter two having control over the website and associated social media accounts. Hopefully this means that the purged models on Printables can be restored soon, even if some may prefer to print alternate (literal) benches.\nThe unfortunate part is that much of this mess began courtesy of the original 3DBenchy license being ignored. If that point had been addressed many years ago instead of being swept under the rug by all parties involved, there would have been no need for any of this kerfuffle.", "title": "3DBenchy\u304c\u30d1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\uff01\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u6539\u9020\u30fb\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "body": "3DBenchy\u304c\u516c\u5171\u306e\u9818\u57df\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u6539\u5909\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["3DBenchy\u304c\u30d1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\uff01\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u6539\u9020\u30fb\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "NTI\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u304c3DBenchy\u306e\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff1a\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3092\u518d\u78ba\u8a8d", "3DBenchy\u95a2\u9023\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u524a\u9664\u554f\u984c\u3001\u5143\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u4ecb\u5165", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff013DBenchy\u3092\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u4f7f\u304a\u3046", "\u4e0d\u904b\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u554f\u984c\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u30013DBenchy\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6642\u4ee3\u3078"]}

Others hate them. We certainly do like to see just how far people can push the browser and version 0.6 of CHILI3D, a browser-based CAD program, certainly pushes.\nIf you click the link, you might want to find the top right corner to change the language (although a few messages stubbornly refuse to use English). From there, click New Document and youll see an impressive slate of features in the menus and toolbars.\nThe export button is one of those stubborn features. If you draw something and select export, youll see a dialog in Chinese. Translated it has the title: Select and a checkmark for Determined and a red X for Cancelled. If you select some things in the drawing and click the green checkmark, it will export a brep file. That file format is common with CAD programs, but youll need to convert, probably, if you want to 3D print your design.\nThe projects GitHub repository shows an impressive slate of features, but also notes that things are changing as this is alpha software. The CAD kernel is a common one brought in via WebAssembly, so there shouldnt be many simple bugs involving geometry.\nWeve seen a number of browser-based tools that do some kind of CAD. CADmium is a recent entry into the list. Or, stick with OpenSCAD. We sometimes go low-tech for schematics."}

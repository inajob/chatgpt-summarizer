[3DSage] has a working breadboard computer that is as simple as it can possibly be, putting it together piece by piece to show exactly whats needed to get a computer which can count, access memory, and even perform basic mathematical operations.\nThe first step for any computer is to build a clock, and in this case its being provided by a 555 timer which is configured to provide an adjustable time standard and which steps through the clock pulses when a button is pressed. The next piece is a four-bit counter and a memory chip, which lets the computer read and write data. A set of DIP switches allows a user to write data to memory, and by using the last three bits of the data as opcodes, the computer can reset, halt, and jump to various points in a simple program.\nAlthough these three chips make it possible to perform basic programming, [3DSage] takes this a bit further in his video by demonstrating some other simple programs, such as one which can play music or behave as an alarm clock. He also shows how to use a fourth chip in the form of a binary adder to perform some basic math, and then packages it all into a retro-styled computer kit. Of course you can take these principles and build them out as far as they will go, like this full 8-bit computer built on a breadboard or even this breadboard computer that hosts a 486.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5236\u4f5c\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u56de\u8def\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- \u5358\u7d14\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u69cb\u6210", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

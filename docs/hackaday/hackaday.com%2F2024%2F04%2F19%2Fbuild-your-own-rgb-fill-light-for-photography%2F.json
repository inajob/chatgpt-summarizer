As any experienced photographer will tell you, getting the right lighting is key to getting a good shot. To help in that regard, you might like to have a fill light. If you follow [tobychui]s example, you can build your own!\nColors!\nThe build relies on addressable WS2812B LEDs as the core of the design. While theyre not necessarily the fanciest LEDs for balanced light output, they are RGB LEDs, so they can put out a ton of different colors for different stylistic effects. The LEDs are under the command of a Wemos D1, which provides a WiFI connection for wireless control of the light.\n[tobychui] did a nice job of building a PCB for the project, including heatsinking to keep the array of 49 LEDs nice and cool. The whole assembly is all put together inside a 3D printed housing to keep it neat and tidy. Control is either via onboard buttons or over the WiFi connection.\nFiles are on GitHub if youre seeking inspiration or want to duplicate the build for yourself. Weve seen some other similar builds before, too. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own rad photography hacks, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

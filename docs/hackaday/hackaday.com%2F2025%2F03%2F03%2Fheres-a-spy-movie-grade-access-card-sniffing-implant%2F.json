For instance, how about a small board you plant behind an RFID reader, collecting access card data and then replaying it when you next walk up the door? [Jakub Kramarz] brings us perhaps the best design on the DIY market, called The Tick  simple, flexible, cheap, tiny, and fully open-source.\nTake off the reader, tap into the relevant wires and power pins (up to 25V input), and just leave the board there. It can do BLE or WiFi  over WiFi, you get a nice web UI showing you the data collected so far, and letting you send arbitrary data. It can do Wiegand like quite a few open-source projects, but it can also do arbitrary clock+data protocols, plus you can just wire it up quickly, and it will figure out the encoding.\nWe could imagine such a board inside a Cyberpunk DnD rulebook or used in Mr Robot as a plot point, except that this one is real and you can use it today for red teaming and security purposes. Not to say all applications would be NSA-catalog-adjacent pentesting  you could use such a bug to reverse-engineer your own garage door opener, for one.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cThe Tick\u300d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRFID\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cThe Tick\u300d\u306f\u3001RFID\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u7528\u9014\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cThe Tick\u300d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRFID\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u7528\u9014\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u7d39\u4ecb", "- BLE\u3068WiFi\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u67d4\u8edf\u306aDIY\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u98a8\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u6027", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u306e\u9006\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

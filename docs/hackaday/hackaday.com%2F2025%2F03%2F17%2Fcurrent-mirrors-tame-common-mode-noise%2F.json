[Kevin]s video on this topic explores boosting common mode rejection by swapping out the old-school tail resistor for a current mirror. Yes, the humble current mirror  long underestimated in DIY analog circles  steps up here, giving his differential amplifier a much-needed backbone.\nSo why does this matter? Well, in Kevins bench tests, this hack more than doubles the common mode rejection, leaping from a decent 35 dB to a noise-crushing 93 dB. Thats not just tweaking for tweakings sake; thats taking a breadboard standard and making it ready for sensitive, low-level signal work. Instead of wrestling with mismatched transistors or praying to the gods of temperature stability, he opts for a practical approach. A couple of matched NPNs, a pair of emitter resistors, and a back-of-the-envelope resistor calculation  and boom, clean differential gain without the common mode muck.\nIf you want the nitty-gritty details, schematics of the demo circuits are on his project GitHub. Kevins explanation is equal parts history lesson and practical engineering, and its worth the watch. Keep tinkering, and do share your thoughts on this.\n\n"}

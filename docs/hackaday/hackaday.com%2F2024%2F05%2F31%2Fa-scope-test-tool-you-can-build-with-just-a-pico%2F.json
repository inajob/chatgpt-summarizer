What if you buy a new scope and need a quick way to test it lest one of its channels its broken, like [Paul Wasserman] had happen to him? Now you only need a Pi Pico and a few extra components to make a scope test board with a large variety of signals it can output, thanks to [Paul]s Sig Gen Pi Pico firmware.\nDespite the name its not a signal generator as we know it, as its not flexible in the signals it generates. Instead, it creates a dozen signals at more or less the same time  from square waves of various frequencies and duty cycles, to a PWM-driven DAC driving eight different waveforms, to Manchester-encoded data I2C/SPI/UART transfers for all your protocol decoder testing.\nEverything is open source under the BSD 3-Clause license, and theres even two PDFs with documentation and a user manual, not to mention the waveform screenshots for your own reference.\nIts seriously impressive how many features [Paul] has fit into a single firmware. Thanks to his work, whenever you have some test equipment in need of being tested, just grab your Pico and a few passive components."}

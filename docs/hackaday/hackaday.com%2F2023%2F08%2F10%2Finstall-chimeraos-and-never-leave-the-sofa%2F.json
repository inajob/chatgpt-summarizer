ChimeraOS appears to be one of those. The idea is that if you own a gaming PC, but it is not necessarily located where you want to be all the time (like in a gaming den or office for example) then ChimeraOS allows you to play games on it remotely via a local machine. That machine may be a media PC attached to your main TV, or perhaps a mobile device like a steam deck.\nWith support for AMD GPUs only, there is one issue with deployment \u2014 if youre an Nvidia owner youre out of luck \u2014 the premise is to be able to boot up into a gaming-friendly environment with minimal fuss. Hook up a controller and youre good to go. Support is also there for a few mobile devices, specifically some Aokzoe, Aya Neo, and OneXPlayer devices as well as some preliminary support for the Asus ROG Ally not to mention the Steam Deck as we touched on earlier. From a software perspective, it obviously supports the Steam platform but also Epic Games, Good Old Games (GOG), and tentatively a mention of console platforms. Sadly the website doesnt mention much detail on that last bit, but there are some tantalizing hints in the projects Twitter/X/whatever feed. Reading the release notes, there are mentions of PCSX2 (Playstation 2) Super Game Boy and Atari platforms, so digging into the GitHub repo might be instructive, or you know, actually installing it and trying. This scribe doesnt own an AMD GPU so that isnt an option, but do drop us a line in the comments if youve tried it and how it works for you.\nMany of us at Hackday are avid gamers, especially of the retro kind, which is why we really like these projects. Heres a nice game controller you can print yourself. For self-builds, theres nothing quite like the satisfaction of a DIY arcade machine, but what if you think outside the box?"}

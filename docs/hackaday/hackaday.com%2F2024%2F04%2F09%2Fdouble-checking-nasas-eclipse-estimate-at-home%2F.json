But you know whats even better than making memories? Having cold hard data to back it up.\nHackaday contributor [Bob Baddeley] was in Madison, Wisconsin for the big event, which NASAs Eclipse Explorer website predicted would see about 87% coverage. Watching the eclipse through the appropriate gear at the local hackerspace was fun, but the real nerding out happened when he got home and could pull the data from his solar system.\nA graph of the systems generated power shows a very clear dip during the duration of the eclipse, which let him determine exactly when the occlusion started, peaked, and ended.\n\nWhats more, by comparing the output of the panels at their lowest with the pre-eclipse peak, [Bob] was able to calculate that the light falling on them dropped by roughly 87 to 90%  right where NASA pegged it. Similarly, the timing of the eclipse as experienced by his solar system lined up within a few minutes of what the website predicted.\n\nThat the worlds leading space agency was able to properly model one of the biggest celestial events in recent memory is perhaps not overly surprising. Thats part of what were paying them for, honestly. But its always good to run a second set of eyes over the numbers.", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u65e5\u98df\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d", "body": "\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u65e5\u98df\u306f\u8a18\u61b6\u306b\u6b8b\u308b\u666f\u8272\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30de\u30c7\u30a3\u30bd\u30f3\u306eNASA\u65e5\u98df\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e88\u6e2c\u3082\u6b63\u78ba\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u304c\u65e5\u98df\u306e\u6642\u9593\u5e2f\u306e\u660e\u78ba\u306a\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3092\u793a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u65e5\u98df\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d", "\u65e5\u98df\u306e\u969b\u306b\u767a\u96fb\u91cf\u304c\u6025\u6e1b\uff1a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u89e3\u6790\u3067\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b", "NASA\u306e\u4e88\u6e2c\u3068\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u65e5\u98df\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u8a18\u9332", "\u518d\u73fe\u6027\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u65e5\u98df\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\uff1a\u65e5\u98df\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u89e3\u91c8"]}

The latest project around it is a 6K camera. Of course, the sensor gives you a lot of it, but it also requires some off-the-shelf parts and, of course, some 3D printed components.\nAn off-the-shelf part of a case provides a reliable C mount. Theres also an IR filter in a 3D-printed bracket.\n\nThe processor gets hot, so he used different heat sinks and a fan, too. Overall, this isnt much custom electronics, but this is an excellent example of assembling existing parts with high-quality 3D printed components.\nHeat-set inserts provide a tripon mount. Theres also a custom HDMI monitor mount if you dont want to use your phone as a viewfinder. One neat oddity that helps is a USB-A cable that splits into three USB-C connectors. Of course, only one of them has data lines. The other two feed power to different parts of the camera.\nA good-looking build. At a glance, you could easily think this was a commercial product. We do like these digital camera builds, but we also find 3D printed film cameras fascinating. If 6K is too much for you, you can always downsize.\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff016K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "body": "\u753b\u50cf\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f6K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u65e2\u5b58\u90e8\u54c1\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u69cb\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff016K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "\u5e02\u8ca9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c6K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u88fd\u4f5c\u8a18", "\u71b1\u5bfe\u7b56\u3082\u4e07\u5168\uff01\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u4f8b", "6K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u8a2d\u8a08\uff1aUSB-A\u304b\u3089USB-C\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db\u6280\u8853", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

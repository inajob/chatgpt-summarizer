Whether theyre sweeping your floors, delivering a snack, building a car, or even driving one, robots are everywhere on this planet. And since over 70% of this planet is covered in water, it makes sense that robots should be there, too. Getting a robot to work underwater at all is one thing, but getting it to work underwater reliably can be quite a challenge. Water always finds a way to ruin your day, after all, and this reality only worsens when you add a little salt into the mix.\nTony White knows the marine engineering field well, having worked in the space for over a decade. Hes currently an applications engineer at Blue Robotics, where hes worked on everything from full-size autonomous surface vessels to underwater swarm robots. Hes stopping by the Hack Chat to talk about the harsh engineering realities of underwater automation, so if youve ever wanted to take the plunge, youll want to come to this Hack Chat for sure.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, February 5 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.\n"}

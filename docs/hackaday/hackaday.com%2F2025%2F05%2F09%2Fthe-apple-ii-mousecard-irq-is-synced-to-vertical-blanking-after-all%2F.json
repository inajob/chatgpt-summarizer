This issue could not be reproduced on real (PAL or NTSC) hardware. The answer all comes down to how the card synchronizes with the systems vertical blanking (VBL) while drawing to the screen.\nThe Apple II MouseCard is one of the many peripheral cards produced for the system, originally bundled with a version of MacPaint for the Apple II. While not a super popular card at the time, it nevertheless got used by other software despite this Apple system still being based around a command line interface.\nAccording to the cards documentation the interrupt call (IRQ) can be set to 50 or 60 Hz to match the local standard. Confusingly, certain knowledgeable people told him that the card could not be synced to the VBL as it had no knowledge of this. As covered in the article and associated MAME issue ticket, it turns out that the card is very much synced with the VBL exactly as described in The Friendly Manual, with the cards firmware being run by the systems CPU, which informs the card of synchronization events.", "title": "Apple II MouseCard\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "body": "Colin Leroy-Mira\u304cApple II\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u306eMouseCard\u306e\u3061\u3089\u3064\u304d\u3092\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u305f\u3002VBL\u3068\u306e\u540c\u671f\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Apple II MouseCard\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "MAME\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bApple II MouseCard\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c", "Apple II MouseCard\u306e\u5782\u76f4\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u540c\u671f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "Apple II\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eMouseCard\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "Apple II MouseCard\u306eIRQ\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068VBL\u540c\u671f\u306e\u771f\u5b9f"]}

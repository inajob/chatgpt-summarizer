Make that animation interactive, and well, we dont know how many words it is worth, but it is plenty! Thats the idea behind [Bartosz Ciechanowskis] blog where he uses clever interactive animations to explain the surprisingly complex physics of riding a bicycle.\nThe first animation lets you view a rider from any angle and control the riders pose. Later ones show you how forces act on the rider and bicycle, starting with example wooden boxes and working back up to the original bike rider with force vectors visible. As you move the rider or the bike, the arrows show you the direction and magnitude of force.\n\nYou eventually graduate to close-ups of the tires, the handlebars, and the sprocket. These kinds of animations are to physics what an oscilloscope is to electronics. You dont have to have a scope to understand electronics, but it sure does help.\nOnce you are done with the bike  and thats going to take some time  click on Archives and see similar posts on mechanical watches, GPS, internal combustion engines, and more. Really great stuff.\nThere was a time when beautiful educational animations were very expensive to create. They are easier now, but we still dont see them as often as wed like for topics like Fourier transforms.", "title": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u7269\u7406\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u7269\u7406\u3092\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u304f\u8aac\u660e\u3059\u308b\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u59ff\u52e2\u3084\u529b\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3001\u30bf\u30a4\u30e4\u3084\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u3001\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u62e1\u5927\u8868\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u540c\u69d8\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u7269\u7406\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u89e3\u8aac", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3068\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u529b\u5b66", "\u5148\u9032\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac", "\u96e3\u89e3\u306a\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u7269\u7406\u3092\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a", "\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308bGPS\u3084\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u7b49\u306e\u904b\u52d5\u5b66"]}

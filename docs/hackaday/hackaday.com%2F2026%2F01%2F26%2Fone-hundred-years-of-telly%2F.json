In a room above what is today a rather famous Italian coffee shop in Londons Soho, he had assembled a complete mechanical TV system that he demonstrated to journalists.\nTelevision is one of those inventions that owes its genesis to more than a single person, so while Baird was by no means the only one inventing in the field, he was the first to demonstrate a working system. With mechanical scanning and just 30 lines, its hardly HD or 4K, but it does have the advantage of being within the reach of the constructor.\nPerhaps the saddest thing about Baird and his system is that while he was able to attract the interest of the BBC in it, when the time came for dedicated transmissions at a higher resolution, his by then partly mechanical system could not compete and he faded into relative obscurity. Brits instead received EMIs 405 line system, which persisted until the very start of the 1980s, and eventually the German PAL colour system in the late 1960s.\nSo head on down to Bar Italia if you can to raise a coffee to his memory, and should you wish to have a go at Baird-style TV for yourself, then you may need to print yourself a disk.\nHeader image: Matt Brown, CC BY 2.0."}

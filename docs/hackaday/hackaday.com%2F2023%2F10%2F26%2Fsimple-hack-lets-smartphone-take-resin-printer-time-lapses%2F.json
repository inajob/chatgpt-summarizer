They may not be able to fully replace your trusty old FDM printer, but for certain jobs, they just cant be beaten. Sadly though, creating those smooth time-lapse videos of your prints isnt quite as easy to do as it is on their filament-based counterparts.\nNot as easy, perhaps, but not impossible. [Fraens] found a way to make time-lapses on any resin printer, and in a wonderfully hacky way. First, you need to find a smartphone, which shouldnt be too hard, given how often we all tend to upgrade. [Fraens] recommends replacing the standard camera app on the phone with Open Camera, to prevent it from closing during the long intervals with nothing happening. The camera is triggered by any readily available Bluetooth dongle, which is connected via a simple transistor circuit to an Arduino output. To trigger the shutter, a light-dependent resistor (LDR) is connected to one of the microcontrollers inputs. The LDR is placed inside the bed of the resin printer  an Anycubic Photon in this case  where light from the UV panel used to cross-link the resin can fall on it. A simple bit of Arduino code triggers the Bluetooth dongle at the right moment, capturing a series of stills which are later stitched together using DaVinci Resolve.\nThe short video below shows the results, which look pretty good to us. There are other ways to do this, of course, but we find the simplicity of this method pleasing.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3046\u304c\u3001\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u5b89\u304f\u306a\u308b\u5149\u9020\u5f62\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3068\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u300d", "\u300c\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u7dba\u9e97\u306b\u64ae\u5f71\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30c0\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u30fb\u30ea\u30be\u30eb\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30c1\u30eb\u5199\u771f\u3092\u7e4b\u3052\u3066\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u300d"]}

Those endless fields of cropland waving in the breeze have been the theatre for an unlikely battle over right to repair, the result of which should affect us all. The case of FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, STATE OF ILLINOIS, and STATE OF MINNESOTA, v. DEERE  COMPANY \u00a0relates to the machinery manufacturers use of DRM to restrict the repair of its products, and holds the promise to end the practice once and for all.\nThis is being written in Europe, where were an average person asked to name a brand that says America, they might reach for the familiar; perhaps Disney, McDonalds, or Coca-Cola. These are the flag-bearers of American culture for outsiders, but its fair to say that none of them can claim to have built the country. The green and yellow Deere tractors on the other hand represent the current face of a company with nearly two hundred years of farming history, which by virtue of producing some of the first mass-produced plows, had perhaps the greatest individual role in shaping modern American agriculture and thus indirectly the country itself. To say that Deere is woven into the culture of rural America is something of an understatement, agricultural brands like Deere have an enviable customer base, the most loyal of any industry.\nThus while those green and yellow tractors are far from the only case of DRM protected repairability, they have become the symbolic poster child for the issue as a whole. Its important to understand then how far-reaching it is beyond the concerns of us technology and open-source enthusiasts, and into something much more fundamental.\nThe text of the lawsuit itself can be readily downloaded as a PDF, and from our non-lawyerly pass it seems that at its heart lies the manufacturers monopolistic practices by restricting access to software diagnostic and repair tools, rather than the use of DRM itself. Thus should the suit not go Deeres way, as we read it it wouldnt undermine the DMCA or the use of DRM, but it would lessen the attractiveness of DRM to a manufacturer by removing their ability to restrict repairers whether they use DRM or not. This would propagate out beyond the farm, and have a consequent effect on the repairability of much more than tractors.\nThis lawsuit is the latest of many targeting the same issue, and despite having the FTC behind it were not certain of its chances of success in the current climate. We hope that decades of these practices causing a modern Deere to be worth considerably less than an old one will inflict enough damage on the brand for its competitors to take note. There was a time when buying a Deere such as the one your scribe piloted over the fields of Oxfordshire years ago was the Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM of agricultural machinery, while now theres a seed of doubt as to whether a minor breakdown could cause a lost harvest. Thats not an enviable position for any brand to find itself in, especially by its own hand."}

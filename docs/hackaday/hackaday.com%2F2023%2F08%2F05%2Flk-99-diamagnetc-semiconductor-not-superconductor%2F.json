EM drives and cold fusion for example would be the coolest of the cool if they worked, but sadly they crumbled when subjected to scientific inquiry outside the labs of their originators. The jurys still out on the latest example, a claimed room-temperature superconductor, but its starting to seem that it might instead be a diamagnetic semiconductor.\nWe covered some of the story surrounding the announcement of LK-99 and subsequent reports of it levitating under magnetic fields, but todays installment comes courtesy of a team from Beihang University in Beijing. Theyve published a paper in which they characterize their sample of LK-99, and sadly according to them its no superconductor.\nInstead its a diamagnetic semiconductor, something that in itself probably bears some explanation. Were guessing most readers will be familiar with semiconductors, but diamagnetic substances possess the property of having an external magnetic field induce an internal magnetic field in the opposite direction. This means that they will levitate in a magnetic field, but not due to the Meissner effect, the property of superconductors which causes magnetic field to flow round their outside. The Beijing team have shown by measuring the resistance of the sample that its not a superconductor.\nSo sadly it seems LK-99 isnt the miracle it was billed as, unless theres some special quirk in the production of the original Korean sample which didnt make it to the other teams. We cant help wondering why a sample from Korea wasnt subjected to external evaluation rather than leaving the other teams to make their own.

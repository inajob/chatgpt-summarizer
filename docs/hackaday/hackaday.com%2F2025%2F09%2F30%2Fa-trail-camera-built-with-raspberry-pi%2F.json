However, this is a task you can readily automate, as [Luke] did with his DIY trail camera.\nA Raspberry Pi Zero 2W serves as the heart of the build. Its compact and runs on very little power, but also provides a good amount more processing power than the original Raspberry Pi Zero. Its kitted out with the Raspberry Pi AI Camera, which uses the Sony IMX500 Intelligent Vision Sensor  providing a great platform for neural networks doing image classification and similar machine learning tasks. A Witty Pi power management module is used both for its real time clock and to schedule start-ups and shutdowns to best manage the power on offer from the batteries. All these components are wrapped up in a 3D printed housing to keep the Pi safe out in the wild.\nWeve seen some neat projects in this vein before.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u91ce\u751f\u52d5\u7269\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u64ae\u5f71", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u64ae\u5f71\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u91ce\u751f\u52d5\u7269\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u64ae\u5f71", "- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- AI\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3059\u308bWitty Pi\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30cf\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0"]}

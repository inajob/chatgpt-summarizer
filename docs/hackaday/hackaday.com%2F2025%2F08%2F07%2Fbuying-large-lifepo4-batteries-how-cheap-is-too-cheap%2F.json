That said, as with any market that is full of people who are hunting for that great deal, there are also many shady sellers who will happily sell you a product that could be very dangerous. Especially in the case of large LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries, considering the sheer amount of energy they can contain. Recently [Will Prowse] nabbed such a $125, 100 Ah battery off Amazon that carries no recognizable manufacturer or brand name.\nCheap and cheerful, and probably wont burn down the place. (Credit: Will Prowse, YouTube)\nIf this battery works well, it could be an amazing deal for off-grid and solar-powered applications. Running a battery of tests on the battery, [Will] found that the units BMS featured no over-current protection, happily surging to 400 A, with only over-temperature protection keeping it from melting down during a discharge scenario. Interestingly, under-temperature charge protection also worked on the unit.\nAfter a (safe) teardown of the battery the real discoveries began, with a row of missing cells, the other cells being re-sleeved and thus likely salvaged or rejects. Fascinatingly, another YouTuber did a similar test and found that their (even cheaper) unit was of a much lower capacity (88.9 Ah) than [Will]s with 98 Ah and featured a completely different BMS to boot. Their unit did however feature something of a brand name, though its much more likely that these are all just generic LFP batteries that get re-branded by resellers.\nWhat this means is that these LFP batteries may be cheap, but they come with cells that are likely to be of questionable quality, featuring a BMS that plays it fast and loose with safety. Although [Will] doesnt outright say that you shouldnt use these batteries, he does recommend that you install a fuse on it to provide some semblance of over-current protection. Keeping a fire extinguisher at hand might also be a good idea.\n\n", "title": "\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u88cf\u5074\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u5371\u967a\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u54c1\u8cea\u304c\u7591\u308f\u3057\u3044\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u88cf\u5074\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aLFP\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "\u8ab0\u3067\u3082\u8cb7\u3048\u308b\uff1f\u54c1\u8cea\u304c\u4e0d\u660e\u306a100Ah\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u30ea\u30f3\u9178\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b89\u3044\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\uff1a\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\uff1a\u54c1\u8cea\u3068\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

That said, as with any market that is full of people who are hunting for that great deal, there are also many shady sellers who will happily sell you a product that could be very dangerous. Especially in the case of large LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries, considering the sheer amount of energy they can contain. Recently [Will Prowse] nabbed such a $125, 100 Ah battery off Amazon that carries no recognizable manufacturer or brand name.\nCheap and cheerful, and probably wont burn down the place. (Credit: Will Prowse, YouTube)\nIf this battery works well, it could be an amazing deal for off-grid and solar-powered applications. Running a battery of tests on the battery, [Will] found that the units BMS featured no over-current protection, happily surging to 400 A, with only over-temperature protection keeping it from melting down during a discharge scenario. Interestingly, under-temperature charge protection also worked on the unit.\nAfter a (safe) teardown of the battery the real discoveries began, with a row of missing cells, the other cells being re-sleeved and thus likely salvaged or rejects. Fascinatingly, another YouTuber did a similar test and found that their (even cheaper) unit was of a much lower capacity (88.9 Ah) than [Will]s with 98 Ah and featured a completely different BMS to boot. Their unit did however feature something of a brand name, though its much more likely that these are all just generic LFP batteries that get re-branded by resellers.\nWhat this means is that these LFP batteries may be cheap, but they come with cells that are likely to be of questionable quality, featuring a BMS that plays it fast and loose with safety. Although [Will] doesnt outright say that you shouldnt use these batteries, he does recommend that you install a fuse on it to provide some semblance of over-current protection. Keeping a fire extinguisher at hand might also be a good idea.\n\n"}

In that presentation (see the video below), [Nathan Butts] covers everything from why you should take up the hobby, how to set up a software defined radio (SDR) receiver, and how to repurpose old computers. This is just one of a series of videos recently posted from the conference  check out their channel to see them all.\nUnlike optical astronomy, you can listen to the universe by radio during the day or night, rain or shine. You dont need a dark sky, although these days, a quiet radio location might be hard to find. [Nathan] also points out that some people just want to crunch data collected by others, and thats fun, too. There are many ways to get involved from designing hardware, writing software, or  of course  just listening.\nIt has never been easier to get involved. Cheap software-defined radios are perfect for this sort of work, and we all have massive computers and scores of small data-collection computers. Maybe youll be the next person to hear a Wow signal. If you are worried about fielding an antenna, many people repurpose satellite dishes.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5929\u6587\u5b66: \u30d3\u30ae\u30ca\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3067\u3001\u653e\u9001\u3092\u805e\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084SDR\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u8a2d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u96e8\u3084\u591c\u9593\u3001\u660e\u308b\u3044\u5834\u6240\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u4ed6\u8005\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u51e6\u7406\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306eSDR\u306f\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5929\u6587\u5b66: \u30d3\u30ae\u30ca\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u8a2d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u89e3\u6790\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u3082\u96fb\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u30ea\u30b0\u3067\u96fb\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66", "\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u65b9\u306e\u5909\u308f\u308b\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528"]}

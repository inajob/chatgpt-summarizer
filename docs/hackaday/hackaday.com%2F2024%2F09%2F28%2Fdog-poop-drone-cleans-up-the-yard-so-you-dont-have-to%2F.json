So when we saw this aerial dog poop removal system show up in the tips line, we knew it had to be the work of [Caleb Olson].\nIf youre unfamiliar with [Caleb]s oeuvre, let us refresh your memory. [Caleb] has been on a bit of a dog poop journey, starting with a machine-learning system that analyzed security camera footage to detect when the adorable [Twinkie] dropped a deuce in the yard. Not content with just knowing when a poop event has occurred, he automated the task of locating the packages with a poop-pointing robot laser. Removal of the poop remained a manual task, one which [Caleb] was keen to outsource, hence the current work.\nThe video below, from a lightning talk at a conference, is pretty much all we have to go on, and the quality is a bit potato-esque. And while [Caleb]s PoopCopter is clearly still a prototype, its easy to get the gist. Combining data from the previous poop-adjacent efforts, [Caleb] has built a quadcopter that can (or will, someday) be guided to the approximate location of the offending package, home in on it using a downward-looking camera, and autonomously whisk it away.\nThe retrieval mechanism is the high point for us; rather than a complicated, servo-laden sky scoop or something similar, the drone has a bell-shaped container on its belly with a series of geared leaves on the open end. The leaves are open when the drone descends onto the payload, and then close as the drone does a quick rotation around the yaw axis. And, as [Caleb] gleefully notes, the leaves can also open in midair with a high-torque yaw move in the opposite direction; the potential for neighborly hijinx is staggering.\nAll jokes and puns aside, this looks fantastic, and we cant wait for more information and a better video. And lest you think [Caleb] only works on Number Two problems, never fear  hes also put considerable work into automating his offspring and taking the awkwardness out of social interactions.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u72ac\u306e\u7cde\u56de\u53ce\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u958b\u767a\u300d", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u306eCaleb Olson\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u72ac\u30a6\u30f3\u30c1\u9664\u53bb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002\u6620\u50cf\u304c\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u30a6\u30f3\u30c1\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u30fb\u9664\u53bb\u3002\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u56de\u53ce\u6a5f\u69cb\u3042\u308a\u3002\u4e8b\u524d\u306e\u52aa\u529b\u304b\u3089\u72ec\u7acb\u98db\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u5f85\u3061\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u72ac\u306e\u7cde\u56de\u53ce\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u958b\u767a\u300d", "\u300c\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7cde\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u56de\u53ce\u300d", "\u300c\u72ac\u306e\u7cde\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a\u300d", "\u300c\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ac\u306e\u7cde\u56de\u53ce\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d", "\u300c\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u72ac\u306e\u7cde\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d"]}

So when we saw this aerial dog poop removal system show up in the tips line, we knew it had to be the work of [Caleb Olson].\nIf youre unfamiliar with [Caleb]s oeuvre, let us refresh your memory. [Caleb] has been on a bit of a dog poop journey, starting with a machine-learning system that analyzed security camera footage to detect when the adorable [Twinkie] dropped a deuce in the yard. Not content with just knowing when a poop event has occurred, he automated the task of locating the packages with a poop-pointing robot laser. Removal of the poop remained a manual task, one which [Caleb] was keen to outsource, hence the current work.\nThe video below, from a lightning talk at a conference, is pretty much all we have to go on, and the quality is a bit potato-esque. And while [Caleb]s PoopCopter is clearly still a prototype, its easy to get the gist. Combining data from the previous poop-adjacent efforts, [Caleb] has built a quadcopter that can (or will, someday) be guided to the approximate location of the offending package, home in on it using a downward-looking camera, and autonomously whisk it away.\nThe retrieval mechanism is the high point for us; rather than a complicated, servo-laden sky scoop or something similar, the drone has a bell-shaped container on its belly with a series of geared leaves on the open end. The leaves are open when the drone descends onto the payload, and then close as the drone does a quick rotation around the yaw axis. And, as [Caleb] gleefully notes, the leaves can also open in midair with a high-torque yaw move in the opposite direction; the potential for neighborly hijinx is staggering.\nAll jokes and puns aside, this looks fantastic, and we cant wait for more information and a better video. And lest you think [Caleb] only works on Number Two problems, never fear  hes also put considerable work into automating his offspring and taking the awkwardness out of social interactions.\n\n"}

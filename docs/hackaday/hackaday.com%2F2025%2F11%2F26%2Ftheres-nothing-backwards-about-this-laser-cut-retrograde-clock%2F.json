If youve never heard of a biretrograde clock, well, we hadnt either. This is clearly a form of retrograde clock, which unlike the name implies doesnt spin backwards but oscillates in its motion the hands go retrograde the same way the planets do.\nThe oscillating movement is achieved via a pair of cams mounted on the hour and minute shafts of a common clock mechanism. As the shafts (and thus cams) turn, the minute and hour arms are raised and drop. While that could itself be enough to tell the time, [Paul] goes one further and has the actual hands on pivots driven by a gear mechanism on the cam-controlled arms. You might think that that extra reversal is what makes this a biretrograde clock but in the clockmakers world thats just saying its a retrograde clock with two indicators: in this case, minute and second.\nIts a fairly rare way to make a clock, but weve seen one before. That older project was 3D printed, which might be more your speed; if you prefer laser-cutting, though, [Paul]s Instructable includes SVG files. Alternatively, you could take a different approach and use voltmeters to get the same effect."}

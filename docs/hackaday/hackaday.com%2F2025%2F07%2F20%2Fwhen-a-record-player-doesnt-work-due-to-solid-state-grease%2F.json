Unfortunately, the 1972-era ITT KP821 record player that [Mark] got recently handed by a friend wasnt doing a lot of moving, with every part of the mechanism seemingly frozen in place, though the current owner wasnt certain that they were doing something wrong.\nMore after the break\n\nFortunately, this record player was in exceptionally good condition.. The primary failure was that the BSR record player mechanism, with its many touching metal surfaces, was suffering from a bad case of solidified grease. Although this is easily fixed with some IPA and a lot of elbow grease, the biggest trick with these mechanisms is putting it back together after cleaning, with many seemingly randomly shaped parts and every single E-clip that the manufacturer could design for and source at the time.\nWith that complete, this just left some pot cleaning and replacing a busted fuse in the amplifier section. The selenium rectifier was still functional, as were the SGS TAA621AX1 audio amplifier ICs. Despite the age of this portable record player, both its BSR mechanism and the twin speakers that are part of the record player are in remarkably good condition. Much like with a car, it seems that you just have to swap out the liquid-y elements before they turn into a solid.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- 1972\u5e74\u88fdITT KP821\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "1972\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u56fa\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u305a\u3002\u6e05\u6383\u5f8c\u306b\u518d\u7d44\u7acb\u3066\u3057\u3001\u6545\u969c\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 1972\u5e74\u88fdITT KP821\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u56fa\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u9664\u304f\uff1a\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u751f\u5fa9\u6d3b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u304c\u30ab\u30ae\uff01\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u4fee\u7406", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\uff1a\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9"]}

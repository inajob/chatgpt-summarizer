Apparently, these old computers were not pleasant to work on. The cables were not keyed and were prone to short against things. Screws easily strip out plastic holes. Of course, there wouldnt be a story if there wasnt a teardown and an upgrade that you can check out in the post.\nThe Stacy was one of Ataris earliest portable systems and the first ST portable (that is, STacy). Theres a backlit LCD, a keyboard and trackball, and the usual ports. You could make do with a single floppy or spring for a second floppy or an internal SCSI hard drive. The 8 MHz 68000-based machine would set you back north of $2,300 back in 1989.\nThe original plan was to run the thing on C-cell batteries, but that would give you about 15 minutes of operation. They finally decided it was a luggable  youd have to plug it into the wall. The battery compartment was there, but empty and glued shut.\nApparently, there were about 35,000 of these made, but they seem somewhat rare. But we do like a rare retrocomputer. Or even some that arent so rare."}

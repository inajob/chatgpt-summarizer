Involving some IR LEDs, perhaps a bit of LEGO, and plenty of trial-and-error, it was fun on a tiny scale. Now imagine that\u2014but rideable. That\u2019s exactly what [Austin Blake] did, scaling up a classroom robotics staple into a full-size vehicle you can actually sit on.\nThe robot uses a whopping 32 IR sensors to follow a black line across a concrete workshop floor, adjusting its path using a steering motor salvaged from a power wheelchair. An Arduino Mega Pro Mini handles the logic, sending PWM signals to a DIY servo. The chassis consists of a modified Crazy Cart, selected for its absurdly tight turning radius. With each prototype iteration, [Blake] improved sensor precision and motor control, turning a bumpy ride into a smooth glide.\nThe IR sensor array, which on the palm-sized vehicle consisted of just a handful of components, evolved into a PCB-backed bar nearly 0.5 meters wide. Potentiometer tuning was a fiddly affair, but worth it. Crashes? Sure. But the kind that makes you grin like your teenage self. If it looks like fun, you could either build one yourself, or upgrade a similar LEGO project.\n\n", "title": "- \u6559\u5ba4\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\uff01\u4e57\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30ef\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u8ffd\u5f93\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5143\u306b\u3057\u305f\u4e57\u308c\u308b\u5168\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u8eca\u4e21\u304c\u8a95\u751f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6559\u5ba4\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\uff01\u4e57\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30ef\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- 32\u500b\u306eIR\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u8eca\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Arduino\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c1\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u7528\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30d0\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u8d70\u884c\u3078\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1"]}

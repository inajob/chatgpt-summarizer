The folks at Slant 3D have found that printing enclosures at a 45\u00b0 provides an excellent balance of these properties, with some added advantages for high volume printing. The trick is to prevent the part from falling over when balance on a edge, but in the video after the break [Gabe Bentz]\u00a0 demonstrate Slant 3Ds solution of minimalist custom supports.\nThe traditional vertical or horizontal orientations come with drawbacks like excessive post-processing and weak layer alignment. Printing at 45\u00b0 reduces waste but strengthens the end product by aligning the layer lines in a way that resists splitting across common stress points. When scaling up production, this orientation comes with the added advantage of minimal bed contact area, allowing the printer to auto-eject the part by pushing it off the bed with print head.\n\nTo keep the part stable while printing in this orientation Slant 3D designed a fin-like support structure attached to the back of the enclosure with small sprues. This wastes significantly less time and material than auto-generated supports, and snaps away cleanly, leaving behind minimal imperfections that are easily addressed. To improve aesthetics and hide layer lines, Slant 3D also recommend adding texture to the external surfaces of enclosures. On 3D printed parts this detail costs nothing, while it would have added significant costs to injection molded parts.\nWere intrigued by this creative twist on 3D printings capabilities\u2014proving once again that a simple shift in perspective (or in this case, orientation) can unlock new design potentials.\nSlant 3D use FDM 3D printing for mass production [Gabe] even hosted a Hack Chat on the subject. They have come up with a number of innovative design tricks which are also useful for the hobbyist. These include improved corner brackets, robust living hinges and better alignment features for 3d printed assemblies.\n"}

But as [Le petit train du Berry] shows us in a video, its possible to make one yourself and its easier than you might think (French language video with truly awful YouTube auto-translation).\nAt the heart of the design is a coreless motor driving a worm gear at each end that engages with a gear on each axle. The wheelsets and power pickups are off-the-shelf items. The chassis meanwhile is 3D printed, and since this is an ongoing project we see two versions in the video. The V5 model adds a bearing, which its predecessor lacked.\nThe result is a pretty good power bogie, but its not without its faults. The gear ratio used is on the high side in order to save height under a model train body, and in the version without a bearing a hard-wearing filament is required because PLA will wear easily. Were guessing this isnt the last well see of this project, so we hope those are addressed in future versions.\nWe like this project and we think you will too after youve watched the video below the break. For more home-made model railway power, how about a linear motor?\n\n"}

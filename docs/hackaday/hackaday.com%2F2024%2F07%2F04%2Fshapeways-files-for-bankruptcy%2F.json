As these financial arrangements always go, this may or may not mean the end of the service, but it\u2019s a sure sign that their business wasn\u2019t running as well as you\u2019d hope.\nOne of the standout features of Shapeways was always that they made metal printing affordable to the home gamer. Whether it was something frivolous like a custom gear-shifter knob, or something all-too functional like a prototype rocket engine, it was neat to have the alternative workflow of iterative design at home and then shipping out for manufacturing.\nWe don\u2019t want to speculate too much, but we\u2019d be surprised if the rise of similar services in China wasn\u2019t part of the reason for the bankruptcy. The market landscape just isn\u2019t what it was way back in 2013. (Sadly, the video linked in this article isn\u2019t around any more. If anyone can find a copy, post up in the comments?) So while Shapeways may or may not be gone, it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t get metal parts made anymore.\nStill, we\u2019re spilling a little for the OG.\nThanks [Aaron Eiche] for the breaking news tip!", "title": "Shapeways: \u521d\u306e\u8da3\u5473\u6d3e\u5411\u30513D\u5370\u5237\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u5012\u7523\u3092\u7533\u8acb", "body": "\u4eba\u6c17\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u88fd\u9020\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3001Shapeways\u304c\u7834\u7523\u3092\u7533\u8acb\u3002\u91d1\u878d\u9762\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3067\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u7d42\u4e86\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u305f\u70b9\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3082\u8003\u616e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002Shapeways\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3082\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u624b\u6bb5\u306f\u307e\u3060\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Shapeways: \u521d\u306e\u8da3\u5473\u6d3e\u5411\u30513D\u5370\u5237\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u5012\u7523\u3092\u7533\u8acb", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u5370\u5237\u304c\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u305fShapeways", "Shapeways\u306e\u5012\u7523\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u53f0\u982d\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u6027\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u7d99\u3050\u3053\u3068\u306f\u53ef\u80fd", "Shapeways\u3078\u306e\u30aa\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\uff1a\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3078\u306e\u611f\u8b1d"]}

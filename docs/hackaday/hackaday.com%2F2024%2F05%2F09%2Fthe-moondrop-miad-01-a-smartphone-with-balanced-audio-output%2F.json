An interesting counterpoint here regarding the latter is the newly released Moondrop MIAD 01 smartphone.\nAs a relatively well-known manufacturer of audio equipment including in-ear monitors (IEMs), the announcement of a smartphone came out of left field, but the specifications make sense. Of particular interest are the dual audio jacks: one 3.5 mm TRRS and one 4.4 mm balanced TRRS, making it a good match for high-end headphones that support balanced audio.\n\nWhile the smartphone hardware is your average mid-range selection, featuring a MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC  its main selling point are the dual Cirrus Logic MasterHiFi DACs, that power the dual audio jacks. Its also the reason behind the name: Mobile Internet Audio Device, or MIAD for short.\nGiven Moondrops audio enthusiast market, this tracks. These are people for whom the mere mentioning of Bluetooth Audio or USB-C-to-audio jack dongle is likely to evoke a less than favorable response.\nIn terms of software, Moondrop says the phone will offer a native Android 13 experience, which hopefully means it will be free from manufacturer-specific changes and bloatware. Youll need to manually install Google Mobile Services though, as is often the case with Android devices that arent from the major players in the industry.\nAs reported by Android Authority, the MIAD 01 is available via select outlets for $399. Details like software updates remain to be clarified, but this might be the most over the top audio-centric smartphone we have seen so far. It definitely gives Sonys current range of Android-based Walkmans a run for their money, while even having phone functionality in the package.", "title": "\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7 MIAD 01 \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3: \u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u304c\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5931\u3044\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u4e2d\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u306eMoondrop MIAD 01\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30cf\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b2\u3064\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3001\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30c6\u30c3\u30af Dimensity 7050 SoC\u642d\u8f09\u3002Android 13\u3092\u6a19\u6e96\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u306f$399\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7 MIAD 01 \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3: \u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u97f3\u8cea\u91cd\u8996\u306e Moondrop MIAD 01 \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3: \u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc", "Moondrop MIAD 01: \u30cf\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u624b\u639b\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3", "\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9: Moondrop MIAD 01 \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "Moondrop MIAD 01 \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3: Android\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u4e2d\u5fc3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

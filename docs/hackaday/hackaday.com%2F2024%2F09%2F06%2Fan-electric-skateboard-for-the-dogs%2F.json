[Simone Giertz]s three-legged pup, [Scraps], got the chance to try a LEGO Technic board for her thrills.\nThis electric LEGO skateboard features six motors and paw pedals to let [Scraps] steer while [Giertz] remotely controls the speed of the board. While its not a particularly fast ride, it does let [Scraps] live out her dreams of being a YouTube dog skateboard celebrity.\nA video from [Giertz] wouldnt be complete without a life lesson, and this time it was the importance of rest to the creative process. Sometimes when a solution eludes you, its just time to take a break. The steering mechanism, in particular, was giving her trouble but became simple the next morning. Were also treated to an adorable shot of [Scraps] napping when the initial shoot of her riding the board wasnt going as planned.\nWant to try your hand at making your own skateboard? How about a deck from recycled plastic, tank treads instead of wheels, or is a rocket-powered skateboard more your speed?\n\n"}

But once youve had the film developed, theres a need for a projector to enjoy the result. Far better to digitize it for a more modern viewing and editing experience. [Elbert] has made a digitizer for 8mm film which takes the best approach, snapping each frame individually to be joined together in a video file as a whole.\nThe frame of the device is 3D printed, but some parts of a film transport must be higher quality than a printed part can deliver. These, in particular the sprockets, are salvaged from a film viewer, and the movement is powered by a set of stepper motors. The steppers are controlled by an ESP32, and the optics are provided by a USB microscope. All this is hooked up to a PC which grabs each image, and finally stitches them all together using ffmpeg.\nAs anyone who has dabbled in 8mm film will tell you, there is a lot in the quality of a film digitizer, and its often worth paying for a professional job from someone aimed at the film-making world rather than you local photographic print booth. It would be interesting to take a look at this device, and see whether its quality is worth pursuing. After all, some of us have been known to dabble in 8mm film.", "title": "\u300c8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806\u300d", "body": "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u611f\u899a\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u306f\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002\u958b\u767a\u5f8c\u306f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3088\u308a\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306b\u7de8\u96c6\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002Elbert\u306f\u9bae\u660e\u306a8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3001\u5404\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u500b\u5225\u306b\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u3066\u304b\u3089\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u307e\u3068\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806\u300d", "\u300cretro\u306a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u300d", "\u300cESP32\u5236\u5fa1\u306e8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff1a8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30ba\u300d", "\u300c\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u518d\u751f\uff1aDIY 8mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d"]}

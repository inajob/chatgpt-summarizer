Its eye-catching enough, and it has the useful property of providing a diffuse light from multiple angles that makes it a promising candidate for a work lamp. Thats enough for [Daniel James] to create his own lamp on a similar vein.\nThe electronics of his lamp are straightforward enough: a 12 volt LED strip whose brightness is controlled by a Pi Pico in response to a potentiometer as a brightness control. Its not quite stiff enough to form the arch itself, so hes created a 3D printed chain that forms the structure of the lamp. Similar to a bicycle chain in the way its constructed, it has individual links that slot together and pivot. The electronics are in the printed base at one end.\nWe like this lamp a lot, for the light it gives on the bench and for the ingenuity of the printed chain. We might even make one for ourselves.", "title": "- IKEA SM\u00c5SN\u00d6RE\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "IKEA\u306eLED\u4ed8\u304d\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u68d2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3002", "titles": ["- IKEA SM\u00c5SN\u00d6RE\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u53ef\u5909\u8f1d\u5ea6\u306eLED\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u8a2d\u8a08", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u7167\u660e\u5668\u5177", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u68d2\u3068LED\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "- \u5de5\u623f\u3092\u7167\u3089\u3059\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u5b9f\u73fe\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

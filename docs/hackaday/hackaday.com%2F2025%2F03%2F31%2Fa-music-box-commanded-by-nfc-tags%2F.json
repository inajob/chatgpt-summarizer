It inspired him to build an audio device using the same concept, only with music instead of childrens stories.\nThe NFC Music Player very much does what it says on the tin. Present it with an NFC card, and it will play the relevant music in turn. An ESP32 WROOM-32E lives at the heart of the build, which is hooked up over I2S with a MAX98357A Class D amplifier for audio output. Theres also an SD card slot for storing all the necessary MP3s, and a PN532 NFC reader for reading the flash cards that activate the various songs. Everything is laced up inside a simple 3D-printed enclosure with a 3-watt full range speaker pumping out the tunes.\nIts an easy build, and a fun one at that\u2014theres something satisfying about tossing a flash card at a box to trigger a song. Files are on Github for the curious.\u00a0Weve featured similar projects before, like the Yaydio\u2014a fun NFC music player for kids. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- NFC\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\uff01\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "Luca Dentella\u306fNFC\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- NFC\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\uff01\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aNFC\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- MP3\u3068NFC\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\uff1a\u97f3\u697d\u304c\u6d41\u308c\u308b\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6"]}

Still, sometimes it can be hard to find exactly what youre looking for, particularly if you want weird sizes, strange treads, or something that is very specifically scale-accurate. In any of these cases, you might like to make your own tires. [Build It Better] shows us how to do just that!\nMaking your own tires is fairly straightforward once you know how. You start out by producing a 3D model of your desired tire. You then create a two-piece negative mold of the tire, which can then be printed out on a 3D printer; [Build It Better] provides several designs online. From there, its simply a matter of filling the tire molds with silicone rubber, degassing, and waiting for them to set. All you have to do then is demold the parts, do a little trimming and post-processing, and youve got a fresh set of boots for your favorite RC machine.\n[Build It Better] does a great job of demonstrating the process, including the basic steps required to get satisfactory results. Weve featured some other great molding tutorials before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

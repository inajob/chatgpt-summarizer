Of course chemical photography still exists, and there are a bunch of us who love it for what it is, but even as we hang up our latest strip of negatives to dry we have to admit that its no longer mainstream. Among those enthusiasts who work with conventional black-and-white or dye-coupler colour film are a special breed whose chemistry takes them into more obscure pathways.\nWet-collodion plates for example, or in the case of [Jon Hilty], the Lumi\u00e8re autochrome process. This is a colour photography process from the early years of the twentieth century, employing a layer of red, green, and blue grains above a photosensitive emulsion. Its preparation is notoriously difficult, and hes lightened the load somewhat with the clever use of CNC machinery to automate some of it.\nPressing the plates via CNC\nHis web site has the full details of how he prepares and exposes the plates, so perhaps its best here to recap how it works. Red, green, and blue dyed potato starch grains are laid uniformly on a glass plate, then dried and pressed to form a random array of tiny RGB filters. The photographic emulsion is laid on top of that, and once it is ready the exposure is made from the glass side do the light passes through the filters.\nIf the emulsion is then developed using a reversal process as for example a slide would be, the result is a black and white image bearing colour information in that random array, which when viewed has red, green, and blue light from those starch filters passing through it. To the viewers eye, this then appears as a colour image.\nWe cant help being fascinated by the autochrome process, and while we know well never do it ourselves its great to see someone else working with it and producing 21st century plates that look a hundred years old.\nWhile this may be the first time weve featured such a deep dive into autochrome, its certainly not the first time weve looked at alternative photographic chemistries.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30eb\u30df\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "2024\u5e74\u306e\u5199\u771f\u306f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u304c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3060\u304c\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u5199\u771f\u3082\u672a\u3060\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002\u7279\u306b\u53e4\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001Jon Hilty\u6c0f\u306eLumi\u00e8re autochrome\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306f\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002CNC\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u7c21\u7565\u5316\u3057\u3001\u9ed2\u767d\u5199\u771f\u306b\u8272\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u7279\u5225\u306a\u6280\u6cd5\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30eb\u30df\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u4f5c\u6210", "CNC\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u5199\u771f\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\uff1a\u30eb\u30df\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0", "\u9ed2\u767d\u5199\u771f\u306b\u8272\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30eb\u30df\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

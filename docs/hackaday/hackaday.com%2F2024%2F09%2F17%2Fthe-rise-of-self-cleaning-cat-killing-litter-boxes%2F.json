That is, unless said litter box-cleaning robot kills said cat. Thats the gruesome topic that [Philip Bloom], also known as the bloke of the One Man Five Cats channel on YouTube, decided to investigate after coming across a report about a certain Amazon-bought unit.\nThe theory of a self-cleaning litter box: a happy Mr. Fluffles.\nAlthough he was unable to get the (generic  often rebranded) unit off Amazon UK, he did get it via AliExpress for \u00a3165 + \u00a380 shipping. Although this version lacks the cute ears of other variants, its still effectively the same unit, with the same moving components and mechanism. An initial test with a cat plushie gave the result that can be observed in the above image, where the inner part with the opening will move upwards, regardless of whether a cat is currently poking through said opening. Once the victim is stuck, there is no obvious way to free the trapped critter, which has already led to the death of a number of cats.\nThe other self-cleaning litter boxes which [Philip] owns have a number of safety features, including a weight sensor, an infrared sensor above the opening to detect nearby critters, a top that will pop off rather than trap a critter, as well as a pinch sensor. During a test with his own hand, [Philipp] managed to get injured, and following a banana test, he had a nice banana smoothie.\nWhat takes the cake here is that after [Philipp] connected the mobile app for the litter box, he found that there was a firmware update that seems to actually change the machine to use the pinch and infrared sensors that do exist in the litter box, but which clearly were not used properly or at all with the shipped firmware. This means that anyone who buys any of these self-cleaning litter boxes and does not update the firmware runs the significant risk of losing their pet(s) in a gruesome incident. In the video a number of such tragic deaths are covered, which can be rather distressing for any cat lover.\nOf note here is that even with the improved firmware, any issue with the sensors will still inevitably lead to the tragic death of Mr. Fluffles. If you do want to obtain a self-cleaning litter box, make sure to for example get one of [Philip]s recommendations which come with a paw stamp of approval from his own precious fluff balls, rather than a random unit off Amazon or AliExpress.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u81ea\u5df1\u6e05\u6383\u5f0f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\uff1a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e8b\u6545\u591a\u6570\u300d", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u732b\u306e\u304a\u4e16\u8a71\u3092\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u732b\u306e\u5e78\u305b\u3068\u98fc\u3044\u4e3b\u306e\u5e78\u305b\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u732b\u7802\u7bb1\u306e\u4e8b\u6545\u304c\u7d9a\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u52d5\u4f5c\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3084\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u66f4\u65b0\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u304c\u3001\u732b\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u306b\u306f\u54c1\u8cea\u4fdd\u8a3c\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5546\u54c1\u3092\u9078\u3076\u3053\u3068\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u81ea\u5df1\u6e05\u6383\u5f0f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\uff1a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e8b\u6545\u591a\u6570\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u5df1\u6e05\u6383\u5f0f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u60b2\u5287\u300d", "\u300cYouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u691c\u8a3c\uff1a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u9069\u5207\u306a\u81ea\u5df1\u6e05\u6383\u5f0f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\u300d", "\u300c\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u304b\u300d"]}

What was surprising about this, though, is how many of our readers and writers alike felt touched by the Tamiya model company. I mean, they made great models, and they\u2019re definitely a quality outfit, but the outpouring of fond memories across a broad spectrum was striking.\nFor example, we originally ran the story as breaking news, but our art director Joe Kim spent a good part of his childhood putting together Tamiya kits, and felt like he absolutely had to do a portrait of Mr.\u00a0Tamiya to pay his respects. I presume Joe is more on the painting-the-models end of the spectrum of Tamiya customers, given his artistic bent. Jenny\u2019s writeup is absolutely touching, and her fond remembrances of the kits shines through her writing.\nMyself, I\u2019m on the making-small-robots end of the spectrum, and was equally well served. Back in the early 90s, the \u201ctwin motor gearbox\u201d was a moderately challenging and tremendously rewarding build for me, but it was also the only variable-ratio small motor gearbox that we had easy access to for making small bots to run around the living room.\nIndeed, the Tamiya line included a whole series of educational models and components that were just perfect for the budding robot builder. I\u2019m sure I have a set of their tank treads or a slip clutch in a box somewhere, even today.\nIt\u2019s nice to think of how many people\u2019s lives were touched by their kits, and to get even a small glimpse of that, you just need to read our comment section. We hope the company holds on to Mr. Tamiya\u2019s love for quality kits that inspire future generations, whether they end up becoming artists, engineers, or simply hackers.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

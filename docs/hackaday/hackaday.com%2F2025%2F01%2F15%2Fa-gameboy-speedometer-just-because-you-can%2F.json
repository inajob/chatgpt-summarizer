Pulling it off meant interfacing the handheld with the vehicles CAN bus system, so whether youre into retro gaming or car hacking, this project has something to offer.\nShowing real-time vehicle speed on the Game Boy sounds like it should be relatively easy, but the iconic game system wasnt exactly built for such a task. Its 2 MHz CPU and 160144 pixel dot-matrix screen were every kids dream in 1989, but using it as a car dashboard is pushing it. To bridge that gap, [John] designed two custom circuit boards. One interfaces with the Game Boy, intercepting its memory requests and feeding it data from a microcontroller. The other processes the CAN bus signals, translating speed information into a form the Game Boy can display. [John] used inexpensive tools and software to read the CAN bus data, and used GBDK-2020 to write the software in C. His video goes in great detail on how to do this.\nMonths of work have gone into decoding the Game Boy\u2019s data bus and creating a schematic for the interface board. Tricking the Game Boy into thinking it was loading a game, while actually displaying incoming speed data. The screen\u2019s low resolution and slow refresh rate rendered it barely readable in a moving vehicle. But [John]\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t practicality \u2014 it was just proving it could be done.\nWant to dive deep into the Game Boy?\u00a0 Have you seen the Ultimate Game Boy talk?\n\n", "title": "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u901f\u5ea6\u8a08\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001CAN\u30d0\u30b9\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3002\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u3088\u308a\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8eca\u4e21\u901f\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3068CAN\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u52b9\u7387\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u305b\u305a\u3001\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3067\u8eca\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\u6311\u6226\u306e\u8a73\u7d30"]}

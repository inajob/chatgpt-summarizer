The Zynq is part FPGA and part CPU, and while it has been around for a while, we dont see nearly as many projects about it as wed like.\nRich covers everything from the power system to HDMI, USB, DDR RAM, and everything in between. By the end, hes able to boot PetaLinux.\n\nThe Zynq SoC includes an ARM Cortex-A9 Based APU and an Artix-7 FPGA (or a Kintex-7 FPGA on higher models). In case you missed it, Xilinx was recently acquired by AMD, which is why you might have remembered this as a Xilinx part.\nWeve heard from [Rich] before. Back in 2021 we saw his Arduino Brings USB Mouse To Homebrew Computer. Dont miss his follow-up playlist: Building on my Zynq-7000 in which he takes his Zynq-7000 board even further.\nIf youre interested in FPGA technology but need something more easy going to get you started, be sure to check out how to build a 6809 CPU on an FPGA. Or, if you need something even simpler, report for boot camp.\n\nThanks to [Alex] for the tip!", "title": "- AMD Zynq-7000 SoC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "YouTube\u306e23\u672c\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3001Rich\u304cAMD Zynq-7000 SoC\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002FPGA\u3068CPU\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001PetaLinux\u3082\u8d77\u52d5\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- AMD Zynq-7000 SoC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- FPGA\u3068CPU\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1aZynq-7000\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "- \u96fb\u6e90\u304b\u3089HDMI\u307e\u3067\uff1aRich\u306e23\u672c\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba", "- PetaLinux\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eZynq-7000\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- FPGA\u6280\u8853\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01Zynq-7000\u3092\u3055\u3089\u306b\u6df1\u304f\u63a2\u308b"]}

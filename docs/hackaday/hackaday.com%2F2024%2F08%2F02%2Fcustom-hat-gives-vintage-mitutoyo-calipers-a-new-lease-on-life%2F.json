The Japanese company has been making precision measuring instruments for the better part of 100 years, and users appreciate their precision almost as much as the silky smooth feel of their tools. If you can afford it, a Mitutoyo caliper is quite an addition to your toolbox.\nAs good as they are, though, theyre not perfect, which is what led to this clever Mitutoyo digital caliper hack by [turbanedengineer]. The calipers in question, a digital set from the early 1980s, happen to have a unique history with a tangential Hackaday angle  they belonged to [Dhaval], mechanical engineer and avid motorcyclist who happens to be the late elder brother of our own [Anool Mahidharia].\nThe tool, in need of a little TLC, made its way to [turbanedengineer] who first restored the broken battery contacts. Once powered up again, it became apparent that while the calipers native metric measurements were spot on, the internal conversion to inches was considerably off. This led [turbanedengineer] to the data port on the tool, which is intended to send serial data to an external computer for logging measurements. After a little experimentation to nail down the data format, he prototyped a tiny circuit using an ATtiny85 and an OLED display that reads the caliper data, converts metric to inches, and displays both measurements on the screen. The prototype led to a more permanent version, which cleverly sits over the original display and taps into the data port without any free wires. The video below shows the very slick results.\nOur hearts go out to [Anool] and his family for their loss, and we tip our hats to [turbanedengineer] for his thoughtful and respectful hack of a storied tool. We know that anthropomorphizing tools makes no rational sense, but we think its safe to say that a tool like this has a soul, and its probably happy to be back in the game.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30df\u30c4\u30c8\u30e8\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "body": "Mitutoyo\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3002Caliper\u306e\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u5909\u63db\u304c\u305a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001ATtiny85\u3068OLED\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3002\u611f\u52d5\u7684\u306a\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30df\u30c4\u30c8\u30e8\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "\u300c1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6539\u9020\u300d", "\u300cATtiny85\u3068OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6539\u9020\u300d", "\u300c\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u300d", "\u300c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3078\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30df\u30c4\u30c8\u30e8\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f\u300d"]}

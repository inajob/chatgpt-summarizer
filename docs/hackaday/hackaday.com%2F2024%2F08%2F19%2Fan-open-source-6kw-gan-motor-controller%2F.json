High voltage or current, low noise figures, or extreme frequencies make us nervous.\u00a0 [Orion Serup] from CrabLabs has been turning up a few of those variables\u00a0and has created a\u00a0fairly beefy 3-phase motor driver using GaN technology that can operate\u00a0up to 80V at 70A. GaN semiconductors are a newer technology that enables greater power handling in smaller packages than seems possible, thanks to high electron mobility and thermal conductivity in the material compared to silicon.\nThe KiCAD schematic shows a typical high-power driver configuration, broken down into a gate pre-driver, the driver itself, and the following current and voltage sense sub-circuits. As is typical with high-power drivers, these operate in a half-bridge configuration with identical N-channel GaN transistors (specifically part EPC2361) driven by dedicated gate drivers (thats the pre-driver bit) to feed enough current into the device to enable it to switch quickly and reliably.\nThe design uses the LM1025 low-side driver chip for this task, as youd be hard-pushed to drive a GaN transistor with discrete components! You may be surprised that the half-bridge driver uses a pair of N-channel devices, not a symmetric P and N arrangement, as you might use to drive a low-power DC motor. This is simply because, at these power levels, P-channel devices are a rarity.\nWhy are P-channel devices rare? N-channel devices utilise electrons as the majority charge carrier, but P-channel devices utilise holes, and the mobility of holes in GaN is very low compared to that of electrons, resulting in much worse ON-resistance in a P-channel and, as a consequence, limited performance. Thats why you rarely see P-channel devices in a circuit like this.\n\nOf course, schematic details are only part of the problem. High-power design at the PCB level also requires careful consideration. As seen from the project images, this involves heavy, thick copper traces on two or more heavily via-stitched layers to maximise copper volume and lower resistance as far as possible.\u00a0 But, you can overdo this and end up with too much inductance in critical areas, quickly killing many high-power devices. Another vital area is the footprint design for the GaN device and how it connects to the rest of the circuit. Get this wrong or mess up the soldering, and you can quickly end up with a much worse performance!\nWeve seen DIY high-power controllers here a few times. Heres an EV controller that uses discrete power modules. Another design we saw a few years ago drives IGBTs for a power output of 90kW.", "title": "GaN\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f3\u76f8\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3084\u9ad8\u96fb\u6d41\u3001\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3001\u6975\u7aef\u306a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u611f\u3058\u308b\u3002CrabLabs\u306eOrion Serup\u306f\u3001GaN\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3\u76f8\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002PCB\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3082\u614e\u91cd\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u534a\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3084GaN\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["GaN\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f3\u76f8\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u30fb\u9ad8\u96fb\u6d41\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u8a2d\u8a08", "PCB\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "LM1025\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30d5\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u69cb\u6210", "DIY\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e8b\u4f8b"]}

In much of the radio communication world, that impedance happens to be 50\u03a9. But in the real world, your antenna may not give you quite the match you hoped for. For that reason, many hams use antenna tuners. This is especially important for modern radios that tend to fold their power output back if the mismatch is too great to protect their circuitry from high voltage spikes. But a tuner has to be adjusted, and often, you have to put a signal out over the air to make the adjustments to match your antenna to your transmitter.\nThere are several common designs of antenna tuners, but they all rely on some set of adjustable capacitors and inductors. The operator keys the transmitter and adjusts the knobs looking for a dip in the SWR reading. Once you know the settings for a particular frequency, you can probably just dial it back in later, but if you change frequency by too much or your antenna changes, you may have to retune.\nIt is polite to turn down the power as much as possible, but to make the measurements, you have to send some signal out the antenna. Or do you?\nSeveral methods have been used in the past to adjust antennas, ranging from grid dip meters to antenna analyzers. Of course, these instruments also send a signal to the antenna, but usually, they are tiny signals, unlike the main transmitter, which may have trouble going below a watt or even five watts.\nNew Gear\nHowever, a recent piece of gear can make this task almost trivial: the vector network analyzer (VNA). Ok, so the VNA isnt really that new, but until recently, they were quite expensive and unusual. Now, you can pick one up for nearly nothing in the form of the NanoVNA.\nThe VNA is, of course, a little transmitter that typically has a wide range coupled with a power detector. The transmitter can sweep a band, and the device can determine how much power goes forward and backward into the device under test. That allows it to calculate the SWR easily, among other parameters.\n\nIn Practice\nThis sounds good, but how does it work? Well, to find out, I took a long wire connected to an MFJ Versa Tuner II and fed the NanoVNAs TX port to the tuner. With the tuner in bypass, the screen looked like the first image. It actually had a pretty low SWR near 14 MHz, but everywhere else was not going to work very well at all.\nThe antenna happened to have a natural dip on 20 meters. The range of measurement is 1 to 30 MHz.\nThe next step was to switch the tuner into the circuit. Ideally, you could infinitely vary the inductor and both capacitors, but making roller inductors is a cost, so many tuners  including this one  have switches that select taps on the inductor, meaning you can only change it in fixed steps. That isnt usually a problem, though, because you can adjust the capacitors to make up for it.\nSince you arent transmitting, theres no rush, and you can easily switch things around and turn knobs until you can find a null. If you were using the actual transmitter, youd want to avoid switching the inductor hot because the switch contacts wont appreciate any high-power RF.\nThe tuner created a few dips, one on the 40 meter band\nI centered the frequency range around 7 MHz and found the lowest setting I could on the tuner. Then, I zoomed back out to the entire HF band. Not bad.\nI went through and found null spots for all the ham bands. It was also possible to measure the SWR for bands I cant transmit on (for example, 15 MHz, to listen to WWV).\nOnce I had jotted down all the settings, it was time to reconnect the transmitter. Well, technically, a transceiver  in this case, an Icom IC-7300. Even without transmitting, having the knobs adjusted correctly definitely helped with receiving, often strikingly so.\nBut Did It Really Work?\nMy first attempt was to use the frequency exactly where I had tuned before switching in the transmitter. As youd expect, the transmitter saw a low SWR and had no issues, but changing frequencies was a little different.\nThe knobs on the tuner are not especially precise. Some high-end devices have multi-turn knobs with counters to help you get exactly back to some setting, but this tuner has no such thing. So when the dot on the knob is on, say, 2, it is hard to know for sure if it is exactly where you had it last time it was in the same position.\nA quick CQ on 15 meters with questionable propagation conditions\nHowever, you can get close. Changing frequencies and tuner settings would sometimes give me a great SWR, but sometimes it was a little high (never any more than, maybe, 1.5:1). A minor tweak of the two capacitors on the tuner would resolve it quite easily.\nA quick CQ on 15 meters resulted in the map you can see from the reverse beacon network. The furthest away I was heard was a bit more than 1,800 miles away. Not bad for a fairly short wire hung over a tree. Subsequent testing on several bands resulted in many contacts across four continents in a few hours.\nTakeaway\nDo you need to use a VNA to tune? No, but it sure is handy. Sure, it generates a tiny signal, but nothing like your transmitter. I like tuning very quietly and precisely without risking the expensive final amplifiers in my station. A good tuner can load up almost anything, and while you wont get the performance you would get out of a proper antenna, you can still get on the air and have a lot of fun.\nOf course, the VNA can do other things too. It can characterize components and modules like filters. You can even use them as time domain reflectometers to troubleshoot cables. It is worth noting that while I took pictures of the VNA so you could see what it would look like, it is actually better to use one of several programs on your PC that can create graphs and data that would be easy to work with. For example, I often use this one.\nWant more things to do with your VNA? You can even map antenna patterns with one.", "title": "50\u03a9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "body": "\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u6700\u5927\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3001\u9001\u4fe1\u5143\u3068\u8ca0\u8377\u304c\u540c\u3058\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8abf\u6574\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001SWR\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3059\u3002VNA\u306f\u3053\u306e\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["50\u03a9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "\u96fb\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u30ca\u30ceVNA\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8abf\u6574\u306e\u7c21\u4fbf\u3055", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3068\u30cf\u30e0\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u8abf\u6574", "VNA\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u3068\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u7279\u6027\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0"]}

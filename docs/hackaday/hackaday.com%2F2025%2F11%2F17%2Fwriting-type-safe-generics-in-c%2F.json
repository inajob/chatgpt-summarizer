This extends to something like type-safe generics in C, as [Raph] demonstrates in a blog post.\nAfter running through the various ways that generics are also being implemented using methods including basic preprocessor macros and void pointers, the demonstrated method is introduced. While not necessarily a new one, the advantage with this method is that is type-safe. Much like C++ templates, these generics are evaluated at compile time, with the preprocessor handling both the type checking and filling in of the right template snippets.\nWhile somewhat verbose, it can be condensed into a single header file, doesnt rely on the void type or pointers and can be deduplicated by the linker, preventing bloat. If generics is what you are looking for in your C project, this might be a conceivable solution.", "title": "- C\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u6cd5", "body": "C\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u3082\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u6307\u5411\u3084\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u691c\u67fb\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- C\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u6cd5", "- C\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u6307\u5411\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u6642\u306b\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u308bC\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9", "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fC\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9", "- C\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

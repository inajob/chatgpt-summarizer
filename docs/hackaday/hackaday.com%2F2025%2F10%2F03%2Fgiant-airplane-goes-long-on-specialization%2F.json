Big turbines means big blades, and big blades need to be transported somehow. If air freight is going to stay relevant to the industry, were gonna need a bigger airplane.\nA startup called Radia has a plan for that plane, and it is a doosie. The WindRunner would clock in at a massive 108 meters (354 feet) long, but with a wingspan of just 80 m (262 ft). Thats very, very long, but it might not be the largest airplane, depending how you measure it. Comparing to the 88 m wingspan for the late, lamented An-225 Mriya, you can expect a lower payload capacity, but heavy payloads arent the point here. Wind turbine blades really arent that heavy. Theyre big, or they can be  the WindRunner is designed to fit a single 105 m blade within its long fuselage, or a pair of 90 m blades.\n\nYou can tell it has one job; theres just 3 m difference in length between the blade and the plane. Image: Radia.\nThats very little clearance, which is why the cockpit sits up top in a bulge that makes the thing look a bit like an enormous Carvair, for anyone who remembers that old prop-job  except for the H-tail, that is. Thats for a different reason than the An-225s use of the same feature, which was to keep the tails out of the wash of a back-mounted Buran space shuttle. With the WindRunner, the H-tail is simply so the tail will not be too tall to fit existing airport infrastructure. The Lockheed Constellation used a triple-tail for the same reason, way back when.\nThe Carvair, another cargo hauler with exactly one job. It was actually based on a DC-4, and not a Convair, but for a car carrier the name fits.Image: Eduard Marmet, CC3.0\nThe aircraft will of course be short-runway and rough-field capable, capable of taking off and landing on dry packed dirt or gravel in just 1,800 m, or 6000 ft  a little more than 10x its own enormous length. The payload it hauls into those rough fields will break no records at only 72.6 tonnes; Mriya could do 250 tonnes, but again, heavy lift isnt the goal here.\nThis plane has a very specific mission, to the point that we argue it might just qualify as a hack. It will be interesting to see if Radia can sign enough customers to get one (or more) built."}

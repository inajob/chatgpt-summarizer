The first attempt used apparently fake chips that were prone to overheating. He was able to get it to work and also walked through some Octave (a system similar to Matlab) simulations for the circuit. You can follow along in the video below.\nGetting the little multiplier chips into the breadboard was a bit of a challenge. Of course, there are a variety of ways to solve that problem. The circuit in question is from the always interesting [Glens Stuff] website.\nFrom that site:\nThe Lorenz system, originally discovered by American mathematician and meteorologist, Edward Norton Lorenz, is a system that exhibits continuous-time chaos and is described by three coupled, ordinary differential equations.\nSo, the circuit is an analog solution to the system of differential equations. Not bad for a handful of chips and some discrete components on a breadboard. Weve seen a similar circuit on Hackaday.io.\nCheck out our recent competition winners if you want to see op amps do their thing. Analog computers were a thing. They arent always that complicated, either.\n\n"}

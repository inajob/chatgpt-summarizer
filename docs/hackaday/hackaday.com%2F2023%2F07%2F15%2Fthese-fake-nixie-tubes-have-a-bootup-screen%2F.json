Using OLED displays as the fake Nixie elements might seem like cheating to some, the effect is really very well done.\nClock digits with bootup screens is something we didnt know we liked until we saw it.\nWhen it comes to Nixie elements, its hard to say which gets more attention and project time from hardware folks: original Nixie tube technology, or fake Nixie elements. Either way, their appeal is certainly undeniable.\nOriginal Nixie tubes have shown up in modern remakes of alarm clocks, and modern semiconductors make satisfying a Nixie tubes power requirements much easier with clever and compact Nixie drivers costing under $3 USD. This is also a good time to remind people that Nixie tubes dont have to be digits. This audio spectrum visualizer, for example, uses IN-13 tubes which serve as elements of a bar graph.\nAuthentic Nixie elements require high voltages and are labor-intensive to manufacture to say the least, and as far as fake Nixie elements go, this one looks pretty good once it lights up. You can see it in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n"}

[MH987] has a plan: superglue the board back and then bridge the traces with solder, solder paste, or wire. The exact method, of course, depends on the extent of the damage.\nWeve had some success with similar techniques, and, honestly, for single-sided boards, we would be tempted to add a thin backer behind the crack. Weve also used conductive paint to repair traces, but its good to have having as many tricks as possible because you never know what will work best for a particular repair. The post mentions that this is easier to do on a single-sided board, but it is certainly possible to do on a two-layer board.\nThe example repair is a Walkman which  if you are a youngster  was a portable music player that takes cassette tapes. These havent been made since 2010, so it is important to repair what you have.\nIf you cant repair your Walkman, you could build an updated version. If your board is seriously damaged, you might get hope from this more extreme repair."}

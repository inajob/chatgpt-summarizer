Thus it surprised us (and it might also surprise you too) that some level of self-driving can be performed by an Android phone. [Mankaran Singh] has the full details.\nIt starts with the realization that a modern smartphone contains the necessary sensors to\u00a0 perform basic self-driving, and then moves on to making a version of openpilot that can run on more than the few supported phones. Its not the driver-less car of science fiction but one which performs what we think is SAE level 2 self driving, which is cruise control, lane centering, and collision warning. They take it out on the road in a little Suzuki on a busy Indian dual carriageway in the rain, and while we perhaps place more trust in meat-based driving, it does seem to perform fairly well\nSelf driving features are codified into a set of levels for an easy reference on what each is capable of doing. Weve taken a look at it in the past, should you be interested."}

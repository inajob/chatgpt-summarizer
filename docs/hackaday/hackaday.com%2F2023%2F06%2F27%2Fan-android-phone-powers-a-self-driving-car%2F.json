Thus it surprised us (and it might also surprise you too) that some level of self-driving can be performed by an Android phone. [Mankaran Singh] has the full details.\nIt starts with the realization that a modern smartphone contains the necessary sensors to\u00a0 perform basic self-driving, and then moves on to making a version of openpilot that can run on more than the few supported phones. Its not the driver-less car of science fiction but one which performs what we think is SAE level 2 self driving, which is cruise control, lane centering, and collision warning. They take it out on the road in a little Suzuki on a busy Indian dual carriageway in the rain, and while we perhaps place more trust in meat-based driving, it does seem to perform fairly well\nSelf driving features are codified into a set of levels for an easy reference on what each is capable of doing. Weve taken a look at it in the past, should you be interested.", "title": "Android\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u3001Android\u642d\u8f09\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u3082\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002SAE\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb2\u306b\u76f8\u5f53\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30ba\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3001\u885d\u7a81\u8b66\u544a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3001\u96e8\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u9053\u8def\u3067\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Android\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\uff1f", "openpilot\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "SAE\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb2\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u3067\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u904b\u8ee2\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "\u96e8\u964d\u308a\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u9053\u8def\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u8eca\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u65bd", "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u306e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u5206\u3051\u3068\u306f\uff1f-SAE\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58-"]}

[Steve]s Pico-100BASE-TX library allows an RP2040 (or RP2350) microcontroller to stream data at roughly 11 Mbyte/s, enough to implement 100 MBit/s Fast Ethernet transmission.\nWeve seen 10BASE-T implemented on a Pico, but it takes a lot more than just shoveling bits faster to get 100BASE-T working. 10BASE-T uses two voltage levels and Manchester encoding, but 100BASE-T uses three voltage levels, which [Steve] cleverly implemented on the Pico with two GPIOs, and far more complex encoding. Check out the repositorys README for details as well as a couple example applications.\n[Steve] tells us that to the best of his knowledge, this is the first bit-banged 100 MBit/s Ethernet implementation using a microcontroller. Its transmit-only  reception being an entirely different beast  but its possible some enterprising soul might find a solution. If you do, be sure to let us know all about it!", "title": "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f100MBit/s Fast Ethernet\u306e\u9a5a\u304d", "body": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067100Mbit/s\u306eFast Ethernet\u304c\u5b9f\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f100MBit/s Fast Ethernet\u306e\u9a5a\u304d", "- Pico-100BASE-TX\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- 100BASE-T\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092GPIO\u3067\u5b9f\u88c5", "- \u521d\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30d0\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u30b0100MBit/s\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u306b\u671f\u5f85\uff01\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u3078"]}

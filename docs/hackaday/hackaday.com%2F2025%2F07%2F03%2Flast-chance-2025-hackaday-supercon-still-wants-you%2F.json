Today was going to be the last day to throw your hat in the ring for a slot to talk at Supercon in November, but were extending the deadline one more week, until July 10th. We have an almost full schedule, but were still missing your talk.\nSo if the thought of having missed the deadline fills you with regret, heres your second chance. We have spots for both 40-minute and 20-minute talks still open. We love to have a mix of newcomers as well as longtime Hackaday friends, so dont be shy.\nSupercon is a super fun time, and the crowd is full of energy and excitement for projects of all kinds. There is no better audience to present your feats of hardware derring-do, stories of reverse engineering, or other plans for world domination. Where else will you find such a density of like-minded hackers?\nDont delay, get your talk proposal in today.\n\n\n\n\n"}

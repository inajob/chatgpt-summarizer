The unstated spec is just as important: dont kill yourself or anyone else in the process. To that end, [Advanced] put much effort into making things as safe as possible. The basic architecture of the supply is pretty straightforward, with a ZVS driver and an AC flyback transformer. Powered by a 24-volt DC supply and an adjustable DC-DC converter, that setup alone yields something around 20kV  not too shabby, but still far short of the spec. The final push to the final voltage is thanks to a three-stage Cockcroft-Walton multiplier made with satisfyingly chunky capacitors and diodes. To ensure everything stays safe in the high-voltage stage, he took the precaution of potting everything in epoxy. Good thing, too; tests before potting showed arcing in the CW multiplier despite large isolation slots in the PCB.\nAside from the potting, some really interesting details went into this build, especially on the high-voltage side. The 3D-printed and epoxy-filled HV connector is pretty cool, as is the special wire needed to keep arcs at bay. The whole build is nicely detailed, too, with care taken to bond each panel of the rack-mount case to a common ground point.\nIts a nice build, and we cant wait to see what [Advanced Tinkering] does with it. In the meantime, if you want to get up to speed on handling high voltage safely, check out our HV primer.\n\n", "title": "50,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "50,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7406\u7531\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u306f\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u5236\u4f5c\u7269\u3082\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["50,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "20kV\u304b\u308950kV\u306b\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u4e09\u6bb5\u968e\u306eCockcroft-Walton\u4e57\u7b97\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u90e8\u5206\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305fHV\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306a\u3069", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\uff1aHV\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046"]}

However, you can do more with them, as [Something Physical] demonstrates with their nifty piezo noise box. Check out the video (and audio) below.\nThe construction is simple enough, attractive in its own way, with a rugged junk-assembly sort of style. The video starts out by demonstrating the use of a piezo element hooked up as a simple contact microphone, before developing it into something more eclectic.\nThe basic concept: Mount the piezo element to a metal box fitted with a variety of oddball implements. What kind of implements? Spiralled copper wires, a spring, and parts of a whisk. When struck, plucked, or twanged, they conduct vibrations through the box, the microphone picks them up, and the box passes the sound on to other audio equipment.\nIt might seem frivolous, but its got some real value for avant-garde musical experimentation. In particular, if youre looking for weird signals to feed into your effects rack or modular synth setup, this is a great place to start.\nWeve seen piezos put to other percussive uses before, too.\n\n"}

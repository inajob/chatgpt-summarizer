Take any old 1N4148 or 1N914 glass-package signal diode and wire it up right, and youve got yourself a nifty little IR detector.\nIts that simple.\nThe trick is to treat the diode just like you would a proper IR photodiode. The part should be reverse biased with a resistor inline, and the signal taken from the anode side. Point an IR remote at your little diode and youll readily see the modulated signal pop up on a scope, clear as day.\nThe phenomenon is discussed at length over on Stack Exchange. Indeed, its a simple fact that most semiconductor devices are subject to some sort of photoelectric effect or another. Its just that we stick the majority of them in opaque black packages so it never comes up in practice. In reality, things like photodiodes and phototransistors arent especially different from the regular parts\u2014theyre just put in transparent packages and engineered and calibrated to give predictable responses when used in such a way.\nIs this the way youd go if your project needed an IR detector? Probably not\u2014youd be better served buying the specific parts you need from the outset. But, if you find yourself in a pinch, and you really need to detect some IR signals and all youve got on hand is glass-package signal diodes? Yeah, you can probably get it to work.\nWhile this trick is well known to many oldheads, its often a lightbulb moment for many up-and-coming engineers and makers to realize this. Glass-packaged diodes arent the only light-sensitive parts out there, either. As weve explored previously, certain revisions of Raspberry Pi would reboot if exposed to a camera flash, while you can even use regular old LEDs as sensors if youre so inclined. If youve got your own secret knowledge about how to repurpose regular components in weird ways, dont hesitate to notify the tipsline!", "title": "- 1N4148\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306aIR\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "1N4148\u30841N914\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001IR\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 1N4148\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306aIR\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3067IR\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af", "- \u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3056\u308b\u5149\u691c\u51fa\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u306b\u3042\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\u3067IR\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6551\u6e08\u7b56"]}

A Flipper is cool as heck of course but not the cheapest of devices. Fortunately theres now an alternative in the form of the CapybaraZero. Its a poor-hackers Flipper Zero which you can assemble yourself from a heap of inexpensive modules.\nAt the centre is an ESP32-S3 board, which brings with it that chips wireless and Bluetooth capabilities. To that is added an ST7789 TFT display, a PN532 NFC reader, an SX1276 LoRa and multi-mode RF module, and an IR module. The firmware can be found through GitHub. Since the repo is nearly two years old and still in active development, were hopeful CapybaraZero will gain features and stability.\nIf youre interested in our coverage of the Canadian Flipper panic you can read it here, and meanwhile if youre using one of those NFC modules, consider tuning it."}

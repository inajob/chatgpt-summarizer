In that case, it can be mesmerizing like this Arduino-driven kinetic sand table.\nWhat you cant see. Image via [thang010146] on YouTubeLike many of these builds, it all started with an ordinary coffee table from the hackers favorite furnit\u00fcre store. [NewsonsElectronics] opened it up and added a 3mm-thick board to hold the sand and another to hold the rails and magnets.\nAfter designing some pieces to connect the rails and pulleys together, [NewsonsElectronics] let the laser cutter loose on some more 3mm stock. A pair of stepper motors connected to a CNC shield do all of the work, driving around a stack of magnets that causes the ball bearing to trudge beautifully through the sand.\nBe sure to check out the videos after the break. The first is a nice demonstration, and the second is the actual build video. In the third video, [NewsonsElectronics] explains how they could write the worlds smallest GRBL code to swing this with a single Arduino. Hint: it involves removing unnecessary data from the g-code generated by Sandify.\nDont have a laser cutter? Heres a sand table built from 3D printer parts.\n\n\n\n"}

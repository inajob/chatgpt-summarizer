Our hacker [Willow Cunningham] has sent us a copy of his homework. This is his final project for the ECE 574: Cluster Computing course at the University of Maine, Orono.\nIt was enjoyable going through the process of having a good look at everything in this project. The project is a cluster of 5x Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers  with one head node as the leader and four compute nodes that work on tasks. The software for the both nodes is written in C. The head node is connected to a workstation via USB 1.1 allowing the system to be controlled with a Python script.\nThe cluster is configured to process an embarrassingly parallel image convolution. The input image is copied into the head node via USB which then divvies it up and distributes it to n compute nodes via I2C, one node at a time. Results are given for n = {1,2,4} compute nodes.\nIt turns out that the work of distributing the data dwarfs the compute by three orders of magnitude. The result is that the whole system gets slower the more nodes we add. But were not going to hold that against anyone. This was a fascinating investigation and we were impressed by [Willow]s technical chops. This was a complicated project with diverse hardware and software challenges and hes done a great job making it all work and in the best scientific tradition.\nIt was fun reading his journal in which he chronicled his progress and frustrations during the project. His final report in IEEE format was created using LaTeX and Overleaf, at only six pages it is an easy and interesting read.\nFor anyone interested in cluster tech be sure to check out the 256-core RISC-V megacluster and a RISC-V supercluster for very low cost."}

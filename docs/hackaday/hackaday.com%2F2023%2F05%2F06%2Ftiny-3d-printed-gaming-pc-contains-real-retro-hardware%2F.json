This can become a problem, though, for those into vintage PC gaming: old PCs and their monitors are notoriously large and heavy, meaning that even a modest collection will quickly fill up a decent family home. There is a solution however, as [The Eric Experiment] demonstrates in his latest video. He designed and built a 3D-printed mini PC that runs on an actual 486 processor.\nAn ordinary desktop motherboard would have required a rather large case to begin with, so [Eric] started his project by buying an old industrial PC board. Such a device has the processor and all main motherboard components sitting on an ISA card, which then connects to other ISA cards through a backplane. This way, a complete system with expansion cards can be made way more compact than even the sleekest desktop PCs of the time. An SD-card-to-IDE converter makes for an extremely slim hard drive replacement, while a Gotek floppy emulator allows the system to boot as if theres actually a floppy drive present.\nEven the side panels slide in exactly like they do on real PC cases.\nAll of this is pretty neat to begin with, but by far the most impressive parts of the Tiny 486 project are the enclosures that [Eric] designed for the PC and its accompanying monitor. Both were modelled off real-world examples and are accurate down to the smallest details: the tilting stand that clips onto the base of the monitor for instance, or the moving latch on the faux 5.25 floppy drive. That latch operates a cleverly hidden door that reveals the USB connector for the floppy emulator. The compulsory seven-segment LED display on the mini towers front panel now finally serves a useful purpose  indicating which floppy image is currently active.\nSporting an Intel 486-DX4 100 MHz processor, 32 MB of RAM, a Tseng ET4000 video card and an ESS Audiodrive for sound, the tiny 486 can run DOS or Windows 95, although performance in the latter is a bit limited due to the lack of a local-bus video card. Its perfectly fine for most DOS games though, and a lot more practical than a full-sized desktop PC.\nThere are several ways to make a tiny game PC, like using PC/104 standard boards or repurposing old network equipment. The crucial part needed to turn it into a gaming machine is a proper sound card, which you can even build from scratch if needed. Thanks for the tip, [Nathan]!\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u672c\u7269\u306e486\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30df\u30cbPC\u304c\u8a95\u751f", "body": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u3001\u672c\u7269\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u3044PC\u3084\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u5927\u304d\u304f\u91cd\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001Eric Experiment\u6c0f\u306f\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b486\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u5efa\u9020\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002ISA\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u6975\u3081\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3001\u672c\u7269\u306ePC\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u7279\u5fb4\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u672c\u7269\u306e486\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30df\u30cbPC\u304c\u8a95\u751f", "\u5b9f\u7269\u306ePC\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u8d85\u30af\u30fc\u30eb", "\u65e7\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u672c\u7269\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\uff01\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b486\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u81ea\u4f5cPC", "\u672c\u7269\u306eISA\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u63a1\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30df\u30cbPC\u304c\u3001\u53e4\u3044PC\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6700\u9069", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3001SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u7d30\u578b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c"]}

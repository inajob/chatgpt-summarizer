As is so often the case, certain error codes have been found in common across failed units out in the community, and [Voultar] decided to investigate to see if he could fix this problem with a little hacking.\n[Voultar] wasnt able to source a Wii U with the much-discussed NAND failure mode, but he was able to source a number of supposedly bricked Wii U systems displaying the error codes 160-0101 and 160-0103.\u00a0The hack is achieved with an exploit in the Wii Us USB Host Stack descriptor parsing module, developed by [GaryOderNichts]. It allows the injection of a payload that lets one run unsigned code on the Wii U, achieved via a Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pico is ultimately used to boot off an SD card running a recovery program for the Wii U. By resetting the Wii Us coldboot title ID, it solves the error and gets the console booting properly, as per normal.\n[Voultar] was able to fix five consoles displaying the common error messages, which wed call a win. Its not going to be a fix for every failed Wii U out there, but if youve got the dreaded 160-0101 or -0103 errors, it might be worth a shot.\n\n"}

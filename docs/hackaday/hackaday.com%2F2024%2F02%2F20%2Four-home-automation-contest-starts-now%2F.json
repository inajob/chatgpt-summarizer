Nothing! That\u2019s why we\u2019re inviting you to submit your sweetest home automation hacks for a chance to win one of three $150 DigiKey gift certificates. The contest starts now and runs until April 16th.\n[Matej]s Home Buttons gets the job done in open-source style.We love to play around with home automation setups and have seen our fair share, ranging from the simple \u201cturn some lights on\u201d to full-blown cyber-brains that learn your habits and adapt to them. Where is your project on this continuum?\nWhether you\u2019re focused on making your life easier, saving energy, gathering up all the data about your usage patterns, or simply stringing some random functions together and calling it a \u201csystem,\u201d we\u2019d like to see it. Nothing is too big or too small if it makes your home life easier.\nHome is where the home automation is!\nTo enter, head over to Hackaday IO and start documenting your project there. We are, of course, interested in learning from what youve done, so the better the docs, the better your chances of winning. And if you need some inspiration, check out these honorable mention categories.\nHonorable Mention Categories\n\nCreature Comforts: Does your system make your house a home? Maybe it turns on and off the heaters to keep rooms just right, opens and closes the blinds for you, or maybe it turns on the nightlights when you\u2019re heading downstairs for a midnight snack. The Creature Comforts category is for you.\nEfficiency: Automation isn\u2019t just about convenience, but can help us save energy too. If your machines help you save money on your power and heating bills, show us!\nRube Goldberg: A \u201csystem\u201d sounds so formal, but a lot of ad hoc home automation projects are nonetheless super effective. If your home system grew organically and maybe resembles a collection of hacks more than a carefully orchestrated plan, it could be a Rube Goldberg setup.\nAll the Data: An automatic home makes a lot of data along the way.\u00a0 If you have a slick system for displaying it, or even just collecting it all, we\u2019d love to see it.\nRetrofit: Not everything works like you\u2019d want it to out of the box. Maybe you\u2019ve hacked into an air purification system or your washing machine to get it to play along? That\u2019s a home automation retrofit.\n\nThanks again to DigiKey for sponsoring this with three gift certificates!\n \n\n", "title": "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u958b\u50ac\u4e2d\uff01", "body": "$150\u306eDigiKey\u30ae\u30d5\u30c8\u5238\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9\uff012021\u5e744\u670816\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u53d7\u4ed8\u4e2d\u3002\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3001\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092Hackaday IO\u306b\u6295\u7a3f\u3057\u3066\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3002\u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u3001\u8cde\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "titles": ["\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u958b\u50ac\u4e2d\uff01", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\uff1a\u81ea\u5b85\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u66ae\u3089\u3057\u3092\u5feb\u9069\u306b", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u304b\u3089\u5feb\u9069\u7a7a\u9593\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3067\uff1a\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u52df\u96c6"]}

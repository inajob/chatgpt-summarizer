More modern ones detect not just the first reflection, but analyze subsequent reflections, or reflections that come in from different angles, to infer even more about what theyre looking at. These transient sensors usually arent the most accurate thing in the world, but four people from the University of Wisconsin managed to get far more out of one using some clever math. (Video, embedded below.)\nThe transient sensors under investigation here sends out a pulse of light and records what it receives from nine angles in individual histograms. It then analyzes these histograms to make a rough estimate of the distance for each direction. But the sensor wont tell us how it does so and it also isnt very accurate. The team shows us how you can easily get a distance measurement that is more accurate and continues by showing how the nine distance estimates can even distinguish the geometry its looking, although to a limited extent. But they didnt stop there: It can even detect the albedo of the material its looking at, which can be used to tell materials apart!\nOverall, a great hack and we think this technology has potential  despite requiring more processing power.\n"}

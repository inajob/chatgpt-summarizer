(To UEFI Systems, That Is)", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2025/05/29/bring-back-the-bios-to-uefi-systems-that-is/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bios-featured.jpg", "original_content": "At the dawn of the PC, IBM provided the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). It took care of bringing the machine up, and exposed a series of software hooks for the hardware. Over the years the BIOS and its updated descendants served us well, but as we entered a 64-bit world its limitations began to show.\nThe replacement was the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI, and the chances are youre viewing this on a machine which uses it in some capacity. But what if you only have UEFI and need BIOS to run a piece of older software? Never fear, because heres CSMWrap, which brings it back, just for you.\nUnder the hood its a wrapper for the SeaBIOS compatibility support module, doing the work of setting up the memory mapping such that it will load, and ensuring that other services such as the VGA BIOS are loaded. As it stands it can boot FreeDOS and some older Windows versions under UEFI in QEMU, and its claimed also run on real hardware. We dont often need to run DOS on our 2025 machine, but its neat to know we can.\nMeanwhile if the BIOS interests you, know that theres also an open source BIOS for the earliest of PCs.\n\nBIOS header image: Thomas Schanz, CC BY-SA 4.0."}

But [Z\u2192Z] has a different approach: dissecting MacPaint, the Apple drawing program from the 1980s.\nWhile the program looks antiquated by todays standards, it was pretty hot stuff back in the day. Things we take for granted today were big deals at the time. For example, being able to erase a part of something you drew prompted applause at an early public demo.\nWe enjoyed the way the program was tested, too. A software monkey was made to type keys, move things, and click menus randomly. The teardown continues with a look inside the Pascal and assembly code with interesting algorithms like how the code would fill an area with color.\nThe program has been called beautifully organized, and [Z\u2192Z] examines that assertion. Maybe the brilliance of it has been overstated, but it did work and it did influence many computer graphics programs over the years.\nWe love digging through old source code. Even old games.

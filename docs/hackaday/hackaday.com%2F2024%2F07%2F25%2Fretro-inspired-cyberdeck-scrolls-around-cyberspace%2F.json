But at the minimum, most in the community would agree that a proper deck should have a non-traditional form factor, and be designed to meet the unique needs of the builder. If youre looking for a fantastic example of both concepts, check out the Cyberdore 2064 from [Tommi L].\nAt first glance the 3D printed enclosure of the Cyberdore looks a bit like a Speak  Spell, but its really more of an amalgamation of everything that made 1980s computers so unique. Youve got the vents, the chunky switches, the undersized display, and of course, the handle. The case might have been extruded in 2024, but its doing a fantastic impression of a piece of tech from 40 years ago.\nOne of the key external features of the Cyberdore 2064 is the side-mounted rotary encoder that allows for smoothly scrolling through online feeds (such as your favorite hardware hacking site) or long documents. The cheap and easy to work with KY-040 encoder has been converted to a USB input device by way of a Pi Pico, and has been paired with an over-sized 3D printed knob that really makes this build stand out  not only visually, but in terms of usability. These cyberdeck builds often rely on touch screens for input, but we always appreciate a physical interface.\nUnder the hood youve got a Raspberry Pi Zero and an 18650 cell to keep the whole thing running while on the go. Though the Zero is certainly showing its age compared to the more modern variants of the Pi, for a device like this, raw computing power isnt really the driving concern. A mechanical keyboard usually rounds out these cyberdeck builds, but in this case, [Tommi] went with a fairly common Rii 518BT portable board thats been skillfully integrated into the front of the Cyberdore.\nAll of the STL files necessary to print out your own Cyberdore 2064 are available on Printables, and while [Tommi] didnt exactly provide build instructions, the write-up provides plenty of information to get you started.\nSo is it just us, or does looking at Cyberdore 2064 make you think its time for another Hackaday Cyberdeck Challenge?"}

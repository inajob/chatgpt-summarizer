As nice as it is to have them around, it can be difficult to care (or remember to care) for them all the time.\nPlantpal makes easy work of that, with an e-paper display that makes it plain as day how your plant is feeling. As you might expect, it features a soil moisture sensor, but what might be unexpected is that its capacitive instead of the usual resistive type. This way, no traces are exposed to the elements of plant life. It also has a BME688 sensor to monitor air quality and CO\u2082, so your plant has the chance to thrive.\nAround back youll find an ESP32-C6, an AEM10941 for solar energy harvesting, and another set of solar panels. Be sure to check out the projects GitHub if you want to learn more about this adorable and useful device.\n \n\n", "title": "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u306f\u3058\u3081\u306e\u4e00\u6b69\uff1aPlantpal\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u3001\u8c4a\u304b\u306a\u7dd1\u306e\u690d\u7269\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002Plantpal\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u690d\u7269\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u304c\u4e00\u76ee\u3067\u308f\u304b\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u571f\u58cc\u6e7f\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4e88\u60f3\u3055\u308c\u308b\u8981\u7d20\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3001\u305d\u306e\u6027\u8cea\u304c\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u3067\u3042\u308b\u5bb9\u91cf\u578b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u306f\u3058\u3081\u306e\u4e00\u6b69\uff1aPlantpal\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u690d\u7269\u306e\u4e16\u8a71\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308bPlantpal\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "\u7dd1\u306e\u690d\u7269\u3092\u5065\u5eb7\u306b\u80b2\u3066\u308b\u79d8\u8a23\uff1aPlantpal\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aPlantpal\uff1aESP32-C6\u3068\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "Plantpal\uff1a\u690d\u7269\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u3092\u7ba1\u7406\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

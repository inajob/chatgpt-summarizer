Theyre inexpensive and compact and a great choice for very small electricity needs. Their major downside is that they have a relatively high internal resistance, meaning they cant supply a lot of current for very long without decreasing the lifespan of the battery. This new integrated circuit uses a special DC-DC converter to get over that hurdle and extend the life of a coin cell significantly.\nA typical DC-DC converter uses a rapidly switching transistor to regulate the energy flow through an inductor and capacitor, effectively stepping up or stepping down the voltage. Rather than relying on a single converter, this circuit uses a two-stage system. The first is a boost converter to step the voltage from the coin cell up to as much as 11 volts to charge a storage capacitor. The second is a buck converter which steps that voltage down when there is a high current demand. This causes less overall voltage drop on the battery meaning less stress for it and a longer operating life in the device.\nThere are a few other features of this circuit as well, including an optimizer which watches the behavior of the circuit and learns about the power demands being placed on it. That way, the storage capacitor is only charged up to its maximum capacity if the optimizer determines that much charge is needed. With all of these features a coin cell could last around seven times as long as one using more traditional circuitry. If you really need to get every last bit of energy from a battery, though, you can always use a joule thief.", "title": "\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u5ef6\u3070\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u578b\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u56de\u8def\u3067\u3001DC-DC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u5ef6\u3070\u3059\u3002\u6700\u592711V\u307e\u3067\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u4e0a\u6607\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u8981\u6c42\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u4e0b\u3052\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6700\u9069\u5316\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u56de\u8def\u3088\u308a\u30827\u500d\u9577\u6301\u3061\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30d5\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u5ef6\u3070\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853", "DC-DC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u9577\u5bff\u547d\u5316", "\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u5ef6\u3070\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u6e90\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u3044\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u8981\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9"]}

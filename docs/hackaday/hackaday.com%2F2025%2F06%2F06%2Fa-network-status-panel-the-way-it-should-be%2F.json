Some MD0657C2-R LED dot matrix displays for not a lot needed a project.\nThe displays are mounted in groups of four on small PCBs, driven by a MAX6952, which are then controlled by a Pi Pico. There are several display panels in the project, each of which is a pained and laser-etched acrylic sheet with a pair of the LED boards mounted behind it. These in turn go on the front of a wooden enclosure, with a set of LED ring lights behind to illuminate the etched parts of the panels. Each display panel has its own Pico, daisy chained together and driven by a Pico W that supplies network connectivity.\nAs you might expect, this isnt the first status panel weve brought you over the years.", "title": "- LED\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u9593\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u7528\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092LED\u8868\u793a\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- LED\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- Pi Pico\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8907\u6570\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u8868\u793a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u88c5\u98fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "- MAX6952\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u3068LED\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u9b45\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u9593\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u72b6\u6cc1\u3092\u76e3\u8996\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

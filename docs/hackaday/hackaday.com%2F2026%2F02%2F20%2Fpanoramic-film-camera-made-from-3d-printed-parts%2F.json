In fact, an analog film camera (not counting the lens) can be as simple as a lightproof box and a way to activate a shutter. Knowing that, any kind of film camera could be built for any number of applications, like this 3D-printed panoramic camera from [Denis Aminev].\nThe custom-built camera works by taking a standard roll of 35mm film, which is standardized to take 36 pictures, and exposing a wider section of the film to create a panorama. This reduces the number of pictures on the roll to 19. This is the fifth version of this camera, called the Infidex 176 V, and has everything a standard film camera would have, from an exposure counter, pressure plate for the film, a winder, interchangable lenses, a viewfinder, and a tripod mounting point. It does take a bit of work to assemble, as shown in the video linked below, but the final result is impressive and delivers a custom finished product not easily found or reproducible in off-the-shelf cameras.\nThe path to creating this camera was interesting as well, as [Denis]s first custom film camera was a pinhole camera. From there he moved on to disassembling an SLR camera and attempting to reproduce all of its parts with 3D printed ones. With that in hand, he was able to modify this design into this panoramic camera which he likes because it reproduces the feel of widescreen movies. Although this camera reproduces all of the bells and whistles of a high quality analog camera, not all of these features are strictly necessary for taking pictures on film. Have a look at this minimum viable camera as well.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\uff1a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u64ae\u5f71\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3084\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4f5c\u6210\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\uff1a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u64ae\u5f71\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3055\u3068\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u64ae\u5f71\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\uff01Infidex 176 V\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3078\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

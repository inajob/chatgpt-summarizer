Now theyre all on their way home on red-eye flights and far from their benches, so spare a thought for the lonely editor holding the fort while theyve been having fun. The supply of cool hacks for your entertainment must continue, so whats to be done? Fortunately Hackaday writer [Anne Ogborn] has the answer, in the form of an automated Hackaday article generator.\nWe once had a commenter make a withering insult that one of our contributors writing styles looked like the work of an AI driven bot, a sentence that the writer in question treasures enough to have incorporated in their Hackaday email signature. [Anne] is a data scientist and Prolog programmer by trade so knows a bit about AI, and she has no need for such frippery. Instead shes made a deck of cards each marked with a common theme among the work featured here, and generating new article titles is a simple case of drawing cards from the pack and assembling the resulting sentence.\nThe result is both amusing and we think, uncannily on the mark. Who wouldnt want an ESP8266 powered cardboard drone? We think it will make a valuable addition to the Hackaday armoury, to be brought out on days such as the first of April, when theres always an unexpected shortage of hacks. Video below the break.\n\n"}

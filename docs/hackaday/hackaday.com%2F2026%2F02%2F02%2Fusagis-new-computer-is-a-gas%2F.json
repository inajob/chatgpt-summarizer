He picked up a Motorola 68000 based machine at a local swap meet.\u00a0 A few boards, a backplane, and a power supply. The only information provided is the machines original purpose: gas station pump control.\nThe computer in question is an embedded system. It uses a VME backplane, and all the cards are of the 3u variaety. The 68k and associated support chips are on one card.\u00a0 Memory is on another.\u00a0 A third card contains four serial ports. The software lives across three different EPROM chips. Time for a bit of reverse engineering!\n\n[Dave] quickly dumped the ROMs and looked for strings. Since the 68k is a big endian machine, some byte swapping was required to get things human readable. Once byte swapped, huge tables of human readable strings revealed themselves, including an OS version. The computer runs pSOS, an older 68k based real time operating system  exactly what one would expect a machine from the 80s to run.\nThe next step was to give it some power and see if the gas station computer would pump once again.\u00a0 The LEDs lit up, and a repeating signal showed up from one of the serial ports. The serial connections on this machine are RS-485.\u00a0 Not common for home computers, but used quite a bit in industrial embedded systems.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the machine wouldnt respond to commands sent from a terminal. The communication protocol remained a mystery.\nSince this video has gone up though, several people have provided a wealth of information at the vintage-micros channel over on [Daves] Usagi Electric Discord.\nGas pumps are a bit of a departure from [Daves] usual minicomputer work. Were no strangers to embedded systems here though.\n", "title": "\u300c\u30e2\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e968000\u642d\u8f09\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u300d", "body": "Dave\u306f\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u306e\u30e2\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e968000\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3057\u3001\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u4fe1\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30e2\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e968000\u642d\u8f09\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u300d", "\u300c\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u5236\u5fa1\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u300d", "\u300c\u30ec\u30c8\u30edOS pSOS\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d", "\u300c\u901a\u4fe1\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u8b0e\uff1a\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u6790\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff1a\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u8d77\u52d5\u300d"]}

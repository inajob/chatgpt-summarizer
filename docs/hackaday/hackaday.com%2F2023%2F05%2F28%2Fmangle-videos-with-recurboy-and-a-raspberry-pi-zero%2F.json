Now you can do it all with a Raspberry Pi Zero and [cyberboy666]\u2019s recurBOY. And if you missed out on the 1970\u2019s video-editing psychedelia, now\u2019s your chance to catch up \u2013 recurBOY is a modern video synth with all of the bells and whistles, and it\u2019ll fit in your pocket. Check out [cyberboy666]\u2019s demo video if you don\u2019t yet know what you\u2019re getting into. (Embedded below.)\nRecurBOY has four modes: video, shader, effects, and external input, and each of these is significantly cooler than the previous. Video mode plays videos straight off of the SD card through the recurBOY\u2019s composite video out. Shader mode lets you program your own shaders using the GLES shader dialect for resource-constrained devices. And this is where the various knobs and buttons come in. You can program the various shader routines to read any of the pots as input, allowing you to tweak the graphics demos on the fly.\nEffects mode overlays your shaders on the video that\u2019s playing, and external mode allows you to plug in a USB video capture card or a webcam so you can do all that same mangling with a live camera feed. And these two modes are where it gets awesome. The shader effects in the demo video cover all of the analog classics \u2013 including bloom and RGB separation \u2013 but also some distinctly digital effects. And again, you can tweak them all live with the knobs. Or plug in a MIDI controller and control it all externally. What hasnt he thought of?\nOld school analog video effects are really fun, and recurBOY brings them to you with the flexibility of modern shader coding. What\u2019s not to love? If you want to see the pinnacle of the pre-digital era, that would be the Scanimate. For a video synth that integrates with your audio synth, check out Hypno. And if glitching the video is more your style, you can hijack the RAM of a VGA/composite converter.\nTrippy, man!\n\n\nvia Adafruit."}

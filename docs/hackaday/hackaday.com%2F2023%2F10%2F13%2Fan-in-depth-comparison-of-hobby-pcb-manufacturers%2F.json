After receiving the boards, he analyzed the results and produced an interesting analysis.\nThe project he is working on is Sir-Box-A-Lot, a Sokoban gaming console clone that weve covered before. It uses an AVR128DA28 microcontroller to emulate the original box-pushing game\u00a0and drive the OLED display. He ordered PCBs from OSHPark, DigiKey Red, JLCPCB, PCBWay and Aisler.\nOSHPark boards are gorgeous, but you pay for it.\nThere were pros and cons for each of the services: OSHPark produced the nicest-looking boards, but at the highest cost. DigiKey Red had a flawless solder mask, but a rather sloppy-looking silkscreen and shipped the boards covered in adhesive gunk. JLCPCB was fast, shipping the boards in less than 7 days, but the smaller details of the silkscreen were blurry and the solder mask was thinner than the others. The solder mask from PCBWay was very slightly misaligned but was thicker than most, and they were the only ones who queried a badly shaped hole to see what [Icamtuf] wanted to do: the others just made assumptions and made the boards without checking.\nTo be fair, this analysis is based on a single PCB design ordered once, and it is possible that some companies were having a bad day. So, there are no clear winners and I wouldnt make a choice based on this alone. But the analysis is well worth a read if you want to know what to look out for on your own PCBs.", "title": "\u8907\u6570\u306e\u4f4e\u51fa\u529bPCB\u88fd\u9020\u4f1a\u793e\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fPCB\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5206\u6790", "body": "[Icamtuf]\u306f\u4f4e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306ePCB\u88fd\u9020\u4f1a\u793e\u304b\u3089PCB\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5206\u6790\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5404\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306b\u306f\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6b20\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002OSHPark\u306f\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u304c\u6700\u3082\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002DigiKey Red\u306f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u5b8c\u74a7\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u96d1\u3067\u3001\u63a5\u7740\u5264\u307e\u307f\u308c\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002JLCPCB\u306f\u8fc5\u901f\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u7d30\u90e8\u304c\u307c\u3084\u3051\u3001\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3082\u4ed6\u306e\u4f1a\u793e\u3088\u308a\u8584\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002PCBWay\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u306f\u308f\u305a\u304b\u306b\u305a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u4f1a\u793e\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u554f\u984c\u306e\u3042\u308b\u7a74\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u3092\u5c0b\u306d\u305f\u3002\u4e00\u3064\u306ePCB\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u5206\u6790\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u660e\u78ba\u306a\u52dd\u8005\u306f\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u306ePCB\u3067\u4f55\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u304b\u77e5\u308a\u305f\u3044\u5834\u5408\u306b\u306f\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u5206\u6790\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u8907\u6570\u306e\u4f4e\u51fa\u529bPCB\u88fd\u9020\u4f1a\u793e\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fPCB\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5206\u6790", "Sir-Box-A-Lot\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308bPCB\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u5206\u6790", "PCB\u88fd\u9020\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u9078\u629e\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6b20\u70b9\u306e\u5206\u6790", "OSHPark\u3001DigiKey Red\u3001JLCPCB\u3001PCBWay\u3001Aisler\u304b\u3089\u306ePCB\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "PCB\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u7d44\u7acb\u3068\u88fd\u9020\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u8a73\u7d30\u306e\u5206\u6790"]}

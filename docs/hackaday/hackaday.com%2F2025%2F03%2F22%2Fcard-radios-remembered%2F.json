In the 1980s we had a bewildering array of oddball gadgets and exciting new tech. But as kids we didnt have money to buy a lot of what we saw. But he had a \u00a35 note burning a hole in his pocket from Christmas and found a Casio RD-10 card radio on sale and grabbed it. Hes long-ago lost that one, but he was able to find a new old stock one and shows us the little gadget in the video below.\nThe card-thin (1.9 mm) FM radio had many odd features, especially for the 1980s. For one thing, it took a coin cell, which was exotic in those days. The headphones had a special flat connector that reminded us of an automotive fuse. Even the idea of an earbud was odd at that time.\n\nIt was a good idea not to lose the earbud, as it had that strange connector. The earbud worked as the antenna and power switch, too. Oddly enough, you could get a slightly fatter AM radio version, and they even made one that was AM and FM. Unsurprisingly, Casio even made a version with a calculator built-in. It had a solar cell, but that only powers the calculator. You still needed the coin cell for the radio.\nThe sound? Meh. But what did you expect? There was a stereo version, too. However, that one had a rechargeable battery, which was not in good health after a few decades. He also shows a Sony card radio that is a bit different. We were hoping for a teardown, especially of the rechargeable since it was toast, anyway, but for now, well have to imagine whats inside.\nWe love nostalgic radios, although usually they are a little older. We miss the days when a kid might think it was cool to see an ad touting: Oh boy! Were radio engineers!\n", "title": "- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30ab\u30b7\u30aaRD-10\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7279\u7570\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30a8\u30a2\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u304c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3082\u517c\u306d\u308b\uff01\u7570\u8272\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3068\u305d\u306e\u97f3\u8cea", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u96fb\u6c60\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3068\u5947\u629c\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u305f\u3061"]}

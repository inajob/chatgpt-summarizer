In the 1980s we had a bewildering array of oddball gadgets and exciting new tech. But as kids we didnt have money to buy a lot of what we saw. But he had a \u00a35 note burning a hole in his pocket from Christmas and found a Casio RD-10 card radio on sale and grabbed it. Hes long-ago lost that one, but he was able to find a new old stock one and shows us the little gadget in the video below.\nThe card-thin (1.9 mm) FM radio had many odd features, especially for the 1980s. For one thing, it took a coin cell, which was exotic in those days. The headphones had a special flat connector that reminded us of an automotive fuse. Even the idea of an earbud was odd at that time.\n\nIt was a good idea not to lose the earbud, as it had that strange connector. The earbud worked as the antenna and power switch, too. Oddly enough, you could get a slightly fatter AM radio version, and they even made one that was AM and FM. Unsurprisingly, Casio even made a version with a calculator built-in. It had a solar cell, but that only powers the calculator. You still needed the coin cell for the radio.\nThe sound? Meh. But what did you expect? There was a stereo version, too. However, that one had a rechargeable battery, which was not in good health after a few decades. He also shows a Sony card radio that is a bit different. We were hoping for a teardown, especially of the rechargeable since it was toast, anyway, but for now, well have to imagine whats inside.\nWe love nostalgic radios, although usually they are a little older. We miss the days when a kid might think it was cool to see an ad touting: Oh boy! Were radio engineers!\n"}

Apparently, your sense of smell lives in your olfactory bulb, and no one, until now, has thought to try zapping it with ultrasound to see what happens.\nThe bulb is somewhere behind your nose, as you might expect. This is sub-optimal for ultrasound because your nose isnt flat, and it is full of air. Packing a subjects nose with gel wasnt going to win many fans. The answer was to place the transducer on the persons forehead and shoot down at the bulb. They made a custom headset that let them precisely target areas of the subjects bulb guided by an MRI.\nSo far, they have a sample size of two, but theyve managed to induce the smell of fresh air, garbage, ozone, and burning wood. What would you do with this? Smell-o-vision? A garbage truck VR game? Let us know in the comments. We dont think this is exactly how the last VR smell gadget we saw worked, but  honestly  we arent completely sure."}

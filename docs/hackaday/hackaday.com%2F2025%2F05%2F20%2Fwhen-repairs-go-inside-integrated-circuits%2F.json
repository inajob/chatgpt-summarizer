Your IC got too hot and internal wiring has come loose. You could replace the IC, sure. But what if the IC contains encryption secrets? Then you would be forced to grind back the epoxy and fix those open circuits yourself. That is, if youre skilled enough!\nIn this video our hacker [YCS] fixes a Mercedes-Benz encryption chip from an electronic car key. First, the black epoxy surface is polished off, all the way back to the PCB with a very fine gradient. As the gold threads begin to be visible we need to slow down and be very careful.\nThe repair job is to reconnect the PCB points with the silicon body inside the chip. The PCB joints arent as delicate and precious as the silicon body points, those are the riskiest part. If you make a mistake with those then repair will be impossible. Then you tin the pads using solder for the PCB points and pure tin and hot air for the silicon body points.\nOnce thats done you can use fine silver wire to join the points. If testing indicates success then you can complete the job with glue to hold the new wiring in place. Everything is easy when you know how!\nDoes repair work get more dangerous and fiddly than this? Well, sometimes.\n\n\nThanks to [J. Peterson] for this tip.", "title": "- IC\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u56de\u8def\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "IC\u306e\u56de\u8def\u304c\u958b\u3044\u3066\u4fee\u7406\u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3001\u5c01\u5370\u3092\u5265\u304c\u3057\u4fee\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- IC\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u56de\u8def\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30e1\u30eb\u30bb\u30c7\u30b9\u30fb\u30d9\u30f3\u30c4\u306e\u6697\u53f7\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3092\u524a\u308a\u53d6\u3063\u3066IC\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u7e4a\u7d30\u306a\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u4f53\u3092\u6271\u3046\u969b\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "- \u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306e\u7dca\u5f35\u611f\u3042\u3075\u308c\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u4f5c\u696d"]}

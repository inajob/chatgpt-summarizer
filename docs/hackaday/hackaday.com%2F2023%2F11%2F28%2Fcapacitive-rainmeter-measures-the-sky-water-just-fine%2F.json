There are a bunch of ways to go about it, and this capacitive rainmeter solution from [Magnus Thome] might just be the perfect solution youre looking for.\nLike many who came before, [Magnus] had experimented with traditional resistive-based sensors using copper traces to measure water levels. As the soil moisture measuring set learned as well, corrosion tends to promise a pretty short life for these designs. Capacitive sensors, on the other hand, can be isolated from the water itself, and thus sense the levels without being subject to such degradation.\n[Magnus] pairs the off-the-shelf capacitive sensor with an ESP32 charged with reading it and reporting back to Home Assistant. Its also outfitted with a heater to keep it at a constant temperature to avoid it freezing over during those cold and snowy Swedish winters.\nIts a tidy way to integrate a quality commercial sensor with a DIY smart home setup. If youve been whipping up your own neat sensor networks for your smart home, dont hesitate to let us know.

The drive flops around on the end of its tether and gets in the way, so they repurposed their old iPod pouch and attached it to the laptop lid with double-sided tape. You can guess how that went  the weight of the drive caused the pocket to sag and eventually detach over time.\nThen [samsuksiri] remembered that they had LEGO DOTS patch stashed somewhere. Its an 88 plate with adhesive on the back so you can build almost anywhere. Then the problem was this: how to attach LEGO to the drive itself? Youd think this is where the hot glue comes in, but that didnt work because the drive is too slippery.\nNothing worked, really  not until [samsuksiri] flipped the drive over to work with the dimpled side that has un-coated plastic. Finally, the answer turned out to be mounting tape. Now, [samsuksiri] can attach the drive in any orientation, or even attach a second drive. Be sure to check it out after the break.\nLooking for slightly more astounding LEGO creations?

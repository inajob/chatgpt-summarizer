(Credit: [Gregulations], YouTube)Among all the amazing technologies that were promised to us, there is one that is much more egregious than the lack of flying cars and real hovering hoverboards: the lack of fully automated breakfast-maker machines. Instead we find ourselves handling the same dumb appliances each morning as we make a healthy breakfast that we then have time to wolf down before rushing out of the door to still be a few minutes late for work. When [Greg] researched machines that could automatically prepare breakfast, he came up empty, which led him down the rabbit hole of the Autochef-9000.\nAlthough often featured in movies  ranging from Back to the Future to Wallace and Gromit  the contraptions in those are rarely practical, and real-life attempts often suffer the problem of feature creep as they have to handle too many ingredients and operations. This is where [Greg] found redemption in the simplicity of a proper British breakfast: beans, toast, sausages (sossys), and eggs. Months of CAD, welding, breadboarding, and writing Arduino code later, he made a machine that can open a can of beans, toast bread, boil eggs, fry up sausages, and deposit it all on a plate, all ready for that morning breakfast first thing when you stroll into the kitchen.\nThanks to [htky] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u671d\u98df\u4f5c\u308a\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff1aAutochef-9000\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u671d\u98df\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4e0d\u5728\u306f\u3001\u6620\u753b\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\u7aef\u6b63\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u3068\u306f\u88cf\u8179\u306b\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u306f\u6a5f\u80fd\u904e\u5270\u304c\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3002[Greg]\u6c0f\u306f\u3001CAD\u3001\u6eb6\u63a5\u3001Arduino\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u7d4c\u3066\u82f1\u56fd\u98a8\u306e\u671d\u98df\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u671d\u98df\u4f5c\u308a\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff1aAutochef-9000\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u671d\u98df\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u671d\u98df\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u671d\u98df\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eCAD\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068Arduino\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "\u82f1\u56fd\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u671d\u98df\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3"]}

This week, were opening up the workshops. The workshops are small, hands-on opportunities to build something or learn something, lead by an expert in the field. Workshops sell out fast, so register now if youre interested.\nAnd stay tuned for the next round of talk reveals next week! And maybe even the badge reveal?\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Geppert\nWeave Your Own Core Memory  Core16!\nThis workshop provides you with the opportunity to weave your own core memory! Using 16 authentic ferrite core bits and 16 RGB LEDs, you can play tic-tac-toe, paint with a magnetic stylus, and create your own interactive experiences. Andy Geppert will guide you through the assembly of Core16. The Core16 kit is the little brother of the Core64 kit. The smaller Core16 kit reduces assembly time/cost, enabling more people to experience the challenge and satisfaction of creating their own core memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravis Foss\nPresented by DigiKey: Introduction and expansion of the XRP Robotics Platform\nIn this workshop you will be able to get your hands on the new XRP (Experiential Robotics Platform) and take the basics a step further with a few additional parts. Along with the base kit, participants will have the opportunity to install a RGB twist encoder, a LCD screen, and a buzzer to create a setup that will allow the user to choose a program onboard without being tethered to a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky Button\nHow to Make a Custom Guitar Pedal\nMusical effects are for everybody! Join this workshop and get hands-on experience assembling and programming your musical effects pedals.

For those with an interest in intellectual property and the public domain it brings another treat, because every January 1st a fresh crop of works enter the public domain.\nWell take a look at the wider crop around the day, but this year the big story is that Mickey Mouse, whose first outing was in 1928s Steamboat Willie, is to get his turn to be released from copyright. [Jennifer Jenkins] from Duke Universitys Center for the Study of the Public Domain, is using Mickeys impending release to take a look at the law surrounding such a well-protected work.\nMickey has perhaps the greatest symbolism of all intellectual property when it comes to copyright terms, having been the reason for the Disney Corporations successive successful attempts to have copyright terms extended. Now even their reach is about to come to an end, but beware if youre about to use him in your work, for the Mickey entering the public domain is an early outing, without gloves or the colours and eyes of his later incarnations. Added to that, Disney have a range of trademarks surrounding him. The piece makes for an interesting read as it navigates this maze, and makes some worthwhile points about copyright and the public domain.\nLast year, we welcomed Fritz Langs Metropolis to the public domain. Meanwhile if youre reading this in 2023, we believe our use of a header image featuring the 1928 Mickey to be covered by the doctrine of fair use."}

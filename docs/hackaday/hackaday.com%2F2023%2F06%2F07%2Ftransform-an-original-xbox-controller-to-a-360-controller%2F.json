They might not be perfect, but theyre fairly well-made, not particularly expensive, use standard USB and Bluetooth interfaces, and even have decent support in the open-source community. So if youre gaming on Linux or working on any other kind of retro gaming rig itll likely be plug-and-play.\nThis wasnt the case with the first generation Xbox controller, though, and although its proprietary connector was actually using USB, the controller scheme wasnt as open. This is [Tom]s effort of upcycling his original Xbox controller to work indistinguishably from a stock Xbox 360 controller.\nFor those asking why anyone would want to do this, [Tom] is actually one of the few who enjoyed the original bulky Xbox Duke controller that released with the console in 2001. It wasnt a popular choice in the larger gaming community and a year later Microsoft released a smaller version, but we all have our quirks. A Teensy 4.1 is attached to the end of the controller cable and acts as an intermediary to intercept the proprietary signalling coming from this controller and convert it into something usable. Since the controller doesnt even show up as a standard USB HID device it took a little more sniffing of the protocol to decipher what was going on at all, but eventually some help was found within this other driver that gave [Tom] the clues he needed to get it working.\nThere were some other headaches to this project as well, especially since USB debugging USB connections while using USB isnt exactly a streamlined process, but after a couple of breakthroughs the Teensy pass-through interface began working and [Tom] can use his controller of choice across multiple platforms now. If youre looking to upgrade in other ways take a look at this build which seeks to recalibrate, rather than replace, an older Xbox controller experiencing drift on its analog control sticks.\n\n"}

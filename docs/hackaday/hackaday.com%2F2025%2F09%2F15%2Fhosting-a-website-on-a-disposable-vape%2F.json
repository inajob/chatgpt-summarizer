To prove the point of how capable these electronics have become, [BogdanTheGeek] decided to turn one of these vapes into a webserver, appropriately called the vapeserver.\nWhile tearing apart some of the fancier adult pacifiers, [Bogdan] discovered that a number of them feature Puya MCUs, which is a name that some of our esteemed readers may recognize from cheapest MCU articles. The target vape has a Puya PY32F002B MCU, which comes with a Cortex-M0+ core at 24 MHz, 3 kB SRAM and 24 kB of Flash. All of which now counts as disposable in 2025, it would appear.\nEven with a fairly perky MCU, running a webserver with these specs would seem to be a fools errand. Getting around the limited hardware involved using the uIP TCP/IP stack, and using SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol), along with semihosting to create a serial device that the OS can use like one would a modem and create a visible IP address with the webserver.\nThe URL to the vapeserver is contained in the article and on the GitHub project page, but out of respect for not melting it down with an unintended DDoS, it isnt linked here. You are of course totally free to replicate the effort on a disposable adult pacifier of your choice, or other compatible MCU.", "title": "\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066 vape \u3092 web \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001Web\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u300cvapeserver\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fdMCU\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002", "titles": ["\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066 vape \u3092 web \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "Puya MCU \u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066 vape \u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528", "uIP TCP/IP \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc", "\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u518d\u767a\u898b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

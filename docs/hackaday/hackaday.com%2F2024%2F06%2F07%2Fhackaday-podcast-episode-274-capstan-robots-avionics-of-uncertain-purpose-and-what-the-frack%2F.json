They were all topics Hackaday editors Elliot Williams and Al Williams found fascinating this week. If you wonder what makes an electrical ground a ground, or what a theodolite is, you should check it out.\nThis week, the hacks came fast and furious. Capstans, instead of gears, work well for 3D-printed mechanisms, a PI Pico can directly receive radio signals, and the guys saw a number of teardowns and reverse engineering triumphs. Youll also find solid-state heat pumps, flying wings, spectroscopy, and more.\nThe cant miss articles this week? Learn about theodolites, a surveying feat from ancient Greece, and how fracking works.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what weve mispronounced  or any other thoughts on the episode  in the comments!\n\nDownload an archival copy for your personal collection.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 274 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Supercon 2024 Call For Participation: We Want You!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Ferric Bueler] for identifying last weeks sound, which was the XDR cassette code.

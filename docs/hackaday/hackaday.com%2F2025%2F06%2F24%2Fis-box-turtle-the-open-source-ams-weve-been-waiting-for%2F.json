[Daniel]s latest Mod Bot video on the Box Turtle MMU (embedded below) highlights an open source project that aims to bring the power and ease of AMS to Voron printers, and everyone else using Klipper willing to put in the work.\nThis isnt a torture test, but its very clean and very cute.\nThe system itself is a mostly 3D printed unit that sits atop [Daniel]s Voron printer looking just like an AMS atop a BambuLab. It has space for four spools, with motorized rollers and feeders in the front that have handy-dandy indicator LEDs to tell you which filament is loaded or printing. Each spool gets its own extruder, whose tension can be adjusted manually via thumbscrew. A buffer unit sits between the spool box and your toolhead.\nAside from the box, you need to spec a toolhead that meets requirements. It needs a PTFE connector with a (reverse) boden tube to guide the filament, and it also needs to have a toolhead filament runout sensor. The sensor is to provide feedback to Klipper that the filament is loaded or unloaded. Finally you will probably want to add a filament cutter, because that happens at the toolhead with this unit.\u00a0 Sure, you could try the whole tip-forming thing, but anyone who had a Prusa MMU back in the day can tell you that is easier said than done. The cutter apparently makes this system much more reliable.\nIn operation, it looks just like a BambuLabs printer with an AMS installed. The big difference, again, is that this project by [Armored Turtle] is fully open source, with everything on GitHub under a GPL-3.0 license. Several vendors are already producing kits; [Daniel] is using the LDO version in his video.\nIt looks like the project is well documentedand [Mod Bot] agrees, and he reports that the build process is not terribly difficult (well, if youre the kind of person who builds a Voron, anyway), and adding the AFC Klipper Addon (also by [Armored Turtle]) was easy as pie. After that, well. It needs calibration. Calibration and lots of tuning, which is an ongoing process for [Daniel]. If you want to see that, watch the video below, but well spoil it for you and let you know it really pays off. (Except for lane 4, where he probably needs to clean up the print.)Weve featured open-source MMUs before, like the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder, but its great to see more in this scene, especially something that looks like it can take on the AMS. Its not the only way to get multimaterial theres always tool-changers, or you could just put in a second motion system and gantry.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01Voron\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002Voron\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01Voron\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8", "- BambuLabs\u306eAMS\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01Box Turtle MMU\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u5370\u5237\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- Voron\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u5370\u5237\uff1a\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "- \u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9MMU\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8"]}

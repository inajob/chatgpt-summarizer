Their outlet strips built quickly get crowded with wall-warts, and why bother converting from DC to AC only to convert back again?\nThis common conundrum is the inspiration for [Walker]s DC UPS design, which has some interesting features. First off, the design is open source, which of course invites tinkering and repurposing. The UPS is built for a 12 volt supply and load, but that obviously can be changed to suit your needs. The battery bank is a 4S3P design using 18650 cells, and that could be customized as well. Theres an ideal diode controller that prevents DC from back-feeding into the supply when the lights go out, and a really interesting synchronous buck-boost converter in place of the power management chip youd normally see in a UPS. The converter chip takes a PWM signal from an RP2040; theres also an ESP32 onboard for web server and UI duties as well as an STM32 to run the BMS. The video below discusses the design and shows a little of the build.\nWeve seen a spate of DC UPS designs lately, some more elaborate than others. This one has quite a few interesting chips that most of us dont normally deal with, and its nice to see how theyre used in a practical design.\n\n", "title": "12\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306eDC UPS\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3068\u8ca0\u8377\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5cDC UPS\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u304f\u3001\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u300212V\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001PWM\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["12\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306eDC UPS\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3068\u8ca0\u8377\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDC UPS\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u597d\u307f\u306b\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u4ed8\u304d", "\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306aDC UPS\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316", "DC UPS\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a2d\u8a08\uff1aPWM\u4fe1\u53f7\u3068ESP32\u642d\u8f09\u306eWeb\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u4fbf\u5229", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306aDC UPS\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9"]}

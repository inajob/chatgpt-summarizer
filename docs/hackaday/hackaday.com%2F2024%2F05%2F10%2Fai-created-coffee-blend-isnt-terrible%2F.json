Heres something to make the single-origin bean snobs chew their espresso cups: an artisan roastery in Helsinki is offering a coffee blend created by artificial intelligence called AI-conic. The idea, of course, is that technology will lighten the workload needed to produce coffee.\nThis is an interesting development because Finland consumes the most coffee in the world, according to the International Coffee Organization. Coffee roasting is a highly-valued traditional artisan profession there, so it stands to reason that they might turn to technology for help.\nJust like with scotch whisky, theres nothing wrong with coffee blends outright. Bean blends are good for consistency, when you want every cup to taste pretty much exactly the same. Single-origin beans, though, are traceable to one location, and as a result, they usually have a distinct flavor based on the climate theyre grown in.\nIf youre new to coffee, blends are a nice, safe way to start out. And, interestingly, the AI chose to make the blend out of four different types of beans instead of the usual two or three, despite being tasked with creating a blend that would suit the palates of coffee enthusiasts. But the coffee experts agreed that the AI blend was perfect and needed no human intervention. We probably wont be getting to Finland anytime soon, so if you try it, let us know how it tastes!\nDo you like cold brew? How would you like to be able to brew some in just three minutes?", "title": "\u30d8\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30ad\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b6\u30f3\u7119\u714e\u6240\u304cAI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u300cAI-conic\u300d\u3092\u5c0e\u5165", "body": "\u30d8\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30ad\u306e\u8077\u4eba\u7119\u714e\u6240\u304c\u3001AI\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u300cAI-conic\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u6700\u3082\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u6d88\u8cbb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002AI\u304c4\u3064\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u8c46\u304b\u3089\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u306fAI\u306e\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u304c\u5b8c\u74a7\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8a8d\u3081\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d8\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30ad\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b6\u30f3\u7119\u714e\u6240\u304cAI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u300cAI-conic\u300d\u3092\u5c0e\u5165", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u306e\u751f\u7523\u91cf\u304c\u6700\u3082\u591a\u3044\u7406\u7531", "\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f4\u3064\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u8c46\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306bAI\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9", "3\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u65b0\u6280\u8853"]}

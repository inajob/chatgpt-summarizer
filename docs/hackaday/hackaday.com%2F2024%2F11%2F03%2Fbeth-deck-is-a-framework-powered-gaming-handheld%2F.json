[Beth Le] now brings us a custom handheld for the beginner that can be assembled in 15 minutes and doesnt require any soldering.\nThese claims might seem suspicious at first, but the fact that the build is powered by a Framework mainboard makes the dream seem attainable. Using an 8 touchscreen and a rehoused mobile device controller, the 3D printed enclosure turns the PCB and battery into an interesting alternative to a Steam Deck.\n[Beth] recommends waiting for the forthcoming revision 2 to make your own as she is working on refining the model. She also suggests printing in PC or PETG since PLA is too brittle and ABS warping can be an issue for tolerances with the pogo pins. In any case, this is definitely a project to keep your eye on if you enjoy gaming on the go.\nAs you know, we love Framework around here and the Cambrian Explosion of high-powered custom builds its enabled. This isnt the first time weve seen a Framework-Powered handheld either. If youre looking for a different form factor, weve also seen portable all-in-ones, keyboard PCs, and slabtops too."}

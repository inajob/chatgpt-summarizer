The goal is typically to get the machine as close to its original state as possible, except for perhaps a few non-intrusive mods like memory upgrades. [Drygol] however, had already done this so many times that he thought it was time to take a different route for once, and apply some creativity to an old Amiga 500 case. Originalists may shudder, but we quite like his funky blue-and-yellow A500 mod.\nMissing keys, random stickers and an ugly paint job: the A500 wasnt looking great at the beginning\nTo be fair, [Drygol] wasnt the first one to modify this specific Amigas case: one of its previous owners had already applied a rather shoddy blue paint job and defaced it with some stickers. [Drygol] decided to stick with the basic idea, but do it right this time. First he removed the old paint using concentrated lye, then gave it a fresh coat of blue. He also applied glow-in-the-dark paint to the Amiga logo embossed in the case and added a fluorescent yellow laser-cut circuit board ornament. It took a bit of experimenting to get all these elements just right, but the end result definitely looks the part.\nThe insides of the Amiga also needed some TLC: [Drygol] competely cleaned and lubricated the floppy drive, gave the motherboard a good ultrasonic scrub, and replaced dodgy capacitors all over. He expanded the RAM from 512 kB to 1 MB and added a Gotek floppy emulator, which can work in parallel with the original disk drive. To make the Gotek easy to operate, [Drygol] placed its OLED screen and a pair of touch-sensitive buttons in a cutout on the front of the case.\nA matching blue mouse and gamepad, both connected through the MouSTer adapter, complete the setup. The result is a good-looking A500 with some modern conveniences thats perfect for exploring the Amigas extensive software library. If custom colors arent your thing, youll be happy to know that the original shade of grey or beige might be available for your retro console, too.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u6539\u9020: \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u3068\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc\u306e\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u5916\u89b3", "body": "\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044Amiga 500\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u5275\u9020\u6027\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u9664\u304d\u3001\u9752\u3067\u5857\u308a\u76f4\u3057\u3001\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b6\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u3082\u4fee\u5fa9\u3057\u3001RAM\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u9752\u3044\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3082\u4ed8\u5c5e\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u6539\u9020: \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u3068\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc\u306e\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u5916\u89b3", "\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3067\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u751f\u547d\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b", "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u306e\u6539\u9020\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3082\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9: \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u306a\u3069", "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u3068\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9: \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u5229\u4fbf\u6027\u3068\u5171\u306b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\u3092", "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac500\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u5916\u89b3\u3068\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u306e\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9"]}

If you dont remember records at all, you are even younger. But there was a time when audio records were not flat  they were drums, which was how the original Edison phonograph worked. [Our Own Devices] did a video earlier showing one of these devices, but since it was in a museum, he didnt get to open it up. Lucky for us, he now has one of his own, and we get to see inside in the video below.\nIronically, Edison was deaf yet still invented the phonograph. While he did create the working phonograph  his self-identified most important invention  the original invention wasnt commercially viable. You could record and playback audio on tin foil wrapped around a drum. But you couldnt remove the foil without destroying it.\n\nEdison was busy, but another inventor related to Bell created a similar system that used wax cylinders instead of foil. Edisons vision for his invention didnt include popular music, which hurt sales.\nIf you want to skip the history lesson  although it is well worth watching  you can skip to the 9-minute mark. You can hear the machine play and then see the box come off.\nOddly, people were recording things before they were able to play them back. Keeping a machine like this running can be quite a challenge.\n"}

Its really quite cool, with a KVM switch and picture-by-picture support for two inputs at the same time. The only downside is that control is limited to a tiny joystick hiding behind the bezel. Its such a pain to use that [Jon] doesnt even use all of the features available.\n[Jon] tried ddcutil, but ultimately it didnt work out. Enter the rack-mounted custom controller keyboard, a solution which gives [Jon] single keypress control of adjusting the brightness up and down, toggling picture-by-picture mode, changing source, and more.\nHow does it work? It uses the display data channel (DDC), which is an I\u00b2C bus on the monitors HDMI connector. More specifically, it has a PIC18 microcontroller sending those commands via eight Cherry MX-style blues.\nCheck this out  [Jon] isnt even wasting one of the four monitor inputs because this build uses an HDMI through port. The finished build looks exquisite and fits right into the rack with its CNC-routed aluminium front panel. Be sure to check it out in action after the break.\nEver wonder how given keyboard registers the key youre pressing? Heres a brief history of keyboard encoding.\n\n"}

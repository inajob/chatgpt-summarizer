Conditions like macular degeneration (which causes loss of central vision) are more accurately simulated by using eye tracking, a technology much more mature nowadays than it was even just a few years ago.\nThe abstract for the presentation is available here, and if you have some time be sure to check out the main index for all of the VR research demos because there are some neat ones there, including a method of manipulating a users perception of the shape of the ground under their feet by electrically-stimulating the tendons of the ankle.\nEye tracking is in a few consumer VR products nowadays, but its also perfectly feasible to roll your own in a surprisingly slick way. Its even been used on jumping spiders to gain insights into the fascinating and surprisingly deep perceptual reality these creatures inhabit."}

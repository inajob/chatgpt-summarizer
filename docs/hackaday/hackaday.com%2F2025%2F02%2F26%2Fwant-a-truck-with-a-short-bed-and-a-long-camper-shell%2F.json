To combat this problem, [Eds Garage] built a camper shell that extends once youve arrived at your campsite.\n[Ed] wanted to keep things relatively low profile while still tall enough to sit up in for convenience, leading to a small bit of the shell peeking over the trucks roof. To keep the cold Canadian winter out, attention was paid to proper weather sealing around the sliding portion of the shell so that it stays warm and dry inside.\nWhile this would work on any truck, the mains power plugs in the bed of some modern trucks mean that certain glamping conveniences like a heater and projector can be easily powered while youre in camp. We get to see the camper shell in action at the end of the video where the pros and cons of having your sleeping space also being your storage while\u00a0en route become apparent.\nIf youre looking for something a little less conventional for your camping experience, how about this solar camper or this retro bike camper?\n\n", "title": "- \u4f38\u7e2e\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u304c\u62e1\u5f35\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u5bd2\u3055\u5bfe\u7b56\u3082\u65bd\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4f38\u7e2e\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u5bd2\u3055\u5bfe\u7b56\u3082\u30d0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ea\uff01\u5929\u5019\u5bc6\u9589\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb", "- \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306e\u4f4e\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb", "- \u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u53ce\u7d0d\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u3084\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u3082\u63d0\u6848\uff01"]}

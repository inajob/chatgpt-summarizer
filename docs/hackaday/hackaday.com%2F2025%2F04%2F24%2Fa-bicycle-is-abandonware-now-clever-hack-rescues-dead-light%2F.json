Clever Hack Rescues Dead Light", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2025/04/24/a-bicycle-is-abandonware-now-clever-hack-rescues-dead-light/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vanmoof-light-featured.jpg", "original_content": "A bicycle is perhaps one of the most repairable pieces of equipment one can own  no matter whats wrong with it, and wherever you are on the planet, youll be able to find somebody to fix your bike without too much trouble. Unfortunately as electric bikes become more popular, predatory manufacturers are doing everything they can to turn a bike into a closed machine, only serviceable by them.\nThats bad enough, but its even worse if the company happens to go under. As an example, [Fransisco] has a bike built by a company that has since gone bankrupt. He doesnt name them, but it looks like a VanMoof to us. The bike features a light built into the front of the top tube of the frame, which if you can believe it, can only be operated by the companys (now nonfunctional) cloud-based app.\nThe hack is relatively straightforward. The panel for the VanMoof electronics is removed and the works underneath are slid up the tube, leaving the connector to the front light. An off the shelf USB-C Li-Po charger and a small cell take the place of the original parts under a new 3D printed panel with a switch to run the light via a suitable resistor. If it wasnt for the startling green color of the filament he used, you might not even know it wasnt original.\nWe would advise anyone who will listen, that hardware which relies on an app and a cloud service should be avoided at all costs. We know most Hackaday readers will be on the same page as us on this one, but perhaps its time for a cycling manifesto to match our automotive one.\nThanks [cheetah_henry] for the tip.", "title": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u9589\u9396\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u5411\u304b\u3046", "body": "\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306f\u4fee\u7406\u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u4f9d\u5b58\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u9589\u9396\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u5411\u304b\u3046", "\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u672a\u6765", "\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u4fee\u7406\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5012\u7523\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u611b\u597d\u8005\u3078\u306e\u8b66\u544a\uff1a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u4f9d\u5b58\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u7406\u7531"]}

Most of us can recite a list of the main players in the market, but how many of us would have Epoch and their Super Cassette Vision on that list? [Nicole Express] is here with a look at this forgotten machine which tried so hard and yet missed the target when competing with the NES or Master System.\nBefore the arrival of the Sega and Nintendo cartridge based systems, one of the better known Japanese consoles was the Epoch Cassette Vision. This was something of a hybrid between single-game TV games and an Atari 2600 style computing device for games, in that it used pre-programmed microcontrollers in its cartridges rather than the ROMs of the 2600. For the late-70s gamer this was still hot stuff, but by 1983 as the Master System and NES hove into view it was definitely past its best. Epochs response for 1984 was the Super Cassette Vision, a much more conventional 8-bit console with on the face of it some respectable graphics and sound hardware.\nThe article looks at the consoles capabilities in detail, highlighting the multi-colored sprites and smooth sprite movement, but also the tilemap limitations and the somewhat awful sound chip shared with handheld games and sounding very much like it. Coupled with its inferior controllers and TV game style aesthetic, its not difficult to see why it would be the last console from this manufacturer.\nIf forgotten consoles are your thing, have a read about the Fairchild Channel F, the machine that gave us console cartridges.", "title": "\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u53f2: \u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u300c\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3001\u7279\u306b\u30a8\u30dd\u30c3\u30af\u793e\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u53f2: \u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u300c\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u30a8\u30dd\u30c3\u30af\u793e\u306e\u6311\u6226: NES\u3084\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790: \u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3068\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9650\u754c", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u9032\u5316: \u30a8\u30dd\u30c3\u30af\u793e\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3068\u5931\u6557", "\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b: \u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30ebF\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

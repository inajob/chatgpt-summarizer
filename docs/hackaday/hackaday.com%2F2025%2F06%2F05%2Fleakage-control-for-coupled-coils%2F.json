[Sam Ben-Yaakov] walks you through just that in his video Versatile Coupled Inductor Circuit Model and Examples of Its Use.\nThe core idea is as follows. Coupled inductors can be modeled in dozens of ways, but this one adds a twist: a tunable parameter \ud835\udc65 between k and 1 (where k is the coupling coefficient). This fourth degree of freedom doesnt change L\u2081, L\u2082 or mutual inductance M (they remain invariant) but it lets you shuffle leakage where you want it, giving practical flexibility in designing or simulating transformers, converters, or filters with asymmetric behavior.\nIf you need leakage on one side only, set \ud835\udc65=k. Prefer symmetrical split? Set \ud835\udc65=1. Its like parametric EQ, but magnetic. And: the maths holds up. As [Sam Ben-Yaakov] derives and confirms that for any \ud835\udc65 in the range, external characteristics remain identical.\nIts especially useful when testing edge cases, or explaining inductive quirks that dont behave quite like ideal transformers should. A good model to stash in your toolbox.\nAs weve seen previously, [Sam Ben-Yaakov] is at home when it comes to concepts that need tinkering, trial and error, and a dash of visuals to convey.\n"}

Most electric vehicles still deliver power via the same system used by internal combustion cars. Hyundai/Kia has now revealed a system they think will provide a new paradigm with their Universal Wheel Drive System (Uni Wheel). [via Electrek]\nWhat appears at first to be a hub motor is in fact a geared wheel that keeps the motor close without the problem of high unsprung weight. Power is fed into a sun gear which can move independently of the wheel allowing the system to maintain a more consistent driveline and avoid power variability over the range of suspension travel like youd find in a CV joint experiencing high deflection.\nWe have some concerns about the durability of such a system when compared with the KISS and long development history of CV joints, but we cant deny that moving the motors of an electric vehicle out to the corners would allow more packaging flexibility for the cargo and passenger areas. Were also excited to see open source replicas make their way into smaller robotics projects now that the images have been released. If youve already made one in CAD, send us a tip at tips@hackaday.com.\nLooking for more interesting innovations in electric cars? How about an off-grid camper van? If you think automakers are overcomplicating something that should be simple, read the Minimal Motoring Manifesto.\n\n", "title": "\u30d2\u30e5\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4/\u30ad\u30a2\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30e0\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08Uni Wheel\uff09\u300d\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "\u30d2\u30e5\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4/\u30ad\u30a2\u304c\u3001Uni Wheel\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u99c6\u52d5\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u30cf\u30d6\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u4e00\u5b9a\u306e\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u3092\u4fdd\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u306b\u306f\u7591\u554f\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u8377\u7269\u3084\u4e57\u5ba2\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d2\u30e5\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4/\u30ad\u30a2\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30e0\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08Uni Wheel\uff09\u300d\u3092\u767a\u8868", "\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u52d5\u529b\u4f1d\u9054\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u308b", "\u9ad8\u3044\u5fdc\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5909\u5f62\u3092\u9632\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5916\u90e8\u306b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u914d\u7f6e\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u99c6\u52d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u7dad\u6301\u306b\u6210\u529f", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u304c\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u306b\u671f\u5f85"]}

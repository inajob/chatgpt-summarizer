However, in the year 2025, a Z80-compatible machine with just 8 kB of RAM is hardly much to get excited about. [shiura] decided to take one of these old machines and upgrade it into something more modern and useful.\nThe build maintains the best parts of the Sharp design  namely, the case and the keypad. The original circuit board has been entirely ripped out, and a custom PCB was designed to interface with the membrane keypad and host the new internals. [shiura] landed on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to run the show. Its a capable machine that runs Linux rather well and has wireless connectivity out of the box. Its paired with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller that handles interfacing all the various parts of the original Sharp hardware. It also handles the connection to the 25664 OLED display. The new setup can run in ESP32-only mode, where it acts as a classic RPN-style calculator. Alternatively, the Pi Zero can be powered up for a full-fat computing experience.\nThe result of this work is a great little cyberdeck that looks straight out of the 1980s, but with far more capability. Weve seen a few of these old pocket computers pop up before, too.\n\n", "title": "- 1988\u5e74\u767b\u5834\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7PC-G801\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "1988\u5e74\u767b\u5834\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7PC-G801\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u300280\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u5916\u89b3\u3067\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- 1988\u5e74\u767b\u5834\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7PC-G801\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- Raspberry Pi Zero\u3067\u8607\u308b\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- ESP32-S3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u6b8b\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3082\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30afRPN\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6539\u9020\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8PC"]}

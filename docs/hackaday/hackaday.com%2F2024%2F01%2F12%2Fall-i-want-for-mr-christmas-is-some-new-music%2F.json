When [thecowgoesmoo] picked up a Mr. Christmas Symphonium music box one day, they knew they wanted to make it play more than just the standard Christmas and classical fare that ships with the thing.\nSo they did what any self-respecting hacker would do, and they wrote a MATLAB script that generates new disk silhouette images that they then cut from cardboard with a laser cutter. They also used various other materials like a disposable cutting mat. Really, whatever is lying around thats stiff enough and able to be cut should work. You know you want to hear Van Halens Jump coming from a tinkling music box, dont you? Be sure to check out the video demonstration after the break.\nIf you dont want to wait around until a Mr. Christmas lands in your lap, why not make your own hand-cranked music box and accompanying scores?\n\n"}

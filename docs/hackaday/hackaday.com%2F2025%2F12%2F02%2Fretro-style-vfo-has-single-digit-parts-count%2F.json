That the kind of project [mircemk]s Simple Retro Style VFO is  its a variable frequency oscillator for HAM and other use, built with just a couple of modules.\nStrictly speaking, this is all you need for the project.\nThe modules in question are the SI5351 Clock Generator module, which is a handy bit of kit with its own crystal reference and PLL to generate frequencies up to 150 MHz, and the Elecrow CrowPanel 1.28inch-HMI ESP32 Rotary Display. The ESP32 in the CrowPanel controls the SI5351 module via I2C; control is via the rest of the CrowPanel module. This Rotary Display is a circular touchscreen surrounded by a rotary display, so [mircmk] has all the inputs he needs to control the VFO.\nTo round out the parts count, he adds an appropriate connector, plus a power switch, red LED and a lithium battery. One could include a battery charger module as well, but [mircmk] didnt have one on hand. Even if he had, that still keeps the parts count well inside the single digits. If you like video, weve embedded his about the project below; if not the write up on Hackaday.io is upto [mircmk]s typical standard.\u00a0\nPeople have been using the SI5351 to make VFOs for years now, but the addition of the round display makes for a delightfully retro presentation.\nThanks to [mircmk] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u5909\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u767a\u632f\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u98a8VFO\u304c\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u88fd\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u5909\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u767a\u632f\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "- SI5351\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fVFO\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- ESP32\u3068\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u90e8\u54c1\u70b9\u6570\u308f\u305a\u304b\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30e0\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528VFO", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u767a\u632f\u5668\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

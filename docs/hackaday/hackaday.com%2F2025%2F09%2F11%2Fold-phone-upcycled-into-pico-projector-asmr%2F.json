Upcycling has always been in the hackers toolkit, and cellphones provide a wealth of resources for those bold enough to seize them. [Huy Vector] was bold enough, and transformed an old smartphone into a portable pico projector and an ASMR-style video. Thats what we call efficiency!\nKidding aside, the speech-free video embedded below absolutely gives enough info to copy along with [Huy Vector] even though he doesnt say a word the whole time. Youll need deft hands and a phone you really dont care about, because one of the early steps is pulling the LCD apart to remove the back layers to shine an LED through. Youll absolutely need an old phone for that, since that trick doesnt apply to the OLED displays that most flagships have been rocking the past few years.\n\nIt looks like hes specifying a 20 W LED (the bill of materials is in the description of the video on YouTube), so this projector wont be super bright, but it will certainly be usable in darkened rooms. At least that lower wattage also means the batteries salvaged from an old power bank should give enough runtime to finish a movie as long as its not the directors cut, anyway. A heatsink and fan keep the LED from cooking itself and whats left of the cell phone inside the foam board case.\nThe projected image looks surprisingly good considering the only optics in this thing are the LCD and the lens from a 5x magnifying glass from AliExpress. The foam board case, too, ends up looking surprisingly good once the textured vinyl wrap is applied. Thats a quick and easy way to get a nice looking prototype, if you dont particularly need durability.\nIts not the brightest screen you can build, nor the highest resolution projector weve seen but it might just be the easiest such build weve featured. As long as you handle the tricky LCD disassembly step, this is absolutely something we could see doing with children, which isnt always the case on Hackaday.\n<!--more-->\n"}

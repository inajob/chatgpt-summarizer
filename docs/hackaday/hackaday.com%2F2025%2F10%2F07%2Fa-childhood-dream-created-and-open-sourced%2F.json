[Brady Y. Lin] was one of the latter, and now, with the skills hes learning at Northwestern, he can make that dream a reality  and share it with all of us as an open source hardware project.\nThe dream instruments name is Stradex1, and its a lovely bit of kit. The fretless neck is a SoftPot linear potentiometer being sampled by an ADS1115 ADC  thats a 16-bit unit, so while one might pedantically argue that there are discreet frets, theres 2^15 of them, which is functionally the same as none at all. Certainly its enough resolution for continuous-sounding pitch control, as well as vibrato, as you can see at 3:20 in the demo video below. The four buttons that correspond to the four strings of a violin arent just push-buttons, but also contain force sensors (again, sampled by the 16-bit ADC) to allow for fine volume control of each tone.\nA few other potentiometers flesh out the build, allowing control over different MIDI parameters, such as what key [Brady] is playing on. The body is a combination of 3D printed plastic and laser-cut acrylic, but [Brady] suggests you could also print the front and back panels if you dont happen to have a laser cutter handy.\nThis project sounds great, and it satisfies the makers inner child, so whats not to love. Weve had lots of MIDI controllers on Hackaday over the years  everything from stringless guitars \u00a0to wheel-less Hurdy-Gurdies to say nothing of laser harps galore  but somehow, weve never had a MIDI violin. The violin hacks we have featured tend to be either 3D printed or comically small.\nIf you like this project but dont feel like fabbing and populating the PCB, [Brady] is going to be giving one away to his 1000th YouTube subscriber. As of this writing, hes only got 800, so that could be you!\n\n"}

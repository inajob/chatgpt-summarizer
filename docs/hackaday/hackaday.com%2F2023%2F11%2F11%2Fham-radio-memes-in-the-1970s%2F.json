The idea is you take a picture, send some squeaks and blips over the air, and in about 8 or 10 seconds, a single frame of video shows up at the receiver. Hams arent the only ones who used it. The Apollo missions used an SSTV system in some cases, too.\nIve been a ham radio operator for a very long time. When I first heard about SSTV, I thought it sounded cool that you could be talking to someone and then show them a picture of your station or your dog or your kids. But when I looked into it, the reality was far different. In the pre-internet days, SSTV-equipped hams hung out on a handful of watering hole frequencies and basically just sent memes and selfies to each other. Everyone would take turns, but there wasnt really any conversation.\nThis actually still goes on, but the hardware isnt a big deal anymore. The Robot in the video had to decode the signal from audio and store the image somehow. On old gear  some of it homebrew  it was simply persistent phosphor that would eventually fade, but, of course, eventually, images were stored in some form of digital memory. These days, you are likely to use a PC soundcard to both send and receive the necessary audio.\n\nBut in the mid-1970s, the Robot, with its 6-inch screen and $295 price tag, was a marvel. It would rapidly become obsolete, though, as SSTV practitioners moved to more advanced formats that used color and had better performance.\nHonestly, we were surprised the old machine worked as well as it did, handily decoding some prerecorded SSTV signals. Overall, its great to see this classic piece of gear again. The International Space Station sometimes sends SSTV. Of course, if you ever needed to send a picture over a noisy medium, you might want to borrow the ham radio technique.\n", "title": "\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u5c4b\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5fa9\u5143 (\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u4ed8\u304d)", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30e0\u30ae\u30a2\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u304cSSTV\uff08\u9045\u3044\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff09\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u6614\u306f\u5199\u771f\u3092\u9001\u308a\u5408\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u306e\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u5c4b\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5fa9\u5143 (\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u4ed8\u304d)", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308bSSTV\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5199\u771f\u3092\u9001\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "SSTV\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30cf\u30e0\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9593\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3055\u308c\u308b\u753b\u50cf\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5", "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8SSTV\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5091\u4f5c\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u591a\u3044\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u4e0a\u3067\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u9001\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u6280\u8853\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f"]}

[John Sutley] decided to complete his Halloween party with a drink dispenser looking as though it was dumped by a backstreet laboratory. Its not only an impressive looking separating funnel, it even runs on an Arduino. The setup combines lab glassware, servo motors, and an industrial control panel straight from a process plant.\nThe power management appeared the most challenging part. The three servos drew more current than one Arduino could handle. [John] overcame voltage sag, brownouts, and ghostly resets. A healthy 1000 \u00b5F capacitor across the 5-volt rail fixed it. With a bit of PWM control and some C++, [John] managed to finish up his interactive bar system where guests could seal their own doom by pressing simple buttons.\nThis combines the thrill of Halloween with the ghost in the machine. Going past the question whether you should ever drink from a test tube  what color would you pick? Lingonberry juice or aqua regia, who could tell? From this video, we wouldnt trust the bartender on it  but build it yourself and see what it brings you!\n\n"}

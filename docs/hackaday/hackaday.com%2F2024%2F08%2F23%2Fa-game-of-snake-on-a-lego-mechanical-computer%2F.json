But then he took it to another place entirely and built a completely mechanical, nearly 100% LEGO version of Snake. And its just as cool as it sounds.\nMind you, its a little hard to grok how this whole contraption works, which has been in the works for a while, but well try to summarize as best we can. The most important aspect of this build is that there are no electronics at all  everything is done with mechanical linkages, with some Technics pneumatic components and a couple of electric motors to provide the oomph. The three main components are the input section, which consists of a two-axis joystick, a tail buffer, which keeps track of the length of the snakes tail as gameplay progresses, and the largest component, the 1616 display.\nThe joystick translates user inputs into pneumatic signals which pass through a mechanical filtering unit that prevents the head of the snake from doubling back on itself. The filtered inputs then pass into the screen reader, a complex device that probes the status of a given pixel on the display and determines the status of the snakes head. If it touches a snake pixel, the games over. Hitting a blank pixel moves the head of the snake by one and takes one pixel off the end, while a food pixel extends the snakes length.\nKeeping track of the length of the snake is the job of the buffer, which uses Technics tank tracks and levers. Setting a one is done by flipping the lever to one side as it passes under the write head; a read head further down the track senses which way the lever is flipped and translates it into a pneumatic signal. The buffer has four channels, one for each possible direction the snakes head could be moving. The signals drive a screen writer, which moves a pyramidal follower across a series of push-rods that flip the corresponding pixel on the display to show the proper icon. Simplicity itself? No, but the video below will make things a lot clearer.\nIt doesnt look like [Ozzie] is quite done with this game, as he doesnt show any actual gameplay yet. Wed love to see and hear that  we suspect itll make quite a racket. Well be keeping an eye out for this one, but while we wait, check out this rope braiding machine or watch Lego break steel.\n\n\nThanks to [Hari Wiguna] for spotting this one for us.", "title": "\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b", "body": "LEGO\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5168\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u306eSnake\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u4e00\u5207\u306a\u304f\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5165\u529b\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3001\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30011616\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3002\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u304c\u4f55\u3089\u304b\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u305f\u3089\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3002Snake\u306e\u9577\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306f\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u88fd\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b", "\u30ec\u30b4\u3060\u3051\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u975e\u96fb\u5b50\u7684\u306a\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30b4\u88fd\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3055", "\u30ec\u30b4\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f"]}

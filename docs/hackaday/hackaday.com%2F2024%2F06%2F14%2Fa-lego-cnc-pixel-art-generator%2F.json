Having seen that on our travels we were especially interested to watch [Creative Mindstorms] video doing something very similar using an entirely LEGO-built machine but taking the images from an AI image generator.\nThe basic operation of the machine is akin to that of a pick-and-place machine, and despite the relatively large size of a small LEGO square it still has to place at a surprisingly high resolution. This it achieves through the use of a LEGO lead screw for the Y axis and a rack and pinon for the X axis, each driven by a single motor.\nThe Z axis in this machine simply has to pick up and release a piece, something solved with a little ingenuity, while the magazine of pixels was adapted with lower friction from another makers design. The software is all written in Python, and takes input from end stop switches to position the machine.\nWe like this build, and we can appreciate the quantity of work that must have gone into it. If youre a LEGO fan and can manage the trip to Bilund, theres plenty of other LEGO goodness to see there.\n\n", "title": "LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30f3\u30c9\u306b\u3042\u308bLEGO\u672c\u793e\u3067\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9854\u5199\u771f\u3092LEGO\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u308b\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306fAI\u753b\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3067\u540c\u69d8\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001LEGO\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4f5c\u52d5\u306fX\u30fbY\u8ef8\u3092\u99c6\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u5438\u7740\u30fb\u653e\u51fa\u3059\u308bZ\u8ef8\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001Python\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3002", "titles": ["LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "LEGO\u88fd\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u3067AI\u753b\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c", "LEGO\u306e\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u4f5c\u308a", "Python\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u308bLEGO\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "Bilund\u306eLEGO\u672c\u793e\u3067\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308bLEGO\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f"]}

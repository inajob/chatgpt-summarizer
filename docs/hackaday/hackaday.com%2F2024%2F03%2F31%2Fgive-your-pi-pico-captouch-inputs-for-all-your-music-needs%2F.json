This doesnt mean you cant do it  the usual software-driven way works wonderfully, and only requires an external pullup resistor! In case you wanted a demonstration or you have a capacitive touch project in mind, this lighthearted video by [Jeremy Cook] is a must watch, and hes got a healthy amount of resources for you in store, too!\nIn this video, [Jeremy] presents you with a KiCad schematic and an PCB design you can use to quickly add whole 23 capacitive touch sensing inputs to a Pi Pico! The board is flexible mechanically, easy to assemble as [Jeremy] demonstrates, and all the pins involved can still be used as regular GPIOs if youd like. Plus, its fully open-source, can easily be assembled on your own, and available on Tindie too!\nOf course, such a board doesnt get created for no reason  [Jeremy] has a healthy amount of musical creations and nifty ideas to show off. We quite liked the trick of using old PCBs as capacitive touch sensing, using copper fills as electrodes  which has helped create an amusing macropad of macropads, and, theres quite a bit more to see.\nIf capacitive touch projects ever struck a chord with you and you enjoy music-related hacking, [Jeremy]s got a whole YouTube channel you ought to check out. Oh, and if one of the musical projects in the video caught your eye, it might just be the one weve featured previously!\n", "title": "RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f23\u500b\u306e\u9759\u96fb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u529b\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "RP2040\u306f\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u5bb9\u91cf\u6027\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30da\u30ea\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30eb\u3092\u6301\u305f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u99c6\u52d5\u3067\u5916\u90e8\u30d7\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u62b5\u6297\u306e\u307f\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u3002[Jeremy Cook]\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u306fKiCad\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3001Pi Pico\u306b23\u306e\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f23\u500b\u306e\u9759\u96fb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u529b\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9759\u96fb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u529b\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u53e4\u3044PCB\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9759\u96fb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af", "\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u9759\u96fb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u5165\u529b\u4ed8\u304d\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u97f3\u697d\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306eYouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb"]}

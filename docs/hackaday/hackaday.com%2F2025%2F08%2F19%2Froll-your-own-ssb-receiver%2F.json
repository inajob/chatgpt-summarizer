He created an SSB receiver and, lucky for us, he documented it all in a video you can see below. He walks through how to generate SSB, too. If videos arent your thing, you can go back to the blog post from [Gary Schafer] that inspired him to make the video, which is also a wealth of information.\nThere is a little math  you almost cant avoid it when talking about this topic. But [Paul] does a good job of explaining it all as painlessly as possible. The intuitive part is simple: An AM signal has most of its power in the carrier and half of whats left in a redundant sideband. So if you can strip all those parts out and amplify just one sideband, you get better performance.\n\nWe love to play with GNU Radio. Sure, the GNU Radio Companion is just a fancy shell over some Python code, but we like how it maps software to blocks like you might use to design a traditional receiver.\nIf you want to try any of this out and dont have a sufficient HF antenna or even an HF-capable SDR, no worries. [Paul] thoughtfully recorded some IQ samples off the air into a file. You can play back through your design to test how it works.\nIf you have never used GNU Radio, starting with audio isnt a bad way to get your feet wet. Thats how we started our tutorial a decade ago. Still worth working through it if you are trying to get started.\n"}

There they have found the imperfections requiring technical skill to cope with that they desire, but theyve also come face-to-face with the very high cost and sometimes sketchy availability of film stocks. From this has come the so-called post-digital movement which marries analog cameras and lenses with digital sensors, and of this a particularly nice example comes from [Michael Suguitan]. Hes taken a classic Leica M2 rangefinder camera, and built a new back for it containing a Raspberry Pi Zero and sensor.\nPerhaps the best thing about this conversion, and something which should propagate forward into other builds, is the way it does not hack or modify the original camera beyond the replacement of the already-removable back. A vintage Leica is a pricey item, so it would be a foolhardy hacker who would proceed to gut it for a digital conversion. Instead hes mounted everything that makes a digital camera, the sensor, Pi Zero, and screen board, behind the camera body. The Pi shutter trigger comes from the Leicas flash terminal, meaning that theres plenty of time for it to take a photo while the shutter is open.\nHes admirably preserved the usage and properties of the Leica, and his photographs as can be seen in the video below the break bear testament to what is possible with the camera. He still has to work with the tiny sensor size though, meaning that all photographs are at a much higher zoom level than on the original. We would love to see a camera conversion like this one that incorporates appropriate lenses to bring the picture to focus on this small sensor.\nWe wont own a Leica any time soon, but we like this conversion. Its by far the most sympathetic, but its not the first rangefinder conversion weve seen.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u305d\u308d\u3048\u3066\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff01", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u3001\u4f55\u304b\u304c\u6b20\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u611f\u3058\u308b\u5199\u771f\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u304c\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3068\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3057\u305f\u4f8b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u73fe\u50cf\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308b\u8cbb\u7528\u3084\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u5165\u624b\u96e3\u3082\u89e3\u6c7a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u3001\u65e2\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u307f\u3092\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3060\u3068\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u305d\u308d\u3048\u3066\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff01", "Leica M2\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u6539\u9020\u305b\u305a\u306b\u5b8c\u74a7\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u307f\u305f\uff01", "\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306bRaspberry Pi Zero\u3068\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3001\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u58ca\u3057\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3078\uff01", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u878d\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30dd\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e0\u30fc\u30d6\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8"]}

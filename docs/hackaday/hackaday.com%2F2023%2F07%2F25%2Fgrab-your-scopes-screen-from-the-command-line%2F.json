[Andrej Radovi\u0107] has a Tektronix TDS2022 which can print its screen to any of its various interfaces, and he set about automating the process of acquisition with a Bash script.\nThe easiest interface to use was the trusty serial port  hardly the fastest but definitely the best supported. But how does one retrieve an image fired down a serial port? Most of the post is devoted to spotting file headers in a Bash script monitoring the serial port, and streaming the result to a local file. Theres a discussion of the various formats supported by the Tek, with an ancient PCX bitmap format being chosen over Postscript for speed. The result is a decent quality screen grab, making the scope that little bit more useful and perhaps extending its life.\nPerhaps your instrument isnt a TEK, but the chances are you can still make it bend to your will from a PC. Try it, with the magic of VISA."}

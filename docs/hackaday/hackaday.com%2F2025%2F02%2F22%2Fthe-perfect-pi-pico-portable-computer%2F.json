He has a DevTerm, but it didnt quite fit his needs. This is Hackaday after all, so he loaded up his favorite CAD software and started designing. The obvious choice here would be a Raspberry Pi. But [Abe] didnt want to drop in a Linux computer  he was going for something a bit smaller.\nAn RP2040 Pico would be a perfect fit. Driving a display with the Pico can be eat a lot of resources though. The solution was a PicoVision from Pimoroni. PicoVision uses two RP2040 chips. One drives an HDMI port, while the other is free to run application software. This meant a standard HDMI screen could be used.\nThe keyboard was a bit harder. After a lot of searching, [Abe] found an IR remote designed for smart TVs. The QWERTY keyboard was the perfect size but didnt have an interface he could use. He fixed that with an adapter PCB including an I2C GPIO expander chip. A bit of I2C driver software later, and he had a working input keyboard.\nHardware doesnt do anything without software though. The software running on the handheld is called Slime OS, and the source is available at [Abes] GitHub. Its a launcher, with support for applications written in python. [Abe] has a few basic demos working, but hes looking for help to get more features up and running.\nAlthough it wasnt quite what [Abe] was after, our own [Donald Papp] came away fairly impressed when he gave the DevTerm a test drive back in 2022. Something to consider if youre looking for a Linux handheld and not quite ready to build one yourself.\n\n", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "body": "[Abe]\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002RP2040 Pico\u3068PicoVision\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3001Slime OS\u3092\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578b\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- RP2040 Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- PicoVision\u3067HDMI\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- IR\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u6539\u9020\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- Slime OS\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u958b\u767a\u6982\u8981"]}

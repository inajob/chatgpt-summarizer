Theyve devised a mostly-paper RFID tag thats as safe to recycle as a piece of paper with a pencil doodle on it.\nThe teams startup, PulpaTronics have created a design that uses paper as its only material. The circuitry is marked on the paper with a laser set to low power, which doesnt burn or cut the paper, but instead changes to composition to be conductive.\nPulpaTronics were also able to create a chip-less RFID tag much the same way, using a pattern of concentric circles to convey information. The company estimates that these tags will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70%, when compared with traditional RFID tags. Theyll also cost about half as much.\nRFID is used in many industries, but its also great for hacking. Heres an 8-track player that harnesses the power of RFID tags to play songs off of an SD card.\nThanks for the tip, [gir.st]!", "title": "RFID\u30bf\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3001\u7d19\u3060\u3051\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u63d0\u6848", "body": "\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u306eRoyal College of Art\u306e\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3001\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u7d19\u3067\u3067\u304d\u305f\u518d\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306aRFID\u30bf\u30b0\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u6392\u51fa\u91cf\u309270\uff05\u524a\u6e1b\u3067\u304d\u3001\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3082\u534a\u5206\u306b\u306a\u308b\u898b\u7a4d\u3082\u308a\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["RFID\u30bf\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3001\u7d19\u3060\u3051\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u63d0\u6848", "\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eRFID\u30bf\u30b0\u304c\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044", "\u30d7\u30eb\u30d1\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u304c\u7d19\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fRFID\u30bf\u30b0\u3092\u958b\u767a", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044RFID\u30bf\u30b0\u3067CO2\u6392\u51fa\u91cf\u309270%\u524a\u6e1b", "\u6574\u6570\u578b\u306e\u5186\u5f62\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u4f1d\u9054\u3059\u308bRFID\u30bf\u30b0"]}

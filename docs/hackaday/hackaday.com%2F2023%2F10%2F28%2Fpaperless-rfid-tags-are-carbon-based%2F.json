Theyve devised a mostly-paper RFID tag thats as safe to recycle as a piece of paper with a pencil doodle on it.\nThe teams startup, PulpaTronics have created a design that uses paper as its only material. The circuitry is marked on the paper with a laser set to low power, which doesnt burn or cut the paper, but instead changes to composition to be conductive.\nPulpaTronics were also able to create a chip-less RFID tag much the same way, using a pattern of concentric circles to convey information. The company estimates that these tags will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70%, when compared with traditional RFID tags. Theyll also cost about half as much.\nRFID is used in many industries, but its also great for hacking. Heres an 8-track player that harnesses the power of RFID tags to play songs off of an SD card.\nThanks for the tip, [gir.st]!"}

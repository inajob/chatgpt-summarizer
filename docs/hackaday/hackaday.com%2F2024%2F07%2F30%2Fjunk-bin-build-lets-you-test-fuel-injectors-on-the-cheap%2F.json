That doesnt mean youre out of luck, though, especially if youve got scrap galore and a DIY spirit, as this junk bin fuel injector test stand ably demonstrates.\n[Desert Rat Racer]s test rig is designed to support four injectors at once and to test them under conditions as close as possible to what theyll experience when installed. To that end, [Rat] mounted a junk intake manifold to a stand made from scrap wood and metal found by the side of the road. A pickle jar serves as a reservoir for the test fluid  he wisely used mineral spirits as a safer substitute for gasoline  and a scrap electric fuel pump pressurizes a junk fuel rail, which distributes fuel to the injectors under test.\nFor testing, the injectors are wired up to an electric injector tester, which is one of the few off-the-shelf components in the build. The fuel pump and injectors are powered by the 12 volt rail of a scrapped PC power supply. Just being able to watch the spray pattern is often enough to find a faulty injector, but in case a more quantitative test is indicated, each injector is positioned over a cheap glass cylinder to catch the test fluid, and scraps of a tape measure are used to measure the depth of the collected fluid. No fancy  and expensive  graduated cylinders required.\nWhile we truly respect the hackiness of [Desert Rat Racer]s build, the concept of avoiding buying tactical tools is foreign to us. We understand the logic of not dropping a ton on a single-use tool, but wheres the fancy blow-molded plastic case?\n\n", "title": "DIY\u71c3\u6599\u5674\u5c04\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c", "body": "\u8eca\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u306f\u5c02\u9580\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u304c\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3002\u5ec3\u6750\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u71c3\u6599\u5674\u5c04\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u304c\u305d\u306e\u624b\u52a9\u3051\u30024\u3064\u306e\u5674\u5c04\u5668\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u8a66\u9a13\u7528\u6db2\u4f53\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5674\u5c04\u5668\u306f\u96fb\u52d5\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001\u5ec3PC\u96fb\u6e90\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u3002\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u4e0d\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u71c3\u6599\u5674\u5c04\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528", "\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u7528\u54c1DIY\u306e\u918d\u9190\u5473", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u71c3\u6599\u5674\u5c04\u5668\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30b0", "\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u8eca\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

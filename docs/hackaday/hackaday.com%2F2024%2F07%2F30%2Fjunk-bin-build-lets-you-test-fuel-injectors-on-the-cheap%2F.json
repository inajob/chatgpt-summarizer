That doesnt mean youre out of luck, though, especially if youve got scrap galore and a DIY spirit, as this junk bin fuel injector test stand ably demonstrates.\n[Desert Rat Racer]s test rig is designed to support four injectors at once and to test them under conditions as close as possible to what theyll experience when installed. To that end, [Rat] mounted a junk intake manifold to a stand made from scrap wood and metal found by the side of the road. A pickle jar serves as a reservoir for the test fluid  he wisely used mineral spirits as a safer substitute for gasoline  and a scrap electric fuel pump pressurizes a junk fuel rail, which distributes fuel to the injectors under test.\nFor testing, the injectors are wired up to an electric injector tester, which is one of the few off-the-shelf components in the build. The fuel pump and injectors are powered by the 12 volt rail of a scrapped PC power supply. Just being able to watch the spray pattern is often enough to find a faulty injector, but in case a more quantitative test is indicated, each injector is positioned over a cheap glass cylinder to catch the test fluid, and scraps of a tape measure are used to measure the depth of the collected fluid. No fancy  and expensive  graduated cylinders required.\nWhile we truly respect the hackiness of [Desert Rat Racer]s build, the concept of avoiding buying tactical tools is foreign to us. We understand the logic of not dropping a ton on a single-use tool, but wheres the fancy blow-molded plastic case?\n\n"}

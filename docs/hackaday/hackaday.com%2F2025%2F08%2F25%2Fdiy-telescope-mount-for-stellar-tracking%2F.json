As anyone whos spent time with a telescope can tell you, its not that simple, given that the Earth is always spinning. [Sven] set out to make his own mount to compensate for the rotation of the Earth, which led to some pretty amazing results.\nIn this project, [Sven] designed a GoTo mount, which is a telescope equatorial mount capable of being pointed at specific parts of the sky and tracking them to allow for long-exposure photos with minimal blur due to the Earths movement. He first went down the path of finding the correct harmonic gearbox for the steppers used. A harmonic drive system would allow smooth, precise movement without backlash, and the 100:1 stepdown would provide for the slightest of adjustments.\nThe steppers are controlled by a custom PCB [Sven] designed around an ESP32-S3. The first PCB had a mistake in the power delivery circuit. After a small tweak, V2 boards arrived and work great. The PCB runs OnStepX, a great open-source project centered around pointing telescopes, cutting down a lot of the software workload on this project.\nAfter all the work put in, you may be wondering how well it works. [Sven] was able to get a pointing accuracy of 1-2 arcseconds from his mount. To get an idea of how great that is, 1 arcsecond is about the same as pointing at a penny from 4 km (2.5 miles) away. Fantastic results, [Sven], and thank you for sending in this great project\u2014be sure to head over to his site and read all the details of this impressive build.

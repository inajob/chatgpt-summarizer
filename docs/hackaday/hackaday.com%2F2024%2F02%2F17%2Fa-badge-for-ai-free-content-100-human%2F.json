A lot of it is crap. Some of its confusing. But most of all, creators hate it when their hand-crafted works are compared with these digital extrusions from mathematical slop. Enter the not by AI badge.\nScreenshot from https://notbyai.fyi/business\nBasically, its exactly what it sounds like. A sleek, modern badge that you slap on your artwork to tell people that you did this, not an AI. There are pre-baked versions for writers (written by human), visual artists (painted by human), and musicians (produced by human). The idea is that these badges would help people identify human-generated content and steer away from AI content if theyre trying to avoid it.\nIts not just intended to be added to individual artworks. Websites that have at least 90% of content created by humans are invited to host the badge, along with apps, too. This directive reveals an immediate flaw\u2014the badge would easily confuse someone if they read the 10% of content by AI on a site wearing the badge. Theres also nothing stopping people from slapping the badge on AI-generated content and simply lying to people.\nYou might take a more cynical view if you dig deeper, though. The company is charging for various things, such as a monthly fee for businesses that want to display the badges.\nWeve talked about this before when we asked a simple question\u2014how do you convince people your artwork was made by a human? Were not sure weve yet found the answer, but this badge program is at least trying to do something about the issue. Share your human thoughts in the comments below."}

Thats the thinking behind [Bertrand Selva]s clever LoRaTube project.\nPVC pipe houses a self-contained LoRa repeater, complete with a big stack of D-size alkaline cells.\nLoRa is a fantastic solution for long-range and low-power wireless communication (and popular, judging by the number of projects built around it) and LoRaTube provides an autonomous repeater, contained entirely in a length of PVC pipe. Out the top comes the antenna and inside is all the necessary hardware, along with a stack of good old D-sized alkaline cells feeding a supercap-buffered power supply of his own design. Its weatherproof, inexpensive, self-contained, and thanks to extremely low standby current should last a good five years by [Bertrand]s reckoning.\nOne can make a quick LoRa repeater in about an hour but while the core hardware can be inexpensive, supporting electronics and components (not to mention enclosure) for off-grid deployment can quickly add significant cost. Solar panels, charge controllers, and a rechargeable power supply also add potential points of failure. Sometimes it makes more sense to go cheap, simple, and rugged. Eighteen D-sized alkaline cells stacked in a PVC tube is as rugged as it is affordable, especially if one gets several years worth of operation out of it.\nYou can watch [Bertrand] raise a LoRaTube repeater and do a range test in the video (French), embedded below.

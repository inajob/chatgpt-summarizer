Also, if you havent been keeping abreast of developments, KiCad is now at version 9, as of February this year.\n\n", "title": "- KiCad\u3067\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc", "body": "Pat Deegan\u304cKiCad\u306e\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- KiCad\u3067\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc", "- Pat Deegan\u304c\u6559\u3048\u308b\uff01KiCad\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u30ef\u30f3\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bKiCad\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "- KiCad\u306e\u91cd\u5927\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\uff1a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f39\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306aKiCad\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u96c6\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

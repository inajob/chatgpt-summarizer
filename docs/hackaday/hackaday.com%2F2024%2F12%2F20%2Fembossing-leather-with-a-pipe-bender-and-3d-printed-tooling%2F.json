However, the tooling for making these fashionable items is not always easy to come by, and it rarely comes cheap. What do we do when a tool is expensive and obscure? We 3D print our own, as [Myth Impressions] demonstrates.\nThe build is based around a Harbor Freight pipe bender. However, instead of the usual metal tooling, its been refitted with a printed embossing ring specifically designed for imprinting leather. The tool features raised ridges in an attractive pattern, and the pipe bender merely serves as a straightforward device for rolling the plastic tooling over a leather belt blank. Once cranked through the machine, the leather belt comes out embossed with a beautiful design.\nIts a neat project, and the 3D printed tooling works surprisingly well. The key is that leather is relatively soft, so its possible to use plastic tools quite effectively. With that said, you can even form steel with printed tooling if you use the right techniques.\nWeve seen some other neat leatherworking hacks before, like this nicely-modified Singer sewing machine.\n\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9769\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3092\u30a8\u30f3\u30dc\u30b9\u52a0\u5de5\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u5de5\u5177\u3067\u9769\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3092\u578b\u62bc\u3057\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u5de5\u5177\u304c\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9769\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3092\u30a8\u30f3\u30dc\u30b9\u52a0\u5de5\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u5de5\u5177\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30dc\u30b9\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u7d30\u5de5", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u9769\u7d30\u5de5\u5411\u3051\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u3068\u306f"]}

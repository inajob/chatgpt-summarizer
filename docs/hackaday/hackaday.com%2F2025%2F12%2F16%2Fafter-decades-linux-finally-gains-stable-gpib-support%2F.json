It first saw use on HP laboratory equipment in the 1970s, but was soon after also used by microcomputers like the Commodore PET, Commodore 64 and others. Although not high-speed with just 8 MB/s, nor with galvanic isolation requirements, its an uncomplicated bus design that can be implemented without much of a blip on the BOM costs.\nThe IEEE 488 standard consists of multiple elements, with 488.1 defining the physical interface and 488.2 the electrical protocol. Over the decades a communication protocol was also developed, in the form of SCPI and its standardized way of communicating with a wide range of devices using a simple human-readable protocol.\nAlthough the physical side of IEEE 488 has changed over the years, with Ethernet becoming a major alternative to the short GPIB cables and large connectors, the electrical protocol and SCPI alike are still very much relevant today. This latest addition to the Linux kernel should make it much easier to use both old and new equipment equipped with this bus.", "title": "- Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bGPIB\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7d71\u5408", "body": "Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb6.19\u306bGPIB\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- Linux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bGPIB\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7d71\u5408", "- GPIB: 1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u7d9a\u304f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u30d0\u30b9", "- IEEE 488\u898f\u683c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8003\u5bdf", "- SCPI\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9069\u7528", "- Linux\u3067\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050GPIB\u306e\u5229\u4fbf\u6027"]}

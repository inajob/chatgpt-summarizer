But as much as we fear punching an expensive hole in a chip with an errant spark, electrostatic discharge damage isnt the only kind of static hazard your digital designs can face.\nTo be fair, the static hazard demonstrated by [Shane Oberloier] in the video below isnt really an electrostatic problem. Static in this case refers to when a change to an input of a logic circuit gives an unexpected output until the circuit stabilizes. The circuit shown is pretty simple, with three inputs going into a combination of AND and NOT gates before going into an OR gate. The static hazard manifests as a glitch in the output when the middle input lines logical state is toggled; according to the circuits truth table, the output shouldnt change under these conditions, but the oscilloscope clearly captures a high-low-high blip. [Dr. Shane]s explanation of why this happens makes perfect sense: the inverter on that input line has a brief but non-zero propagation time, putting the whole circuit in an ambiguous state before finally settling down to the correct output value.\nSo how do you fix something like this? This gets into the Boolean weeds a bit, and we wont pretend to fully understand it, but at least for this case, [Dr. Shane] was able to add a single AND gate to sum the two other inputs and pipe the output into another input of the OR gate. That has the effect of canceling out the race condition caused by the inverter, but at the expense of a more complicated circuit, of course.\nWe found this to be a fascinating and informative discussion of a potential pitfall in logic design. But, if you still want to see some MOSFETs executed with static electricity, who are we to object?\n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u3067\u306e\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u5371\u967a\u306f\u3088\u304f\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u3082\u9759\u7684\u306a\u5371\u967a\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5165\u529b\u306e\u5909\u5316\u304c\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5b89\u5b9a\u524d\u306b\u51fa\u529b\u7d50\u679c\u306b\u4e00\u6642\u7684\u306a\u5909\u5316\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u8ffd\u52a0\u306eAND\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u56de\u8def\u306f\u3088\u308a\u8907\u96d1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3068\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30e2\u30b9\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002"]}

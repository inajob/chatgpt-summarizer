Alternatively, you could follow [TRDB]s example, and design your own from scratch.\nThe Lizard, as it is known, is a fun little RC car. Its got a vaguely Formula 1-inspired aesthetic, and looks fetching with the aid of two-tone 3D printed parts. Its designed for speed and handling, with a rear-wheel-drive layout and sprung suspension at all four corners to soak up the bumps. The majority of the vehicle is 3D printed in PETG, including the body and the gearbox and differential. However, some suspension components are made in TPU for greater flexibility and resistance to impact. [TRDB] specified commercial off-the-shelf wheels to provide good grip that couldnt easily be achieved with 3D-printed tires. An ESP32 is responsible for receiving commands from [TRDBs] custom RC controller running the same microcontroller. It sends commands to the speed controller that runs the Lizards brushed DC motor from a 3S lithium-polymer battery.\nThe final product looks sleek and handles well. It also achieved a GPS-verified top speed of 48 km/h as per [TRDBs] testing. Weve seen some other great DIY RC cars over the years, too, like this example that focuses on performance fundamentals. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cRC\u30ab\u30fc\u300c\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eRC\u30ab\u30fc\u300cLizard\u300d\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u8d70\u884c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cRC\u30ab\u30fc\u300c\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdRC\u30ab\u30fc", "- \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0RC\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 48 km/h\u9054\u6210\uff01DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u901f\u3044RC\u30ab\u30fc"]}

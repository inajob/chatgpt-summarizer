The trouble is, in the many decades during which your purchase went from being pride and joy to forgotten in a drawer to lying on the shelf of a thrift store, its performance may have degraded a little. Does the shutter still operate as it should? How long is a split second anyway? You need a shutter speed tester, and luckily for us, [Stuart Brown] has one.\nThere are no sharks involved in this build, but it does rely on laser diodes as a light source. There are three of them as well as three sensors, packaged photodiodes with a Schmidt trigger. These feed an Arduino which is hooked up to a TFT display, and the software measures how long each diode receives the light. Were told it can also measure the raise time on curtain shutters, another important metric.\nTheres little in the way of usage examples, but were guessing it requires positioning the camera between lasers and photodiodes. Were curious as to how such an instrument would perform on a camera with a fixed lens, or whether its only suitable for those with access to the shutter itself. If this subject interests you, its not the first shutter speed tester weve shown you.\nHeader image: Runner1616, CC BY-SA 4.0.", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4fee\u7406\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a08\u6e2c\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3068\u306f"]}

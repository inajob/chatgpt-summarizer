Now imagine that happening to your brain.\n[Markus M\u00f6llmann-Bohle] doesnt have to imagine it, because hes living it. [Markus] suffers from chronic cluster headaches, an often debilitating condition that leaves a person with intractable pain. Having lived with these headaches since 1987, and treating them with medications with varying degrees of success, [Markus] was finally delivered from his personal hell by a sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) neuromodulator. The device consists of an unpowered stimulator implanted under the cheekbone thats wired into the SPG, a bundle of nerves that supply the sinuses, nasal mucosa, tear glands, and many other structures in the face.\nTo reverse a cluster headache, [Markus] applies an external transmitter to the side of his face, which powers the implant and directs it to stimulate the SPG with low-frequency impulses, which interferes with a reflex loop that causes the symptoms associated with a cluster headache. [Markus] has been using the implant for years, but now its manufacturer has rolled up operations, leaving him with a transmitter in need of maintenance and the possibility of facing his debilitating headaches once again.\nThe video below shows [Markus]s workaround, which essentially amounts to opening up the device and swapping in a new LiPo battery pack. [Markus], an electrical engineer by training, admits its not exactly a major hack, but its keeping him going for now. But hes clearly worried because eventually, something will happen to that transmitter thats beyond his skills to repair.\nTheres cause for hope, though, as the intellectual property of the original implant company has been purchased by an outfit called Realeve, with the intention to continue support. That would be a lifesaver for [Markus] and everyone relying on this technology to live a normal life, so heres hoping theres no need for future hacking heroics. But as the video below details, there is a lot of neurotechnology out there, and the potential for having that bricked by a corporate decision has to be terrifying to the people who depend on them.\n\nThanks for the tip, [Perry].", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u3005\u306e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u306a\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u6162\u6027\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u982d\u75db\u3092\u62b1\u3048\u308b[Markus]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u75db\u307f\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u8133\u795e\u7d4c\u523a\u6fc0\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u9589\u9396\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u306b\u3088\u308a\u81ea\u5df1\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u306b\u9650\u308a\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30ec\u30fc\u306e\u4f01\u696dRealeve\u304c\u5143\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u7d99\u304e\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7d99\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u3068\u306e\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u3005\u306e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u306a\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u5f8c\u7d9a\u4f01\u696d\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3068\u3001\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7aef\u672b\u306f\u3069\u3046\u306a\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u8005\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u81ea\u8eab\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3055\u308c\u305f\u533b\u7642\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f ", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u4f1a\u793e\u304c\u5012\u7523\u3057\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306b\u63a5\u3059\u308b\u4ee3\u66ff\u624b\u6bb5"]}

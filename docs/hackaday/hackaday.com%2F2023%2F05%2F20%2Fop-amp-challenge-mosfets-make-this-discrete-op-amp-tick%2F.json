We tend to spec whatever does the job, and dont give much of a thought as to the internals. And while it doesnt make much sense to roll your own op-amp out of discrete components, that doesnt mean there isnt plenty to be learned from doing just that.\nWhile were more accustomed to seeing [Mitsuru Yamada]s digital projects, hes no stranger to the analog world. In fact, this project is a follow-on to his previous bipolar transistor op-amp, which we featured back in 2021. This design features MOSFETs rather than BJTs, but retains the same basic five-transistor topology as the previous work, with a differential pair input stage, a gain stage, and a buffer stage. Even the construction of the module is similar, using his trademark perfboard and ultra-tidy wiring.\nAlso new is a flexible evaluation unit for these discrete op-amp modules. This very sturdy-looking circuit provides an easy way to configure the op-amp for testing in inverting, non-inverting, and transimpedance mode, selecting from a range of feedback resistors, and even provides a photodiode input. The video below shows the eval unit in action with the CMOS module, as well as highlights the excellent construction [Mitsuru Yamada] is known for.\nLooking for some digital goodness?

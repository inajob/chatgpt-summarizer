Enabling everything from smartphones to electric cars, their ability to pack an incredible amount of energy into a lightweight package has been absolutely transformative over the last several decades. But like all technologies, there are downsides to consider  specifically, the need for careful monitoring during charging and discharging.\nAs hardware hackers, we naturally want to harness this technology for our own purposes. But many are uncomfortable about dealing with these high-powered batteries, especially when theyve been salvaged or come from some otherwise questionable origin. Which is precisely what the Smart Multipurpose Battery Tester from [Open Green Energy] is hoping to address.\n\nBased on community feedback, this latest version of the tester focuses primarily on the convenient 18650 cell  these are easily sourced from old battery packs, and the first step in reusing them in your own projects is determining how much life they still have left. By charging the battery up to the target voltage and then discharging it down to safe minimum, the tester is able to calculate its capacity.\nIt can also measure the cells internal resistance (IR), which can be a useful metric to compare cell health. Generally speaking, the lower the IR, the better condition the battery is likely to be in. That said, theres really no magic number youre looking for  a cell with a high IR could still do useful work in a less demanding application, such as powering a remote sensor.\nIf youre not using 18650s, dont worry. Theres a JST connector on the side of the device where you can connect other types of cells, such as the common pouch style batteries.\nThe open source hardware (OSHW) device is controlled by the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3, which has been combined with the LP4060 charger IC and a AP6685 for battery protection. The user interface is implemented on the common 0.96 inch 128X64 OLED, with three buttons for navigation. The documentation and circuit schematics are particularly nice, and even if youre not looking to build one of these testers yourself, theres a good chance you could lift the circuit for a particular sub-system for your own purposes.\nOf course, testing and charging these cells is only part of the solution. If you want to safely use lithium-ion batteries in your own home-built devices, theres a few things youll need to learn about. Luckily, [Arya Voronova] has been working on a series of posts that covers how hackers can put this incredible technology to work.\n"}

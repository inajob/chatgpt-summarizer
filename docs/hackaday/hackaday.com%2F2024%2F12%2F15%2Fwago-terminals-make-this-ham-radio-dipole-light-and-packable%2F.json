If youre lugging even a modest setup out into the woods, every ounce counts, which is why we love projects like this packable dipole antenna feedpoint.\nAt its simplest, a dipole antenna is just two pieces of wire cut to a specific, frequency-dependent length connected to a feedline. In practical terms, though, complications arise, such as keeping common-mode currents off the feedline and providing sturdy mechanical support for the antenna to suspend it safely. [Ham Radio Dude]s design handles both those requirements while staying as small and packable as possible. The design starts with a bifilar 1:1 current balun, which is wound on an FT82-43 ferrite toroid with 22 AWG magnet wire. One side of the balun is connected to a BNC connector while the other is connected to a pair of Wago splice connectors that are glued together. A loop of paracord for mechanical strain relief is added, and the whole thing gets covered in heat-shrink tubing. The antenna is deployed by attaching a feedline to the BNC, clipping quarter-wave wires into the Wago terminals, and hoisting the whole thing aloft. Full build details are in the video below.\nPeople will no doubt be quick to point out that these Wago terminals are rated for a minimum of 18 AWG wire, making them inappropriate for use with fine magnet wire. True enough, but [Dude] was able to get continuity through the Wagos, so the minimum gauge is probably more of an electrical code thing. Still, youll want to be careful that the connections stay solid, and it might pay to look at alternatives to the Wago brand, too.\n", "title": "- \u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u30d1\u30c3\u30ab\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u643a\u5e2f\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u69cb\u9020\u7684\u306b\u3082\u5b89\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u30d1\u30c3\u30ab\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u3068Wago\u7aef\u5b50\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u88fd\u4f5c\u6cd5", "- \u7c21\u6613\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "- \u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u3067\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5411\u3051\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1"]}

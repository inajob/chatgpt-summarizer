There are privacy concerns, of course. Plus they maddeningly dont always do what you intend for them to do. However, if you do have one, youve probably thought about something you wanted to do that would require programming. Sure, you can usually do a simple list, but really writing code wasnt on the menu. But now, Google Home will allow you to write code. Well, at least script using a YAML file.\nThe script language is available in the web app and if you opt in on the mobile app as well. Theres a variety of ways you can trigger scripts and many examples you can start with.\n\nThere are plenty of disclaimers:\nImportant: All household members can see when these Routines run. Routines are for convenience only, not safety- or security-critical use cases. Do not create Routines that could result in injury or harm if they fail to start or stop. Routines can depend on working internet, Wi-Fi, and service availability from both Google and the third parties who manufacture the devices included in Routines. Routines may not always work, and Google is not responsible for any harm or losses incurred as a result of any failed Routines.\nYou can tell the lawyers have been busy.\nWe can only wonder if this is a response to pressure from homebrew home automation systems? Either way, it is welcome to have more choices to have control over your home devices.\nOf course, if you are like us, youd probably prefer to roll your own. It has certainly never been easier."}

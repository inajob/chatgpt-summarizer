We dont know if hes acting or not, but he seems genuinely excited about every topic he covers, and it is infectious. He also has entertaining imaginary conversations with people like Feynman and Einstein. His recent video on tensors begins by showing the vector form of Ohms law, making it even more interesting. Check out the video below.\nIf you ever thought you could use fewer numbers for many tensor calculations, [FloatHeadPhysics] had the same idea. Luckily, imaginary Feynman explains why this isnt right, and the answer shows the basic nature of why people use tensors.\n\nThe spoiler: vectors and even scalars are just a special case of tensors, so you use tensors all the time, you just dont realize it. He works through other examples, including an orbital satellite and a hydroelectric dam.\nWe love videos that help us have aha moments about complex math or physics. It is easy to spew formulas, but theres no substitute for having a feeling about how things work.\nThe last time we checked in with [FloatHeadPhysics], he convinced us we were already travelling at the speed of light. Weve looked at a simple tensor explainer before, if you want a second approach.\n", "title": "- \u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\uff1aFloatHeadPhysics\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b", "body": "[FloatHeadPhysics]\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u306f\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3084\u7269\u7406\u3092\u697d\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3001\u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\uff1aFloatHeadPhysics\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b", "- \u7269\u7406\u5b66\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\uff1aFloatHeadPhysics\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u5b66\u3076", "- \u6570\u5b57\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\uff01\u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u8a08\u7b97\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8996\u70b9", "- \u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u6b63\u4f53\uff1a\u30d9\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u3084\u30b9\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u9023", "- \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3082\u77e5\u3089\u305a\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff01\u30c6\u30f3\u30bd\u30eb\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

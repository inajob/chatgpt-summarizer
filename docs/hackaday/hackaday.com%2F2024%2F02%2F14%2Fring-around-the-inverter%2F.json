In theory, it doesnt make sense, but depending on the gates physical construction, youll get into a strange state. The transistors within the gate will behave differently than they normally would, and youll wind up with an amplifier or an oscillator. You can see the results in the video below. In the second video, you can see what the odd connection does to the thermal properties of the inverter, too.\nThe CMOS inverter becomes biased in the active region, so it makes sense that it settles at the halfway point. The TTL inverter is slightly different, but the delay through the gate isnt enough to produce a good oscillation. However, an odd number of inverters connected in a ring like this is one way to create a simple oscillator.\n\nWhile we dont suggest this method, it is interesting to see what happens when you bias different gates this way. Weve certainly seen it done using a variety of different inverter types ranging from discrete transistor circuits to inverters on the die of an IC.\nWeve seen ring oscillators in a number of forms. Inverters can also make the phase-shifting part of a crystal oscillator.\n\n"}

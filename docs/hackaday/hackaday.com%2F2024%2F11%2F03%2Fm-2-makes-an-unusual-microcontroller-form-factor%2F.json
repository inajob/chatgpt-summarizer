Its a connector that offers much more than that interface though, making it suitable for some unexpected add-ons. As an example [MagicWolfi] has produced an m.2 card which contains the equivalent of a Raspberry Pi Pico.\nThe board itself has the familiar m.2 edge connector at the bottom, and the RP2040 GPIO lines as postage-stamp indentations round the edges. On the m.2 front is uses the USB interface as well as a UART and the I2C lines, as well as some of the interfaces were less familiar with such as ALERT, WAKE, DISABLE1/2, LED 1/2, and VENDOR_DEFINED.\nOn one level this provides a handy internal microcontroller card with which you can do all the things youd expect from a Pi Pico, but on another it provides the fascinating possibility of the Pico performing a watchdog or other function for the host device. We would be genuinely interested to hear more about the use of the m.2 slot in this way.\nIf youd like to know more about m.2, weve taken a look at it in more depth.", "title": "- M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5: Raspberry Pi Pico\u4e92\u63db\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "m.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fRaspberry Pi Pico\u4e92\u63db\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5: Raspberry Pi Pico\u4e92\u63db\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01M.2\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u306f", "- \u5185\u90e8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027: M.2\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068", "- M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u76e3\u8996\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- M.2\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u89e3\u8aac\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u691c\u8a0e"]}

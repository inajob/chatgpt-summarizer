It fills up twenty airplane-hangar-sized halls in Munich, and only takes place every two years.\nAnd what did we see on the wall in the Raspberry Pi department? One of the relatively new AI-enabled cameras running a real-time pose estimation demo, powered by nothing less than a brand-new Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5. And it seemed happy to be running without a heatsink, but we don\u2019t know how much load it was put under \u2013 most of the AI processing is done in the camera module.\nWe haven\u2019t heard anything about the CM5 yet from the Raspberry folks, but we can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s all that much to say except that they\u2019re getting ready to start production soon. The test board looks very similar to the RP4 CM demo board, so we imagine that the footprint hasn\u2019t changed. If you look really carefully, this one seems to have mouse bites on it that haven\u2019t been ground off, so we\u2019re speculating that this is still a pre-production unit, but feel free to generate wild rumors in the comment section.\nThe CM4 was a real change for the compute module series, coming with a brand-new pinout that enabled them to break out more PCIe lanes. Despite the special connectors, it wasn\u2019t all that hard to work with if you\u2019re dedicated. So if you need more computing power in that smaller form factor, we\u2019re guessing that you won\u2019t have to wait all that much longer!\nThanks [kuro] for the tip, and for walking around Electronica with me."}

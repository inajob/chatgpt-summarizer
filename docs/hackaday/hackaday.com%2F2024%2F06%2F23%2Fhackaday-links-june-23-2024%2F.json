Hospitals are supposed to be backstops for society, a place to go when it all goes wrong, and paralyzing their operations for monetary gain by taking over their information systems is just beyond the pale. Tactically, though, it makes sense; their unique position in society seems to make it more likely that theyll pay up.\nWhich is why  the ongoing cyberattack against car dealerships is a little perplexing  can you think of a less sympathetic victim apart from perhaps the Internal Revenue Service? Then again, were not in the ransomware business, so maybe this attack makes good financial sense. And really, judging by the business model of the primary target of these attacks, a company called CDK Global, it was probably a smart move. We had no idea that there was such a thing as a Dealer Management System that takes care of everything from financing to service, and that shutting down one companys system could cripple an entire industry, but there it is.\n\nWater may seem like the enemy for anyone who gets in trouble while swimming, but its really time that theyre fighting. Even a strong swimmer can quickly become exhausted fighting wind and waves; add in the hypothermia thatll eventually set in even in water as warm as a bath, and the difference between life and death can come down to seconds. Getting help to a floundering swimmer isnt easy, though, as lifeguards can only swim so fast.\nBut a new remotely operated rescue boat aims to change that, by getting to someone in trouble as fast as possible. Named EMILY, for Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard, the unit is a compact electrically powered rescue boat that can be rapidly deployed by lifeguards, who remotely pilot it to the victim. The boats deck is covered with what looks like survival gear, most of which would probably be of more use to the lifeguard upon their arrival than to the swimmer, who would likely just use the boat for flotation. As such, this makes way more sense than sending a drone out there, which at best could only drop a life ring. At $12,000 a piece, these boats arent cheap, but for the families who lost their kids in 2022 who donated them, they probably seem like quite a bargain. Heres hoping they pay off.\nWe cant be sure, but weve got a vague memory of playing a game called Lunar Landing way back in the day. It would likely have been on a TRS-80 in our local Radio Shack store, and if memory serves, we never got particularly good at the text-based simulator. Happily, though, we can now at least attempt to foist our lack of skills off on a 55-year-old bug in the software. Recently discovered by the excellently named Martin C. Martin while trying to optimize the fuel burn schedule to land softly with the most fuel remaining  the key to a high score, as we recall  the bug makes it so a tiny change in burn rate gives wildly different results. The post-mortem of his search and the analysis of the code, written by high school student Jim Storer only months after the real moon landing in 1969, is very interesting. We especially appreciated the insights into how Storer wrote it, revealed via personal communications. Its a great look at a piece of computer history, and hats off to both Storer and Martin  although we havent seen a CVE posted for this yet.\nWe know that Minitel terminals are highly collectible, but this is ridiculous. Granted, the Minitel occupies a unique place in computer history, and the boxy design of the original CRT and keyboard terminal was not without its charms. But this particular terminal seems to have had a Very Bad Day in the recent past and is now on the chopping block for a mere \u20ac430. To be fair, the eBay user in France has listed the Dal\u00ed-esque Minitel as an objet dart; at that price, wed like to at least get some usable parts from it to fix other terminals, but that doesnt seem likely. Somebody will probably buy it, though  no accounting for taste.\nAnd finally, AnimaGraffs is back, this time with a deep dive into the Bell 407 helicopter. Weve been big fans of his work for a while and have featured a few of his videos in this space, including his look inside the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. The new video is richly detailed and includes not only the engineering that goes into rotorcraft but also the physics that makes them work and makes them so challenging to fly. Enjoy!\n"}

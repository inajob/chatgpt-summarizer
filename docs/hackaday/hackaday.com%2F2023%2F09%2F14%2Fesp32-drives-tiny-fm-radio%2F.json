After all, blizzards, hurricanes, and other natural disasters can quickly take out both home and mobile Internet access. If youd like to have an FM radio with the absolute smallest footprint, take a look at this one built around an ESP32.\nWhile the radio uses the ESP32 as the main control board hosted by a TTGO T-Display board which adds a 1.14 inch ST7789V IPS panel, it also makes use of the TEA5767 chip for handling the FM radio signals. As [Volos Projects] has it programmed, the ESP32 stores five preset channels which can be toggled using two buttons at the bottom of the device. Theres also some circuitry to handle output to headphones or a stereo. \nFor making the radio even smaller, some of the audio processing could be done on the ESP32 instead, although its much simpler to take a slightly larger footprint and offload this to an audio processing chip. Since the source code for this project is open, modifications could be done including adding seek/tune functionality instead of relying only on presets. If youre not building this for emergencies, though, and your entire area is dominated by cookie cutter corporate-owned radio stations, an ESP32 with an internet connection is great for accessing better radio stations around the world.\n\n\nThanks to [Peter] for the tip!"}

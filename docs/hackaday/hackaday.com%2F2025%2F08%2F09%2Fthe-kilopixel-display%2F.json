In [Ben Holmen]s case the display he built is somewhat unusual and not the most practical, but for us a giant-sized wooden kilopixel display is exactly what the world needs.\nIts a kilopixel display because it has a resolution of 40 by 25 pixels, and it takes the form of a rack of wooden cubes, each of which can be turned by a tool on a gantry to expose either a black or a white side. Its very slow indeed  he has an over nine hour long video of it in operation  but it is an effective device.\nHis write-up goes into great detail about the steps taken in its design, starting with spherical pixels rotated by a LEGO wheel and progressing to cubes poked at their corner to rotate. The pusher in this case is a hot glue stick, for the required flexibility. For practicality were reminded of this serial oil-and-water display.\nThe whole thing is online, and if you want you can submit your own images for it to draw. Whether a Wrencher in 25 pixel resolution has enough detail, well leave to you.", "title": "- \u5de8\u5927\u6728\u88fd\u30ad\u30ed\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u6728\u88fd\u30ad\u30ed\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u3060\u304c\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5de8\u5927\u6728\u88fd\u30ad\u30ed\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u6311\u6226", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\uff1a40x25\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- DIY\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u6728\u88fd\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "- \u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6620\u50cf\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- LEGO\u3068\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5275\u9020\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

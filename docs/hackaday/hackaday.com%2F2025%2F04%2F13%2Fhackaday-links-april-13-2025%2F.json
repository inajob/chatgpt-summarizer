But that appears not to be the case after a Waymo robotaxi got stuck in a Chick-fil-A drive-through. The incident occurred at the chicken giants Santa Monica, California location at about 9:30 at night, when the autonomous Jaguar got stuck after dropping off a passenger in the parking lot. The car apparently tried to use the drive-through lane to execute a multi-point turn but ended up across the entrance, blocking other vehicles seeking their late-evening chicken fix. The drive-through-only restaurant ended up closing for a short time while Waymo figured out how to get the vehicle moving again.\n\nTo be fair, drive-through lanes are challenging even for experienced drivers. Lanes are often narrow, curve radii are sometimes tighter than a large vehicle can negotiate smoothly, and the task-switching involved with transitioning from driver to customer can lead to mistakes. Drive-throughs almost seem engineered to make tempers flare, especially at restaurants where hangry drivers are likely to act out at the slightest delay. This is probably doubly so when drivers are stuck behind a driverless car, completely eliminating even the minimal decency that would likely be extended to a human driver who got themselves in a pickle. If people are willing to honk at and curse out the proverbial little old lady from Pasadena, theyre very unlikely to cooperate with a robotaxi and give it the room it needs to maneuver out of a tight spot. Perhaps that argues for a change in programming that accounts for real-world driving experiences as well as the letter of the law.\nThe big news from space this week was the private Fram2 mission, which took an all-civilian crew on the worlds first crewed polar flight. The four-person crew took off from Florida in a SpaceX Crew Dragon and rather than heading east towards Africa, took off due north and entered a retrograde orbit at 90\u00b0 inclination, beating the previous record of 65\u00b0 inclination by Valentina Tereshkova aboard Vostok 6 back in 1963. The Fram2 team managed a couple of other firsts, from the first medical X-rays taken in space to the first amateur radio contacts made from the Dragon.\nIts been a while, but Bill The Engineer Guy Hammack is back with a new video extolling the wonders of plastic soda bottles. If you think thats a subject too mundane to hold your interest, then youve never seen Bill at work. The amount of engineering that goes into creating a container that can stand up to its pressurized content while being able to be handled both by automation machines at the bottling plant and by thirsty consumers is a lesson in design brilliance. Bill explains the whole blow-molding process, amazingly using what looks like an actual Coca-Cola production mold. We would have thought such IP would be fiercely protected, but such is Bills clout, we guess. The video is also a little trip down memory lane for some of us, as Bill shows off both the two-piece 2-liter bottles that used to grace store shelves and the ponderous glass versions that predated those. Also interesting is the look at the differences between hot-fill bottles and soda bottles, which we never appreciated before.\n\nAnd finally, if youve ever been confused by which logical fallacy is clouding your thinking, why not turn to the most famous fictional logician of all time to clarify things? Star Trek Logical Reasoning is a YouTube series by CHDanhauser that uses clips from the Star Trek animated series to illustrate nearly 70 logical fallacies. Each video is quite short, with most featuring Commander Spock eavesdropping on the conversations of his less-logical shipmates and pointing out the flaws in their logic. Luckily, the 23rd century seems to have no equivalent of human(oid) resources, because Spocks logical interventions are somewhat toxic by todays standards, but thats a small price to pay for getting your logical ducks in a row.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u304c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u3067\u5927\u6df7\u4e71\uff01", "body": "Waymo\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u304c\u30c1\u30ad\u30f3\u5e97\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u3067\u7acb\u3061\u5f80\u751f\u3002\u904b\u8ee2\u624b\u306e\u4e0d\u5728\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u304c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u3067\u5927\u6df7\u4e71\uff01", "\u521d\u306e\u6c11\u9593\u6709\u4eba\u6975\u98db\u884c\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30e02\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u6210\u529f", "\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u30d3\u30eb\u30fb\u30cf\u30de\u30c3\u30af", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u8ad6\u7406\u7684\u8aa4\u8b2c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u6280\u8853\u3078\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u6539\u5584\u70b9"]}

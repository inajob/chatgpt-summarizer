[Simone Giertz] built a flip clock moon phase tracker for a friend.\nWhile in Egypt for Cairo Maker Faire, [Giertz] and [dina Amin] found some old flip clocks at a flea market and had to have them. [Amin] mentioned wanting to make a moon phase tracker with one, and [Giertz] decided to try her hand at making her own version. A side quest in more comfortable flying is included with the price of admission, but the real focus is the process of figuring out how to replicate the flip clocks original mechanism in a different size and shape.\n[Giertz] cut out 30 semi-circle flaps from polystyrene and then affixed vinyl cut-outs to the flaps. The instructions for the assembly suggest that this might not be the best way to do it, and that printing stickers to affix to the flaps might work better since the cut vinyl turned out pretty fiddly. We really like the part where she built a grid jig to determine the optimal placement of the beams to keep the flaps in the right position after a disheartening amount of difficulties doing it in a more manual way. Her approach of letting it rest for twenty minutes before coming back to it is something you might find helpful in your own projects.\nBest of all, if you want to build your own, the files are available for the flip moon station on the Yetch website. Youll have to come up with your own method to drive it though as that isnt in the files from what we saw.\n\n", "title": "- \u6708\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "Simone Giertz\u304c\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u6708\u76f8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u4f5c\u696d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6708\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u6642\u8a08: \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- \u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5de5\u7a0b", "- \u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u30c1\u30ec\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u6708\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01"]}

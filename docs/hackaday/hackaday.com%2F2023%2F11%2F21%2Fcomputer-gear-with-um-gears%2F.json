One very obvious place they were used was in military vehicles. While submarine fire computers and the Norden bombsight get all the press, [msylvain59] has a lesser-known example: an M13A1 ballistic computer from an M48 tank that he tears down for us in the video below.\nThe M48, known as a Patton, saw service from 1952 to 1987. Just looking at the mechanical linkage to the tanks systems is impressive. But inside, it is clear this is a genuinely analog computer. The thing is built  quite literally  like a tank. What was the last computer you opened that needed a hammer? And inside, youll find gears, bearings, and a chain!\nWe dont pretend to understand all the workings. These devices often used gears and synchros (or selsyns, if you prefer) to track the position of some external thing. But we are guessing there was a lot more to it than that. Its probably an exciting process to see something like that designed from scratch.\nWe did think of the Norden when we saw this. Hard to imagine, but there were general purpose analog computers.\n\n"}

There is also a surge current rating of 200 A for thirty seconds, but that was not tested here.\n\nWhats interesting about the results here is that instead of the positive terminal getting visibly discolored as with the previous cases that we reported on, [Will] saw severe thermal effects on the side of the negative terminal to the point where the plastic enclosure was deforming due to severe internal heating.\nDuring testing, the first two charge-discharge cycles showed full capacity, but after that the measured capacity became extremely erratic until the battery kept disconnecting randomly. After letting the battery cool down and trying again with 80 A discharge current the negative terminal side of the enclosure began to melt, which was a good hint to stop testing. After this the battery also couldnt be charged any more by [Will]s equipment, probably due to the sketchy contact inside the battery.\nIts clear that the plastic spacer inside the terminal bus bar was once again the primary cause, starting a cascade which resulted in not only the enclosure beginning to char and melt, but with heat damage visible throughout the battery. Considering that the battery was used as specified, without pushing its limits, it seems clear that nobody should be using these batteries for anything until Battle Born fixes what appears to be the sketchiest terminal and bus bar design ever seen in a high-current battery.\n\n", "title": "- Battle Born\u306eLiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u71b1\u554f\u984c", "body": "Battle Born\u306eLiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u904e\u71b1\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u4e2d\u3001\u8ca0\u7aef\u5b50\u304c\u5909\u5f62\u30fb\u6eb6\u878d\u3057\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u304c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u306b\u3002\u6539\u5584\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- Battle Born\u306eLiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u71b1\u554f\u984c", "- \u8ca0\u306e\u7aef\u5b50\u306e\u5909\u5f62: LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u885d\u6483\u7684\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408: \u51b7\u5374\u5f8c\u3082\u7d9a\u304f\u7570\u5e38\u306a\u5bb9\u91cf\u306e\u5909\u52d5", "- \u9ad8\u96fb\u6d41\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u6b20\u9665\u3068\u71b1\u640d\u50b7\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "- Battle Born\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u3092\u4fc3\u3059\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c"]}

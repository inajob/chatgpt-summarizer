Both fine platforms, but oddly the elephant in the 16-bit room has become a victim of its own success. DOS, the granddaddy of all PC operating systems, seems oddly overshadowed by its 68000-based competitors in a way it certainly wasnt back in the day. Perhaps its the often-atrocious graphics when cards designed for business graphics were pressed into gaming service, but its easy to forget that DOS PCs were the powerhouses of their day. They still pack a punch even in 2023, as [Lunduke] is here to show us by running a DOS web server. Take that, nginx!\nThree letter file extensions for the win!\nWhile Microsoft and IBM abandoned DOS a very long time ago, the OS lives on in the form of the well-maintained open-source equivalent, FreeDOS. Its a lifeline for people with DOS-era hardware to maintain as much as it is a favourite in retrocomputing, thus its the obvious place to start when installing a web server.\nIts a while since we navigated the many layers of DOS packet drivers and TCP stacks, but this guide implies that the FreeDOS folks have made it a much nicer process than it used to be. He installs the Sioux and WebServ web servers to compare two different options, configures the network, and hey presto!, a web page!\nWe can see that theres little real-world value in running an internet-connected website from a 16-bit machine using nearly 20-year-old unmaintained software with no server-side processing capabilities here in 2023, but thats not the point. DOS may be antiquated, but its still capable, its very adaptable and configurable, and its still just about relevant. We can completely see the fun in making it do unexpected things not because it needs to, but because its there.\nWant more DOS fun?

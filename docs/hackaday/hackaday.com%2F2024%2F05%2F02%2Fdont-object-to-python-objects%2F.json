The Arduino system is a good example of this. Most people use it like a C compiler. However, it really uses C++, and if you want to provide things to the tool users, you need to create objects. For example, when you put Serial in a program, you use an object someone else wrote. Python  and things like Micropython  have the same kind of division. Python started as a scripting language, but it has added object features, allowing a rich set of tools for scripters to use. [Damilola Oladele] shows the ins and outs of object-oriented Python in a recent post.\nLike other languages, Python allows you to organize functions and data into classes and then create instances that belong to that class. Class hierarchies are handy for reusing code, customizing behavior, and  through polymorphism  building device driver-like architectures.\n\nFor example, you might build a class for temperature sensors and then create specialized subclasses for different specific sensors. The code to convert the sensor reading to degrees would live in each subclass. However, common code, such as getting an average of several samples, could be used in the main class. Even more importantly, any part of your code that needs a temperature sensor will just deal with the main class and wont care what kind of sensor is actually in use except, of course, when you instantiate the sensor.\nPythons implementation of object orientation does have a few quirks. For example, if you create a class variable, it can be read from a subclass without specifying scope like youd expect. But if you try to write to it from a subclass, you create a new variable for that particular subclass, which then hides the parent class version.\nStill, objects can make your tools and libraries much more reusable, and Python makes it relatively easy compared to some other languages. If you want to see how objects can improve common constructs like state tables, youll have to read a different language.

Its a low-down feet-forward machine with, were told, Ceramic double-rotor two-wheel drive, which were guessing is some kind of hybrid electric drive with what sounds like a gas-turbine motor. Over the years, there have been a few different attempts to create a real version of Kanedas bike, and were pleased to see the latest from \u30f2\u30bf\u5de5\u623f\u300c\u30dd\u30f3\u3061\u3083\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u300d(Ota Kobo Ponchanner). It uses a twin-cylinder Kawasaki motor in an entirely custom-made frame, with dual single-sided swingarms front and rear and hub-centre steering.\nThe full build in the video below the break is pretty long but well worth a watch, and it includes a lot of very highly skilled metalwork. Its an interesting choice not to attempt to make a direct replica of Kanedas bike. Still, we think some of the differences are dictated by this being very much a roadworthy and everyday-rideable machine.\n\nAs is usually the case with these builds, as far as we can see, it has two chains and a rotor somewhere under the seat to get the drive under the rider. To replicate the originals steering action, theres a complex linkage at the front. The body panels are fabricated in stainless steel to a very high standard, and we particularly like the pop-out centre stand.\nWeve hoped for years that the arrival of hub-centre electric motors with useful quantities of power will revitalise the narrow field of Kaneda bike builds, and indeed, there seems to be someone building just that for sale. Meanwhile, we think this one is about the pinnacle of the art when it comes to internal combustion models. It seems attendees of a Japanese motorcycle show agree with us.\nIf you dont know the original bike, this video should educate you. Once you build this, you only need an anime holographic assistant. If you prefer your motorcycles more old-school, thats another possible build.\n", "title": "Akira\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30ab\u30cd\u30c0\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u30f2\u30bf\u5de5\u623f\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300cAKIRA\u300d\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u3001\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u304c\u65bd\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30ec\u30b9\u88fd\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306a\u3069\u7279\u5fb4\u7684\u306a\u4ed5\u69d8\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3082\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Akira\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30ab\u30cd\u30c0\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u30f2\u30bf\u5de5\u623f\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30cf\u30d6\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30af", "\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1Akira\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u73fe\u5b9f\u7248\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d0\u30a4\u30af", "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30ea\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3001\u9053\u8def\u8d70\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ab\u30cd\u30c0\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30af"]}

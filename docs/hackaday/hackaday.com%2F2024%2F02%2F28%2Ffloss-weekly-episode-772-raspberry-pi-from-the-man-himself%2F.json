The conversation covers the new Pi 5, the upcoming CM5, the possible Pi500, and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) that may happen before too long. Theres also the PCIe port, the RP1, and the unexpected effects of using Broadcom chips. And then we ask the Billion Dollar question: Whats the money from an IPO going to fund? New hardware, software upgrades, better documentation? Nope, and the answer surprised us, too.\n\n\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord?

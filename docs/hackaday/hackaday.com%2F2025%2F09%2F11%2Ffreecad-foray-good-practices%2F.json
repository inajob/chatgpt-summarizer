It went well, and Id like to believe you that the article will give you a much-needed easy-to-grasp FreeCAD introduction, Matrix knowledge upload style, having you designing stuff in no time.\nApart from my firm belief in the power of open-source software, I also do believe in social responsibilities, and I think I have a responsibility to teach you some decent FreeCAD design practices Ive learned along the way. Some of them are going to protect your behind from mistakes, and some of them will do that while also making your project way easier to work with, for you and others.\nYou might not think the last part about others matters, but for a start, it matters in the ideal world that were collectively striving towards, and also, lets be real, things like documentation are half intended for external contributors, half for you a year later. So, heres the first FreeCAD tip that will unquestionably protect you while helping whoever else might work with the model later.\nOkay, were all hackers, so Ill start with zero-th FreeCAD tip  press Ctrl+S often. Thatll help a ton. Thankfully, FreeCADs autorecovery system has made big leaps, and its pretty great in case FreeCAD does crash, but the less you have to recover, the better. Now, onto the first tip.\n\nName Your Bodies, Always\nThe button is F2. Thats it. Click on your models in the tree view and give them a name. Do it for all extrudes, cuts, and even fillets/chamfers. You dont have to do it for sketches, since those are always contained within an extrusion. If at all possible, do it immediately, make it a habit.\nWhy? Because names make it clear what the extrusion/cut/fillet is for, and youll be thankful for it multiple times over when modifying your model or even just looking at it the next morning. Also, it makes it way easier to avoid accidentally sending the wrong 3D model to your printer.\nTheyre the same picture.\nHow to make naming easier? Ive figured out an easy and apt naming scheme, that youve seen in action in the previous article. For Fusions, I do primary object +addition or with addition, mentioning just the last addition. So, Bottom case +cutouts is a cut that contains Bottom case +logo and Cutouts, Bottom case +logo is a cut that contains Bottom case and Logo, and Bottom case contains Bottom floor and Bottom walls.\nIts not a perfect scheme, but it avoids verbosity and you have to barely think of the names. Dont shy away from using words like pip and doohickey if the word just doesnt come to your mind at the moment  youre choosing between a project thats vaguely endearing and one thats incomprehensible, so the choice is obvious. Naming your models lets you avoid them becoming arcane magic, which might sound fun at a glance until you realize theres already an object of arcane magic in your house, its called a 3D printer, and youve had enough arcane magic in your life.\nLast but not least, to hack something is know learn its true name, and whatever your feature is, theres no truth in Cut034. By the way, about FreeCAD and many CAD packages before it, theyve been having a problem with true names, actually, its a whole thing called Topological Naming Problem.\nNaming Is Hard, Topology Is Harder\nHow do you know where a feature really is? For instance, you take a cube, and you cut two slots into the same side. How does the CAD package ensure that the slots are on the same side? One of the most popular options for it is topological naming. So, a cube gets its faces named Face1 through Face6, and as you slowly turn that cube into, say, a Minecraft-style hand showing a middle finger, each sketch remembers the name of the side you wanted it attached to.\nNow, imagine the middle finger hand requires a hole inside of it, and it has to be done at from very start, which means you might need to go back to the base cube and add that hole. All of a sudden, there will be four new faces to the internal cube that holds the finger sketches, and these new faces will need names, too. Best case, theyll be named Face7 through Face10  but thats a best case and the CAD engine needs to ensure to always implement it properly, whereas real world models arent as welcoming. Worst case, the faces will be renumbered anew, the sketch-to-face mapping will change which faces get which names, and the model of the hand will turn into a spider. Spooky!\nIts not Halloween just yet, and most regretfully, people dont tend to appreciate spiders in unexpected places. Even more sadly, this retrospective renaming typically just results in your sketches breaking in a red exclamation mark way, since its not just sketch-to-face mappings that get names, its also all the little bits of external geometry that youll definitely invoke if you want to avoid suffering. Every line in your sketch has an invisible name and a number, and external geometry lines will store  otherwise, they couldnt get updated when you change the base model under their feet, as one inevitably does.\nBefore FreeCAD v1.0, I sometimes had to make plug solids instead of removing cutouts. Nowadays, I have to do that way less often.\nThis used to be a big problem with FreeCAD, and it still kind of is, but its by no means exclusive to FreeCAD. Hell, I remember dealing with something similar back when my CAD (computer-aided despair) suite of choice was SolidWorks. Its not an easy problem to solve, because of the innumerable ways you can create and then modify a 3D object; every time you think youll have figured out a solution to the horrors, your users will come up with new and more intricate horrors beyond your comprehension.\nFreeCAD v1.0 has clamped down on a large amount of topological naming errors. They still exist; one simple way I can trigger it is to make a cutout in a cube, make a sketch that external-geometry-exports the cut-in-half outwards-facing line of the cube, and then go back and delete the cutout. It makes sense that it happens, but oh do I wish it didnt, and it makes for unfun sketch fixing sessions.\nHow To Stay Well Away\nNow, Im no stranger to problems caused by name changes, and Im eager to share some of what Ive learned dealing with FreeCADs names in particular.\nThe first solution concerns cutouts, as they specifically might become the bane of your model. If you have a ton of features planned, just delay doing the cutouts up until youve done all the basics of the case that you might ever want to rely on. Cutouts might and often will change, and if your board changes connector or button positions, you want to be able to remake them without ever touching the rest of the sketch. So, build up most of your model, and closer to the end, do the case cutouts, so that external geometry can rely on walls and sides that will never change.\nNext, minimize the number of models youre dealing with, so that you have less places where external geometry has to be involved. If you need to make a block with a hole all the way through, do it in one sketch instead of doing two extrudes and a cut. Youll thank yourself, both because youll have less opportunity for topo naming errors, but also because you have fewer model names to think up.\nIn case you wondered what the bad naming example was about, its from this part. Its a perfectly fine part because no external geometry relies on it in practice, but its also absolutely a good example of a part you can instead do in a single sketch-extrude and a (not shown) fillet.\nThe third thing is what I call the cockroach rule. If you see a cockroach in your house, you back off slowly, set the house on fire, and then you get yourself a different house, making sure you dont bring the cockroach into the new house while at it. Same can apply here  if you remove a feature in the base model and you see the entire tree view light up with red exclamation marks, click Close on the document, press Discard changes, open the document again, and do whatever you wanted to do but in a different way.\nWhy reload? Because Ctrl+Z does not always help with such problems, as much as its supposed to. This does require that you follow the 0th rule  press Ctrl+S often, and it also requires that you dont press Ctrl+S right after making those changes, so, change-verify-enter. Thankfully, FreeCAD will unroll objects in the model tree when one of the inner object starts to, so just look over the model tree after doing changes deep inside the model, and youll be fine. This is also where keeping your models in a Git repo is super helpful  that way, you can always have known-good model states to go back to.\nGood Habits Create Good Models\nSo, to recap. Save often, give your models names, understand topo naming, create cutouts last if at all possible, keep your models simple, and when all fails, nuke it from orbit and let your good habits cushion the fall. Simple enough.\nIll be on the lookout for further tips for you all, as Ive got a fair few complex models going on, and the more I work with them, the more I learn. Until then, I hope you can greatly benefit from these tips, and may your models behave well through your diligent treatment.", "title": "\u300cFreeCAD\u306e\u57fa\u672c\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e5\u3064\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "body": "FreeCAD\u3067\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\uff1a\u983b\u7e41\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3001\u540d\u524d\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u5358\u7d14\u306b\u4fdd\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cFreeCAD\u306e\u57fa\u672c\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e5\u3064\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eFreeCAD\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\uff1a\u540d\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u300d", "\u300cFreeCAD\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u540d\u4ed8\u3051\u3068\u30c8\u30dd\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\uff01FreeCAD\u3067\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08\u6cd5\u300d"]}

In decades past these were readily available from almost any scrap radio, but the varicap diode and then the PLL have removed the need for them in consumer electronics. There have been various attempts at building variable capacitors, and heres [radiofun232] with a novel approach.\nA traditional tuning capacitor has a set of meshed semicircular plates that have more of their surface facing each other depending on how far their shaft is turned. The capacitor presented in the first video below has two plates joined by a hinge in a similar manner to the covers of a book. Its made of tinplate, and the plates can be opened or closed by means of a screw.\nThe result is a capacitor with a range from 50 to 150 picofarads, and in the second video we can see it used with a simple transistor oscillator to make a variable frequency oscillator. This can form the basis of a simple direct conversion receiver.\nWe like this device, its simple and a bit rough and ready, but its a very effective. If youd like to see another unusual take on a variable capacitor, take a look at this one using drinks cans.\n\n\n"}

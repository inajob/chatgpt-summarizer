Thirty-two years on, [Neil] at The Retro Collective remains haunted by the memories  specifically, the memory of BlitzBasic 2, an Amiga-specific programming language he never found the time to use. What better time to make a game for the Amiga than the year 2025 of the common era?\n[Neil] takes us on a long journey, with more than a little reminiscing along the way. BlitzBasic may not have been the main programming language for the Amiga, but it was by no means the least, with a good pedigree that included the best-selling 1993 game Skidmarks. Obviously BlitzBasic was not a slow, interpreted language as one might think hearing BASIC. Not only is it a compiled language, it was fast enough to be billed as the next best thing to C for the Amiga, according to [Neil].\n[Neil] wasnt the only one whose dreams have been haunted by the rugose touch of the Amiga and its scquomose BlitzBasic language youll find a version on GitHub called AmiBlitz3 that is maintained by [Sven] aka [honitas] to this day, complete with an improved IDE. The video includes a history lesson on the open-source AmiBlitz, and enough information to get you started.\nFor the vibe-coders amongst you, [Neil] has an excellent tip that you can use LLMs like ChatGPT to help you learn niche languages like this not by asking for code (which isnt likely to give you anything useful, unless youve given it special training) but by requesting techniques and psudocode you can then implement to make your game. The LLM also proved a useful assistent for [Neil]s excel-based pixel art workflow.\nIf youre wondering why bother, well, why not? As [Neil] says, writing Amiga games is his version of a crossword puzzle. It may also be the only way to keep the dreams at bay. Others have taken to writing new operating systems\u00a0 or reproducing PCBs to keep vintage Amiga hardware alive. If some gather under the light of the full moon to chant Ia! Ia! Commodore fthagan well, perhaps we can thank them for Commodore for rising from the sunless depths of bankruptcy once again.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\uff1aBlitzBasic\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u65c5", "body": "\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3092\u8a9e\u308bNeil\u304cBlitzBasic\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u8a08\u753b\u3002\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\uff1aBlitzBasic\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u65c5", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aAmiga\u3068BlitzBasic\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa", "- AmiBlitz3\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bAmiga\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u74b0\u5883", "- LLM\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u624b\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\u3068\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d99\u627f"]}

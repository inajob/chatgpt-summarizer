The tungsten wire cathode with its oxide coating produces the electrons whenever the relatively low supply voltage is applied, with a positively charged grid between it and the phosphors on the anode side inducing the accelerating force.\nAlthough a few different digit control configurations exist, all VFDs follow this basic layout. The reason why theyre also called cold cathode displays is because the cathode doesnt heat up nearly as hot as those of a typical vacuum tube, at a mere 650 \u00b0C. Since this temperature is confined to the very fine cathode mesh, this is not noticeable outside of the glass envelope.\nWhile LCDs and OLED displays have basically eradicated the VFD market, these phosphor-based displays still readily beat out LCDs when it comes to viewing angles, lack of polarization filter, brightness and low temperature performance, as LC displays become extremely sluggish in cold weather. Perhaps their biggest flaw is the need for a vacuum to work, inside very much breakable glass, as this is usually how VFDs die.\n\n", "title": "- \u771f\u7a7a\u86cd\u5149\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\uff08VFD\uff09\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u771f\u7a7a\u86cd\u5149\u8868\u793a\u5668\uff08VFD\uff09\u306f\u4f4e\u96fb\u529b\u304b\u3064\u8996\u8a8d\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u58ca\u308c\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u771f\u7a7a\u86cd\u5149\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\uff08VFD\uff09\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- VFD\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- VFD\u3068\u30ab\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30a4\u7ba1\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304c\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\uff1f", "- VFD\u306e\u5229\u70b9\uff1a\u8996\u91ce\u89d2\u3068\u5bd2\u51b7\u5730\u3067\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u5bff\u547d\uff1aVFD\u304c\u62b1\u3048\u308b\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

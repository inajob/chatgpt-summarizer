[Hikari-no-yume] wrote a sweet high-level emulator, touchHLE, to do so on modern iOS phones. But maybe you don\u2019t have an iPhone? [Ciciplusplus] has your back. He ported the iPhone OS emulator, written in Rust, to Android, and then ported a version of DOOM that runs on iPhone OS to go with it.\n[Ciciplusplus] also made a video (embedded below) where he documented the trials and tribulations of porting Rust code to the Android platform \u2013 an intensely Java environment. It doesn\u2019t sound like it was at all trivial. Of course, this couldn\u2019t have been accomplished without [Hikari-no-yume]\u2019s original work on touchHLE, which was made essentially to fulfill [Hikari-no-yume]\u2019s long-time obsession with the game Super Monkey Ball.\nSo for now, touchHLE runs a few old 32-bit games, but it does so on Android and iOS. What other games from the first years of gaming on smart phones (and iPods) do you need to see ported? Get involved in the project if you\u2019ve got an itch you need scratched.\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3084iPod\u306e\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u307f\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u3078\u3001iPhone OS\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092Android\u306b\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f", "body": "iOS\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304cAndroid\u306b\u3082\u79fb\u690d\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u904a\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002\u95a2\u4e0e\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3084iPod\u306e\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u307f\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u3078\u3001iPhone OS\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092Android\u306b\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f", "Rust\u3067\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u305fiPhone OS\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092Android\u306b\u79fb\u690d\uff01", "Android\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65e7\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\uff01", "touchHLE\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001Android\u3068iOS\u3067\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u904a\u307c\u3046", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u521d\u671f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3057\u305f\u3044\uff01\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\uff1f"]}

While the units do contain some interesting elements like the embedded projector, its all locked down tight, and the cloud services that tie it all together no longer exist. The devices technically still work, they just cant do much of anything.\nThe Humane AI Pin had some bold ideas, like an embedded projector. (Image credit: Humane)\nSince then, developers like [Adam Gastineau] have been hard at work turning the device into an experimental development platform: PenumbraOS,\u00a0which provides a means to allow untrusted applications to perform privileged operations.\nAs announced earlier this month on social media, the experimental SDK lets developers treat the pin as a mostly normal Android device, with the addition of a modular, user-facing assistant app called MABL. [Adam] stresses that this is all highly experimental and has a way to go before it is useful in a user-facing sort of way, but there is absolutely a workable architecture.\nWhen the Humane AI Pin launched, it aimed to compete with smartphones but failed to impress much of anyone. As a result, things folded in record time. Humanes founders took jobs at HP and buyers were left with expensive paperweights due to the highly restrictive design.\nThankfully, a load of reverse engineering has laid the path to getting some new life out of these ambitious devices. The project could sure use help from anyone willing to pitch in, so if thats up your alley be sure to join the project; youll be in good company."}

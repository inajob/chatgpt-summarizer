As the name implies, it started life as a Python tool for generating parametric boxes that could be assembled from laser-cut material, but has since become an invaluable online resource for all sorts of laser projects. Plus, you can still use it for making boxes.\nBut even if youve been using boxes.py for awhile, you might not know it was actually an entry in the Hackaday Prize back in 2017. Creator [Florian Festi] has kept up with the projects Hackaday.io page all this time, using it as a sort of development blog, and his recent retrospective on 2024 is a fascinating read for anyone with an eye towards hot photonic action.\n\nIn it, he describes a bevy of new designs that have come to the site, many of which have been developed either by or in conjunction with the community. For example, a new tool for generating IKEA-like pegboard is sure to be useful for the better organized among us. The last twelve months also saw the addition of a parametric air filter box, LEGO sorters, storage bins, book holders, bird feeders, and plenty more.\nAt the end, [Florian] has some interesting thoughts on how the community as a whole has developed over the years. He notes that in the early days, any code or designs proposed by users for inclusion in the project usually needed work before they were ready for prime time. But now that everything is more established, the pull requests hes getting are so well done that they rival any of the original work he put in.\nWere glad to hear that the community is coming together to make this already fantastic project even better. It sounds like [Florian] is even getting some help to track down and eliminate the remaining Python 2.x code thats still lingering around.\nHeres to many more excellent years for Boxes.py!", "title": "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01boxes.py\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "body": "boxes.py\u306f\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u5171\u306b\u9032\u5316\u4e2d\u3002\u65b0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u591a\u304f\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01boxes.py\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "- boxes.py\uff1a\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u65b0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u7d9a\u3005\u767b\u5834\uff01boxes.py\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01box.py\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u529b\uff01boxes.py\u306e\u6210\u9577\u3068\u672a\u6765\u5c55\u671b"]}

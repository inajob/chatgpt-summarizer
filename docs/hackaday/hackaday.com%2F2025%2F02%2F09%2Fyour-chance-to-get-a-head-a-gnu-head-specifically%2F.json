You can bid on the original sketch of the GNU head by [Etienne Suvasa] and [Richard Stallmans] Internet Hall of Fame medal.\nThere are some other awards, including the FSFs 1999 Norbert Wiener Award. Theres even a katana that symbolizes the fight for computer user freedom.\n\nThe FSF has done a lot of important work to shape the computing world as we know it. We hope this sale isnt a sign that they are running out of money. Maybe they are just funding their birthday party in Boston.\nIf you use Linux (even if it is disguised as Android, a Raspberry Pi OS, or hiding on a web server you use), you can thank the FSF. While we commonly call them Linux systems, Linux is just the kernel. Most of the other things you use are based on either GNU-sponsored code or builds on that GNU-sponsored code. If you want to know more about the history of the organization, you can catch [ForrestKnights] video below.\nWithout the GNU tools and the Linux kernel, you have to wonder what our computers would look like. While [Richard Stallman] is a sometimes controversial figure, you cant argue that the FSF has had a positive impact on our computers. Maybe wed all be on BSD. It is worth noting that the FSF even certifies hardware.\n", "title": "- FSF\u5275\u7acb40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3046\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u50ac", "body": "\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8ca1\u56e3\u304c\u8a2d\u7acb40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u8a18\u5ff5\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u958b\u50ac\u3002GNU\u306e\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u3084\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb\u306a\u3069\u304c\u51fa\u54c1\u3055\u308c\u3001\u540c\u8ca1\u56e3\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u3092\u898b\u76f4\u3059\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3068\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- FSF\u5275\u7acb40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3046\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u50ac", "- GNU\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u3068\u7279\u5225\u8cde\u306e\u51fa\u54c1", "- \u81ea\u7531\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8c61\u5fb4\uff1a\u30ab\u30bf\u30ca\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- Linux\u3068GNU\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308d\u3046", "- FSF\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u5f79\u5272\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b"]}

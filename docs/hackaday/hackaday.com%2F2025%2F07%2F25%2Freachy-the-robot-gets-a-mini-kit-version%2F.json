The kit is available from Hugging Face, which is itself a repository and hosting service for machine learning models. Reachy seems to be one of their efforts at branching out from pure software.\nOur guess is that some form of Stewart Platform handles the head movement.\nReachy Mini is intended as a development platform, allowing people to make and share models for different behaviors, hence the Hugging Face integration to make that easier. On the inside of the full version is a Raspberry Pi, and we suspect some form of Stewart Platform is responsible for the movement of the head. Theres also a cheaper (299 USD) lite version intended for tethered use, and a planned simulator to allow development and testing without access to a physical Reachy at all.\nReachy has a distinctive head and face, so if youre thinking it looks familiar thats probably because we first covered Reachy the humanoid robot as a project from Pollen Robotics (Hugging Face acquired Pollen Robotics in April 2025.)\nThe idea behind the smaller Reachy Mini seems to be to provide a platform to experiment with expressive human communication via cameras and audio, rather than to be the kind of robot that moves around and manipulates objects.\nIts still early in the project, so if you want to know more you can find a bit more information about Reachy Mini at Pollens site and you can see Reachy Mini move in a short video, embedded just below.\n\n", "title": "- AI\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cReachy Mini\u300d", "body": "Reachy Mini\u306fAI\u5b9f\u9a13\u7528\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3001Hugging Face\u304b\u3089\u8ca9\u58f2\u3002\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u306e\u5bfe\u8a71\u3084\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u8a66\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- AI\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cReachy Mini\u300d", "- Hugging Face\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u8868\u73fe\u529b\u8c4a\u304b\u306a\u4eba\u9593\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u305fReachy Mini", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0", "- Reachy Mini\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

Not all DSKYs ended up in space, however, with the MIT hosting a simulator that features one of these units. Unfortunately the unit that ended up at [CuriousMarc]s lab had seen better days, with the assumption being that it was the same DSKY that was installed in a photo of the old simulator. In addition to the busted EL display and two (improper) replacement keys, the insides show signs of damaged modules and possibly worse.\nWithout bothering to hook the unit up to the (previously restored) guidance computer, a full teardown was begun to assess the full extent of the damage. Considering that the DSKY uses latching relays for memory and two modules were ominously marked as being defective, this made for a tense wait as the unit was disassembled.\nFortunately making new DSKY-style EL displays has first been replicated in 2019, meaning that a replacement is possible. Perhaps surprisingly, the busted display still fires up in the test rig, as a testament to how robust the technology is. At the end of the teardown, the assessment is that the unit can be restored to its original condition, which will be done in the upcoming videos in this series.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u3068\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u624b\u6bb5\u300cDSKY\u300d", "body": "Apollo\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u7528DSKY\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4fee\u5fa9\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u3068\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u624b\u6bb5\u300cDSKY\u300d", "- MIT\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u305fDSKY\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u6545\u969c\u3057\u305fDSKY\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044DSKY\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306eEL\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u518d\u751f\u7523\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "- DSKY\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u4f5c\u696d\u3068\u305d\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u8ffd\u3046"]}

Did you know that this happens every two years?\nThen its time for a new Whats That Sound, and although Kristina had an interesting albeit somewhat prompted guess, she was, of course, wrong.\nAnd then its on to the hacks, beginning with a really cool digital pen that packs all the sensors. We learned about the worlds largest musical instrument, and compared it to the Zadar Sea Organ in Croatia, which if youll recall was once a Whats That Sound.\nFrom there we take a look at fake buck converters, radioactive water as a health fad, and a garage door company that has decided to take their ball and go home. Finally we talk about how slippery neutrinos are, and discuss Toms time at JawnCon.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 244 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nSolar conjunction halts communications between Mars missions and NASA\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out the form, place yer bets!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nD-POINT: A Digital Pen With Optical-Inertial Tracking\nVirginia Cave Is The Largest Musical Instrument In The World\n\nSea Organ \u2013 Zadar, Croatia  Atlas Obscura\nZadar Sea Organ  YouTube\n\n\nCheap Power Supplies With Fake Chips Might Not Be That Bad\nRadioactive Water Was Once A (Horrifying) Health Fad\n\nThe Radioactive Source Missing In Australian Desert Has Been Found\n\n\nDoes Getting Into Your Garage Really Need To Be Difficult?\n\nCory Doctorow: An Audacious Plan to Halt the Internets Enshittification and Throw It Into Reverse  YouTube\nGitHub  Kaldek/rat-ratgdo: Open source schematics for ratgdo PCB\n\n\n3D Printed Stamp Rollers\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nSolder Two Boards At Once With This Dual Reflow Plate\nPutting 3D Printed Screw Threads To The Test\nNeopixels?

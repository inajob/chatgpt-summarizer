The situation has improved considerably for the hobbyist, but a real scope can still cost more than what a beginner is looking to spend. Luckily, plenty of modern microcontrollers are capable of acting as a basic oscilloscope in a pinch, provided theres a display available to interface with it. Combined with the right software, the Wio Terminal looks like a promising option.\nThe Wio Terminal is a platform gaining some popularity due to its fairly capable SAMD51 microcontroller and also its integration with a display and a number of input buttons. On the hardware side, [mircemk] mounted the Terminal in a convenient vertical orientation and broke out a pair of connectors for the inputs.\nBut its the software that really makes this project work. [Play With Microcontroller] originally developed the firmware for the PIC24 back in 2017, but ported the code over to the Wio Terminal a couple years back. Noting that the microcontroller is not particularly fast, the project doesnt exactly match the specifications or capabilities of a commercial unit. But still, it does an impressive job of recreating the experience of using a modern digital scope\nThe Wio Terminal is a device weve seen around here for a few unique projects, among them a device for preventing repetitive strain injuries while using a computer mouse and another that is a guide for game development in MicroPython. And if youre just itching to port oscilloscope software to accessible but under-powered microcontrollers, be sure to check out [mircemk]s other oscilloscope projects like this one built around the STM32 microcontroller.\n\n"}

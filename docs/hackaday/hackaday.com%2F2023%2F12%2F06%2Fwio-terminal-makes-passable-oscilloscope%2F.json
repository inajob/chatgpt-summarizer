The situation has improved considerably for the hobbyist, but a real scope can still cost more than what a beginner is looking to spend. Luckily, plenty of modern microcontrollers are capable of acting as a basic oscilloscope in a pinch, provided theres a display available to interface with it. Combined with the right software, the Wio Terminal looks like a promising option.\nThe Wio Terminal is a platform gaining some popularity due to its fairly capable SAMD51 microcontroller and also its integration with a display and a number of input buttons. On the hardware side, [mircemk] mounted the Terminal in a convenient vertical orientation and broke out a pair of connectors for the inputs.\nBut its the software that really makes this project work. [Play With Microcontroller] originally developed the firmware for the PIC24 back in 2017, but ported the code over to the Wio Terminal a couple years back. Noting that the microcontroller is not particularly fast, the project doesnt exactly match the specifications or capabilities of a commercial unit. But still, it does an impressive job of recreating the experience of using a modern digital scope\nThe Wio Terminal is a device weve seen around here for a few unique projects, among them a device for preventing repetitive strain injuries while using a computer mouse and another that is a guide for game development in MicroPython. And if youre just itching to port oscilloscope software to accessible but under-powered microcontrollers, be sure to check out [mircemk]s other oscilloscope projects like this one built around the STM32 microcontroller.\n\n", "title": "Wio Terminal\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Wio Terminal\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u5099\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Wio Terminal\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wio Terminal\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u7528\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wio Terminal\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wio Terminal\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "STM32\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3068Wio Terminal\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

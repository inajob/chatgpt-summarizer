Their boundless optimism and confidence in whatever product they are advancing is infectious, even though from time to time with hindsight we know that to have been misplaced.\nFor once though the subject of todays film isnt something problematic, instead its a thing we still rely on today. Precision manufacturing of almost anything still relies on precision tooling, and the National Tool and Die Manufacturers Association is on hand in the video from 1953 below the break to remind us of the importance of their work.\nThe products on show all belie the era in which the film was made: a metal desk fan, CRT parts for TVs, car body parts, a flight of what we tentatively identify as Lockheed P-80 Shooting Stars, and a Patton tank. Perhaps for the Hackaday reader the interest increases though when we see the training of an apprentice toolmaker, a young man who is being trained to the highest standards in the use of machine tools. Its a complaint weve heard from some of our industry contacts that its rare now to find skills at this level, but wed be interested to hear views in the comments on the veracity of that claim, or whether in a world of CAD and CNC such a level of skill is still necessary. Either way were sure that the insistence on metrology would be just as familiar in a modern machine shop.\nA quick web search finds that the National Tool and Die Manufacturers Association no longer exists, instead the search engine recommends the National Tooling And Machining Association. Were not sure whether this is a successor organisation or a different one, but it definitely represents the same constituency. When the film was made, America was at the peak of its post-war boom, and the apprentice would no doubt have gone on to a successful and pretty lucrative career. We hope his present-day equivalent is as valued.\nIf youre of a mind for more industrial process, can we direct you at die casting?\n\n", "title": "1953\u5e74\u306e\u6620\u50cf\uff1a\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u6614\u306e\u5ba3\u4f1d\u6620\u753b\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306aHackaday\u3067\u306f\u30011953\u5e74\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u3067\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u304c\u5f37\u8abf\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u8077\u4eba\u306e\u8a13\u7df4\u3084\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u88fd\u54c1\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u6614\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3084\u8077\u4eba\u6280\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u304c\u518d\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u308b\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["1953\u5e74\u306e\u6620\u50cf\uff1a\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u6b8b\u308b\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5177\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u6280\u8853", "\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\uff1a\u6614\u3068\u4eca\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "CNC\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8077\u4eba\u6280\u8853\u306e\u4fa1\u5024", "\u7523\u696d\u7528\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\uff1a\u30c0\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0"]}

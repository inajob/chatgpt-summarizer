The answer: create a mod chip for a fridge.\nWhile the fridge electronics themselves couldnt be reached, there was full access to a daughterboard with the fridge controls. It should be easy enough to use them to turn off the alarm, but first a little reverse engineering was required. It used a serial communication with an old-school set of shift registers rather than a microcontroller, but it soon became apparent that the job could be done by simply pulling the buttons down. In a move that should gladden the heart of all Hackaday readers then, the modchip in question didnt even have to be a processor, instead it could be the venerable 555 timer. Our lives are complete, and the fridge is no longer annoying.\nThe 555 is unashamedly a Hackaday cliche, but even after five decades it still bears some understanding."}

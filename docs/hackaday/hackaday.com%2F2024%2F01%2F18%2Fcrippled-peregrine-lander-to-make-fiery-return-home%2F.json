But mission controllers felt the more responsible approach was to have Peregrine make a controlled re-entry while they still had the ability to maneuver it. The alternative, allowing the craft to remain in an uncontrolled orbit between the Earth and Moon, could potentially have caused problems for future Artemis missions.\nOver the last ten days, ground controllers at Astrobotic have been working to piece together what happened to the doomed lander, while at the same time demonstrating a remarkable level of transparency by keeping the public informed along the way. Its now believed that the stream of gas being expelled from a rupture in one of the crafts propellant tanks was acting as a sort of impromptu thruster. This not only made the craft difficult to keep oriented, but also wasted the propellants that were necessary to perform a soft landing on the lunar surface.\nAlthough the craft was eventually brought under control, the damage to the mission had already been done. While this obviously isnt the ending that Astrobotic was hoping for, we have no doubt that the company collected valuable data during the crafts flight through space, which took it approximately 390,000 kilometers (242,000 miles) from Earth.\nAs for us space nerds, we wont have to wait long before another lunar lander makes its attempt. Japans Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) should be touching down at around 10 AM Eastern on Friday (YouTube Live Stream), and the Nova-C lander from Intuitive Machines is scheduled to be launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket sometime next month.", "title": "\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u3001\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u570f\u3067\u6d88\u6ec5\u3078", "body": "\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u306f\u30011972\u5e74\u306e\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u8a08\u753b\u4ee5\u6765\u521d\u306e\u7c73\u56fd\u306e\u7740\u9678\u8239\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6708\u9762\u306b\u5230\u9054\u3059\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u5f8c\u6570\u6642\u9593\u3067\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u91cd\u5927\u306a\u6545\u969c\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u3001\u5730\u7403\u3068\u6708\u306e\u9593\u3092\u7121\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u56de\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8cac\u4efb\u3042\u308b\u63aa\u7f6e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u3001\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u570f\u3067\u6d88\u6ec5\u3078", "\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u3001\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u8a08\u753b\u7d42\u4e86\u4ee5\u6765\u521d\u306e\u7c73\u56fd\u7740\u9678\u6a5f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5931\u6557\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u308b", "\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u7740\u9678\u6a5f\u3001\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4e2d\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u91cd\u5927\u306a\u969c\u5bb3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u6c7a\u5b9a", "\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30da\u30ec\u30b0\u30ea\u30f3\u7740\u9678\u6a5f\u306e\u640d\u50b7\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b", "\u65e5\u672c\u306eSLIM\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u6708\u63a2\u67fb\u7740\u9678\u6a5f\u3068\u3057\u306610\u6642\u306b\u7740\u9678\u4e88\u5b9a"]}

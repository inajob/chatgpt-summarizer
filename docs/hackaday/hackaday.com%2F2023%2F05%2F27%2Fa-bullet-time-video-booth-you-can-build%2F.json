The bullet time video effect was introduced by the classic movie franchise and makes for a splendid video transition effect for video montages.\nHardware-wise, the effect is pretty expensive, requiring many cameras at various angles to be simultaneously triggered, in order to capture the subject in a fixed pose with a rotating camera. Essentially you need as many cameras as frames in the sequence, so even at 24 frames per second (FPS), thats a lot of hardware. [Sebastian] cheated a bit, and used a single front-facing camera for the bulk of the video recording, and twelve individual DSLRs covering approximately 90 degrees of rotation for the transition. More than that is likely impractical (not to mention rather expensive) for an automated setup used in as chaotic an environment as a wedding reception! So, the video effect is quite the same as in the movies, as this is a fixed pose, but it still looks pretty good.\nA Pico-W hidden in there providing a BT connected interface button\n[Sebastian] did consider going down the Raspberry Pi plus Pi-cam route, but once you add in a lens and the hassle of the casing and mounting hardware, not to mention availability and cost, snagging a pile of old DLSRs looks quite attractive. Connectivity to the camera is a simple 3.5 mm jack for the focus and trigger inputs, with frames read out via a USB connection.\nFor practical deployment, the camera batteries were replaced with battery eliminator adapters which step-up the 5 V from the USB connection to the 7.4 V the cameras need, but the current spike produced by the coordinated trigger of all twelve cameras overwhelmed any power supply available. The solution, to be practical, and not at all elegant, is to just have lots of power supplies hidden in a box. Sometimes youve just got a job to do.\nReproducing this at home might be a bit awkward unless you have exactly the same hardware to hand, but the principles are sound, and there are a few interesting details to dig into, if you were so inclined.\nWeve seen a few takes on the bullet-time effect over the years. We featured a Raspberry Pi-based hack, a couple of years back, and earlier still, someone even built a rig to take bullet-time videos of Tesla coil discharges, because why not?\n\n", "title": "\u7d50\u5a5a\u5f0f\u7528\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3001\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6620\u753b\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u72ec\u81ea\u306b\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305fDSLR\u30ab\u30e1\u30e912\u53f0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001USB\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067\u540c\u6642\u306b\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3001\u6620\u50cf\u306b\u7279\u6b8a\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u518d\u73fe\u306f\u5bb9\u6613\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u7d50\u5a5a\u5f0f\u7528\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "Matrix\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u5584\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "Bullet Time\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092DSLR\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3001\u5024\u6bb5\u3082\u5f35\u308bBullet Time\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u7248\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "Raspberry Pi\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bPico-W\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDSLR\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002"]}

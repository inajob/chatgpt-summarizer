However, you can still build sizable stuff with a smaller router if you know what youre doing. [Aribabox] shares some useful tricks and techniques for building large workshop cabinets on smaller machines.\nThe key to doing this well is modularity. [Aribabox] shows off how to build excellent workshop drawers in pieces using a stackable design. Rather than having to cut out one huge side panel to cover the whole stack of drawers, each drawer can have its own side panel that easily fits on a smaller router. They can then be stacked into a stout assembly that still does its job perfectly well. Assuming your CNC router is trued up properly, you can whip up a lot of furniture quickly, just assembling everything with screws.\u00a0 Youll still be able to work faster and make bigger things easier on a big machine, but a small machine can do a lot more than you think.\n[Aribabox] supplies design files for a cost if youre eager to replicate their work. If that doesnt suit you, you can always just use the video as inspiration to work on your own modular furniture designs instead.\u00a0Weve featured other modular furniture designs before, too, that rely on 3D printed and lasercut components.\n\n\n[Thanks to Hassi for the tip!}", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578bCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5bb6\u5177\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u79d8\u8a23", "body": "\u5c0f\u578bCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5bb6\u5177\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u5f0f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578bCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5bb6\u5177\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u79d8\u8a23", "- \u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u7c21\u5358DIY \u5927\u578b\u4f5c\u696d\u53f0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u5bb6\u5177\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u52a0\u901f\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u96c6", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u5bb6\u5177\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

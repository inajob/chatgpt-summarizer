A sad day for study of the red planet, but at the same time a chance to look back at what has been a long and successful mission.\nIn the hacks of the week, we have a lo-fi camera, a very refined Commodore 64 laptop, and a MIDI slapophone to entertain you, as well as taking a detailed look at neutrino detectors. Then CYMK printing with laser cut stencils draws our attention, as well as the arrival of stable GPIB support for Linux. Finally both staffers let loose; Elliot with an epic rant about spreadsheets, and Jenny enthusiastically describing the Haiku operating system.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in the comments!\n\nIts dangerous to go alone.

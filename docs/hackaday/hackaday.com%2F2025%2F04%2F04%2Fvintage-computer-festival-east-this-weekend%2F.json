After all, [Brian Kernighan] is going to be there. Yes, that [Brian Kernighan].\nEvents are actually well underway, and you\u2019ve already missed the first few TRS-80 Color Computer programming workshops, but rest assured that they\u2019re going on all weekend. If you\u2019re from the other side of the retrocomputing fence, namely the C64 side, you\u2019ve also got a lot to look forward to, because the theme this year is \u201cThe Sounds of Retro\u201d which means that your favorite chiptune chips will be getting a workout.\n[Tom Nardi] went to VCF East last year, so if you\u2019re on the fence, just have a look at his writeup and you\u2019ll probably hop in your car, or like us, wish you could. If when you do end up going, let us know how it was in the comments!", "title": "- \u300c\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u6771\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30cf\u30f3\u304c\u53c2\u52a0\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u7c73\u56fd\u6771\u6d77\u5cb8\u306e\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ebNJ\u3067\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u304c\u958b\u50ac\u4e2d\u3002\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u6c42\u3080\uff01", "titles": ["- \u300c\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u6771\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30cf\u30f3\u304c\u53c2\u52a0\uff01\u300d", "- \u300c\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff1aVCF East 2023\u300d", "- \u300c\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306e\u97f3\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cTRS-80\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u958b\u50ac\u4e2d\uff01\u300d", "- \u300cVCF East\u306e\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff1a\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u306e\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u3057\u3088\u3046\u300d"]}

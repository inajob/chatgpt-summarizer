At the RAPID + TCT 2024 tradeshow it seems that we got two more new AM approaches to keep an eye on to see how they develop. These are powder-based Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) by Grid Logic and centrifugal 3D printing by Fugo Precision.\nGrid Logic demo at RAPID + TCT 2024. (Credit: Ian Wright)\nGrid Logics HIP uses binder-less powders in sealed containers that are compressed and deposited into a HIP can according to the design being printed, followed by the HIP process. This is a common post-processing step outside of AM as well, but here HIP is used as the primary method in what seems like a budget version of typical powder sintering AM printers. Doubtlessly it wont be hobbyist cheap, but it promises to allow for printing ceramic and metal parts with minimal wasted powder, which is a major concern with current powder-based sintering printers.\nWhile Grid Logics approach is relatively conservative, Fugos Model A printer using centrifugal printing is definitely trying to distinguish itself. It uses 20 lasers which are claimed to achieve 30 \u00b5m accuracy in all directions with a speed of 1 mm/minute. It competes with SLA printers, which also means that it works with photopolymers, but rather than messing with FEP film and pesky Earth gravity, it uses a spinning drum to create its own gravitational parameters, along with a built-in parts cleaning and curing system. They claim that this method requires 50% fewer supports while printing much faster than competing commercial SLA printers.\nEven if not immediately relevant to AM enthusiasts, its good to see new ideas being tried in the hope that they will make AM better for all of us.", "title": "\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u3068\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5370\u5237\uff1aGrid Logic\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044POWDER-BASED HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING\uff08HIP\uff09\u6280\u8853  ", "body": "RAPID + TCT 2024\u306b\u3066\u3001Grid Logic\u306eHIP\u3068Fugo Precision\u306e\u9060\u5fc3\u5f0f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u3044\u3046\u65b0\u3057\u3044AM\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002HIP\u306f\u73fe\u884c\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001Fugo\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u304b\u3064\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002AM\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u3068\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5370\u5237\uff1aGrid Logic\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044POWDER-BASED HOT ISOSTATIC PRESSING\uff08HIP\uff09\u6280\u8853  ", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1aFugo Precision\u306e\u9060\u5fc3\u529b3D\u5370\u5237  ", "RAPID + TCT 2024\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u7d39\u4ecb\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8  ", "Fugo Precision\u306eModel A\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u7cbe\u5ea630 \u00b5m\u306eSLA\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u6311\u6226  ", "AM\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u5370\u5237\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u5c55\u958b"]}

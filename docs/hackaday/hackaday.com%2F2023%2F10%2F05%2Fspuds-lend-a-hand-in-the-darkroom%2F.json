Theres a new one to us though, from [cm.kelsall], who has put the tater in the darkroom, by making a working developer with potatoes as the active ingredient.\nThe recipe follows a fairly standard one, with the plant extract joined by some washing soda and vitamin C. The spuds are liquidised and something of a watery smoothie produced, which is filtered and diluted for the final product. Its evidently not the strongest of developers though, because at 20 Celcius its left for two hours to gain an acceptable result.\nThe chemistry behind these developers usually comes from naturally occurring phenols in the plant, with the effectiveness varying with their concentration. Theyre supposed to be better for the environment than synthetic developers, but sadly those credentails are let down somewhat by there not being a similar green replacement for the fixer, and the matter of a load of silver ions in the resulting solutions. Still, its interesting to know that spuds could be used this way, and its something we might even try ourselves one day.\nWeve even had a look at the coffee process before.", "title": "\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u3067\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\uff01\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u73fe\u50cf\u6db2\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u3084\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb\u3001\u91ce\u83dc\u30a8\u30ad\u30b9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\u306e\u8a71\u306f\u3088\u304f\u805e\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3058\u3083\u304c\u3044\u3082\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u73fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3001\u3058\u3083\u304c\u3044\u3082\u30a8\u30ad\u30b9\u306b\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30bd\u30fc\u30c0\u3068\u30d3\u30bf\u30df\u30f3C\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u304c\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3084\u3084\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u3067\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\uff01\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u73fe\u50cf\u6db2\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u91ce\u83dc\u306e\u529b\u3092\u501f\u308a\u305f\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\u6cd5\uff1a\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30d9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc", "\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u3067\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u73fe\u50cf\u6db2\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f\uff1a\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u3001\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30d9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc", "\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u73fe\u50cf\u6db2\u306e\u30ec\u30b7\u30d4\uff1a\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u308d\u3046"]}

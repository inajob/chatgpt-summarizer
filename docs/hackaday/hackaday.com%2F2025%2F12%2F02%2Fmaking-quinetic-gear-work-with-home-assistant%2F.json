Some might not be compatible with the wiring in your house, while others are battery powered and need attention on the regular. [Willow Herring] came across some nice self-powered versions that were nonetheless locked to a proprietary hub. Reverse engineering ensued!\n[Willow] was using a range of smart home products from Quinetic, including the aforementioned self-powered switches. However, she couldnt stand using them with the Quinetic hub, which was required to get them functioning with the brands relays and in-line switch relays. It all came down to the buggy smartphone app that was supposed to lace everything together, but never worked quite right. Instead, she set about deciphering the language the switches speak so they could be paired with other smarthome systems.\n[Cameron Gray] had done some work in this area, which proved a useful starting point, though it didnt enable the use of the switches with the various types of Quinetic relays. [Willow] decided to try and learn more about the system, starting with a CC1101 radio module hooked up to a ESP8266. Some tinkering around with expected message lengths started bearing fruit, and soon enough the format of the messages became clear.\nBefore long, [Willow] had figured out how to get the whole system talking to MQTT and Home Assistant, without compromising their ability to operate independently. Code is on Github for those eager to tinker further.\nWeve looked at a number of self-powered switches before, too. If youve found your own neat way of interfacing these devices, dont hesitate to notify the tipsline!\n[Thanks to Jess for the tip!]"}

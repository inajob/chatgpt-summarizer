Since its release, many other similar products have hit the market. Among them is the Ulanzi D200 U-Studio, which is proving popular with hackers for good reason.\n[Rodrigo Laneth] has been digging into the D200, and found out its running Linux 5.10.160 on a quad-core Rockchip RK3308HS chip. Notably, he determined the kernel appears to be from Android, but that Ulanzi removed the Android userspace and slapped Buildroot on top, in his own words. Interesting, if not that unusual. What\u00a0is key, however, is that the device has a fully open adb root shell, as noted by [lucasteske], which inspired [Rodrigo]s investigation. This pretty much allows full access to the device, so you can make it do whatever weird thing your heart desires.\nAs you might expect, people are already making the D200 do fun stuff. [lucasteske] got it running DOOM in short order. Meanwhile, [Rodrigo] has it playing out Bad Apple!! at 30 FPS, with code and a deeper explanation available on GitHub.\nIts rare these days that manufacturers leave root open on any commercial device. You normally need to pull a few tricks to get that kind of access.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Lucas Teske (@racerxdl)\n\n\n", "title": "- Ulanzi D200 U-Studio: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "body": "Ulanzi D200 U-Studio\u306fLinux\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306aadb root\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- Ulanzi D200 U-Studio: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- Linux\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fUlanzi D200\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff01D200\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- DOOM\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\uff01Ulanzi D200\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u5546\u696d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u3055\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

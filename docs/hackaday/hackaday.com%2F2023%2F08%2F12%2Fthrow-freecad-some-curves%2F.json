We have to admit that when we saw it, we knew it would be hard to model well. Naturally, there are several ways it could be one, but [Mango Jelly] used the curves workbench in FreeCAD to produce a wireframe of the shape, and you can see how that works in the video below.\nThe curve bench didnt sound familiar to us, and thats because it is an add-on workbench. He starts with a sketch of a curve, constrained to be symmetrical. Then the draft workbench allowed a rotation to convert the curve into a nice skeleton of the curved roof.\nThe curves workbench can create a Gordon surface over that skeleton. You can extrude that into a solid object. There are still some details to add, though, and youll see how each part of the roof takes shape.\nWatching videos like this reminds us that we use a small fraction of what FreeCAD can do. Youll probably pick up at least one tip from this video. If you need a quick basic tutorial, try the one from [NovaSpirit]. Or, try a longer one.\n\n"}

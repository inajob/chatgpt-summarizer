Its quick, and easy, but because of how little force required to part it, not terribly reliable. This is why electrical connectors from terminal blocks to crimp connectors and everything else in between exist, to make a more robust join.\nBut what if there was a way to make your twist connections stronger? [Ibanis Sorenzo] may have the answer, in the form of an ingenious 3D printed clamp system to hold everything in place. Its claimed to result in a join stronger than the wire itself.\nThe operation is simple enough, a spring clamp encloses the join, and a threaded outer piece screws over it to clamp it all together. Theres a pair of 3D printable tools to aid assembly, and a range of different sizes to fit different wires. It looks well-thought-out and practical, so perhaps it could be a useful tool in your armoury. We can see in particular that for those moments when you dont have the right connectors to hand, a quick 3D print could save the say.\nA few years ago we evaluated a set of different ways to make crimp connections. It would be interesting to subject this connection to a similar test. Meanwhile you can see a comprehensive description in the video below the break.\n\n\nThanks [George Graves] for the tip.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u96fb\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2 ", "body": "\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u96fb\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2 ", "\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2 ", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u96fb\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3001\u5f37\u56fa\u306a\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5 ", "\u3059\u3050\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u5f37\u5316\u6cd5"]}

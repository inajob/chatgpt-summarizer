But perhaps fewer will have worked with CRTs themselves as components, and of those, fewer still will be familiar with the earlier generation of tubes. In the first few decades of color TV the tubes were so-called delta gun because their three electron guns were arranged in a triangular form. [Colorvac] has put up a video in which they demonstrate the reconditioning of one of these tubes from a late-1960s Nordmende TV.\nThe tube in question isnt one of the earlier roundies you would find on an American color TV from the 50s or early 60s, instead its one of the first generation of rectangular (ish) screens. Its got an under-performing blue gun, so theyre replacing the electron gun assembly. Cutting the neck of the tube, bonding a new neck extension, and sealing in a new gun assembly is not for the faint-hearted, and its clear they have both the specialist machinery and the experience required for the job. Finally we see the reconditioned tube put back into the chassis, and are treated to a demonstration of converging the three beams.\nFor those of us who cut our teeth on these devices, its fascinating.\n\n", "title": "- \u300cCRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf\u30ac\u30f3\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u300d", "body": "CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u518d\u751f\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u9283\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u5de5\u7a0b\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300cCRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf\u30ac\u30f3\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u300d", "- \u300c1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eCRT\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u9283\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff1aCRT\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u300d", "- \u300c\u5c02\u9580\u6280\u8853\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305fCRT\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u518d\u751f\u8853\u300d", "- \u300c\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u6280\u8853\u300d"]}

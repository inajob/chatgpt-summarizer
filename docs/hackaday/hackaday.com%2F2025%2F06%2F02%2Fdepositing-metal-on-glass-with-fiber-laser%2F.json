Etching the foil blasts off enough metal to deposit a thin film of it onto the glass.\u00a0 From electron microscopy, [Breaking Taps] reveals that whats happening is that microscopic molten metal droplets are splashing up to the metal, rather than this being any kind of plasma process like sputtering. He found this technique worked best with silver of all the materials tested, and there were a few. While copper worked, it was not terribly conductive  he suggests electroplating a thicker layer onto the (probably rather oxidized) copper before trying to solder, but demonstrates soldering to it regardless, which seems to work.\u00a0\nThis might be a neat way to make artistic glass-substrate PCBs. More testing will be needed to see if this would be worth the effort over just gluing copper foil to glass, as has been done before. [Breaking Taps] suspects, and we agree, that his process would work better under an inert atmosphere, and we\u2019d like to see it tried.\nOne thing to note is that, regardless of atmosphere, alloys are a bit iffy with this technique, as the blast little drops off process can cause them to demix on the glass surface. He also reasons that printing a large area of metal onto the glass, and then etching it off would be a more reliable technique than trying to deposit complex patterns directly to the glass in one go. Either way, though, its worth a try if you have a fiber laser.\u00a0\nDont have a fiber laser? Maybe you could build one.\u00a0\n\n"}

If could  and probably does  mean that everything is hunky dory on land, and theres no need to pull the trigger. Or, could radio silence mean that the party already kicked off, and theres nobody left to give the order to retaliate? What do you do then?\nOne popular rumor  or rumour, given the context  in the UK holds that BBC Radio 4, or the lack thereof, is sort of a deadmans switch for the Royal Navys ballistic missile subs. [Lewis (M3HHY)], aka Ringway Manchester\u00a0on YouTube, addresses this in the video below, and spoiler alert: its probably not true.\n\nThe theory goes that if all other means of communication fail  an unlikely eventuality given the level of redundancy and the sheer number of sensors a ballistic missile sub has at its disposal  monitoring the airwaves for the BBC Radio 4 Today program should give a sub commander a clear indication of how things are going on the beach, as it were. Today\u00a0has been running continuously since October 1957  the same month Sputnik was launched; coincidence? The absence of the show from the airwaves would be a clear indication that things had gone terribly wrong, and that the submarine commander would be free to use his judgment regarding the disposition of the weapons under his control.\nOn the surface, it sounds like a good plan, but a moments thought puts the lie to it. How would a commander distinguish between the end of the world as we know it and a more mundane event, like a storm or a power failure? Or even the failure of some of the boats radio gear, or just poor propagation (the specific Radio 4 signal was supposed to emanate from Droitwich on 198 kHz in the longwave band). Kicking off World War III under those circumstances, which is basically the equivalent of a US sub coming to periscope depth to visually assess the Waffle House Index, would probably be considered bad form, at the least.\nStill, wed imagine that monitoring civilian broadcasts is just one of the many tools at a boomer skippers disposal, and contributes mightily to the overall situational awareness picture. There are also a lot of other interesting tidbits in the video, especially the letters of last resort.\n"}

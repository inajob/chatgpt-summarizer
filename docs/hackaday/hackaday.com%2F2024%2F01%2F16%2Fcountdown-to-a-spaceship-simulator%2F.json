But no matter what generation ends up getting the most enjoyment out of it, theres no question its an impressive build so far, complete with a very realistic-looking instrument display and joystick.\nThis is only the first in a series of builds, but our inner child is already intensely jealous. So far, [Jon] has built the instrument panel and controller that lights all buttons and runs the displays, which shows telemetry from a Falcon 9 launch. The video below goes into a lot of detail about how he built this SPI-driven instrument panel and why he made the whole thing modular, so it can be easily expanded without turning into a spaghetti-like mess.\nIts a great intro to thinking before you build, showing how he planned and built the system for maximum expandability and flexibility. Before the end, we wouldnt surprised if hes got quite a Kerbal Space Program controller on his hands for when the kid goes to bed.\n\n"}

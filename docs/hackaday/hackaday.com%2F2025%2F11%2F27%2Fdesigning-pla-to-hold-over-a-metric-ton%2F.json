This is something that [Tom Stanton] from Tim Stanton (wait, what now), [Tom]\u2019s 2nd channel, took to heart for Polymaker\u2019s 3D design challenge. The goal was simple: a single 3D printed part to hold as much weight as possible.\nWhile seemingly simple, when considering the requirements, including a single print in addition to being able to open up for the mounts, the challenge gets exponentially more complicated. While the simplest and strongest joint would be a simple oval for uniform stress, this isn\u2019t possible when considering the opening requirements. This creates a need for slightly more creativity.\n[Tom] starts out with two flat C-shaped geometries to test his design. The design includes teeth specially placed to allow the forces to increase their own strength as force is applied. Flat features have the unfortunate quality of being able to slide across each other rather easily, which was the case during testing; however, the actual structures held up rather well. Moving onto the final design, including a hollow cavity and a much thicker depth, showed good promise early on in the competition, leading up to the finals. In fact, the design won out over anything else, getting over double the max strength of the runner up. Over an entire metric ton, the piece of plastic proved its abilities far past anything us here at Hackaday would expect from a small piece of PLA.\nDesign can be an absolute rabbit hole when it comes to even the simplest of things, as shown with this competition. [Tom] clearly showed some personal passion for this project; however, if you haven\u2019t had the chance to dive this deep into CADing, keep sure to try out something like TinkerCAD to get your feet wet. TinkerCAD started out simple as can be but has exploded into quite the formidable suite!\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u7af6\u6280\u7528\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u91cd\u3055\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "Tom Stanton\u306f3D\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30da\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u3002\u72ec\u81ea\u306eC\u5b57\u578b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u512a\u52dd\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u7af6\u6280\u7528\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u91cd\u3055\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u9769\u65b0\u7684\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1aC\u578b\u30b8\u30aa\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u5f37\u5ea6", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30b3\u30f3\u30da\u30c6\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u52dd\u5229", "- TinkerCAD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- PLA\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a1\u30c8\u30f3\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u8010\u8377\u91cd\u306e\u5b9f\u7e3e"]}

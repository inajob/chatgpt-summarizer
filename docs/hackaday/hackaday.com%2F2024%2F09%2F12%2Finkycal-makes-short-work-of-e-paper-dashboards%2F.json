Use it to show your daily schedule, the news, weather, maybe the latest posts from your favorite hardware hacking website. Any information source that doesnt need to be updated more than every hour or so is a perfect candidate. All youve got to do is write the necessary code to pull\u00a0 down said data and turn it into a visually attractive display.\nWell, that last part isnt always so easy. There are plenty of folks who have no problem cobbling together a Raspberry Pi and one of the commercially available e-paper modules, but writing the software to turn it into a useful information center is another story entirely. Luckily, Inkycal is here to help.\nThis open source project uses Python to pull information from a wide variety of sources and turns it into an e-paper friendly dashboard. It works with Waveshare displays ranging from 4.2 inches all the way up to the massive 12 inch tricolor panels. While it could theoretically be deployed on any operating system running a modern version of Python, its primarily developed to be run under Linux and on the Raspberry Pi. All of the versions of the Pi are supported, so no need to spring for the latest and greatest model. In fact, the notoriously pokey Raspberry Pi Zero is their recommended platform thanks to its low power consumption.\nWith Inkycal on the Pi  they even provide a pre-configured SD card image  and the e-paper display hooked up, all you need to do is pick which sources you want to use from the web-based configuration page. Look ma, no code!\nNot feeling like putting the hardware together either? Well, we might wonder how youve found yourself on Hackaday if thats the case. But if you really would rather buy then build, you can get a pre-built Inkcal display right now on Tindie."}

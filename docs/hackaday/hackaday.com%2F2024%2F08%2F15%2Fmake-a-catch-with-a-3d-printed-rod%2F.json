Angling is a pursuit with a heritage, and having a lengthy rod seems an essential for its enjoyment. But perhaps your tackle neednt be such an important factor, and in that spirit heres [3dcreation] with a tiny but fully functional 3D printed fishing rod.\nIf youve ever seen a fisherman working through a hole in the ice, you may have some idea of the type of rod in question, its a stubby affair half handle and half rod, with a rudimentary reel in the middle. In the pictures its loaded up with line, weight ready to go, so we can see how its supposed to work. Were not anglers here though, so the question of whether it would indeed work is one for your imagination.\nPerhaps surprisingly, few anglers find their way onto these pages.

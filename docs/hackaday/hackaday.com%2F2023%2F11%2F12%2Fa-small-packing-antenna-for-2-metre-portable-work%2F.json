Often this means using the HF or shortwave bands, but the higher frequencies get a look-in as well. A smaller antenna is no less the challenge when it comes to designing one that can be carried though, and [Thomas Witherspoon] demonstrates this with a foldable loop antenna for the 2 metre band.\nThe antenna provides a reminder that the higher bands are nothing to be scared of in construction terms, it uses a BNC-to-4 mm socket adapter as its feedpoint, and makes the rectangular shape of the loop with pieces of fiberglass tube. The wire itself is flexible antenna wire, though were guessing almost any conductor could be used. The result is a basic but useful antenna that certainly packs down to a very small size, and we can see it would be a useful addition to any portable operators arsenal.\nIf youre a 2 metre band user, this certainly isnt the first time weve visited lightweight antennas for this band.", "title": "2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "body": "2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u306b\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3067\u3082\u6709\u52b9\u3067\u3001\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3067\u3082\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u30ab\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u306b\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3079\u308b2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u306e\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u306e2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

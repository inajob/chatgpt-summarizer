Not that we\u2019re complaining, of course. Especially when they get picked up for projects like this Retro CRT Weather Display from [Conrad Farnsworth], which recreates the interface of The Weather Channel\u2019s WeatherStar 4000+ in a suitably 90s-styled format.The CRT itself takes up most of the space in the enclosure, with the control electronics situated in the base behind the display driver. A Raspberry Pi Zero W provides the necessary processing power, and connects to the CRT through its composite video output.\nA custom PCB plugs into the GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi and provides some additional features, such as a rotary encoder for volume and brightness display, a control button, a serial UART interface, and a speaker driver. The design still has one or two caveats: it\u2019s designed to powered by USB, but [Conrad] notes that it draws more current than USB 2.0 can provide, though USB-C should be able to keep up.On the software side, a Python program displays a cycle of three slides: local weather, regional weather, and a radar display. For the local and regional weather display graphics, [Conrad] created a static background image containing most of the graphics, and the program only generated the dynamic components. For the radar display, the regional map\u2019s outlines come from Natural Earth, and a Python program overlays radar data on them.\nWeve seen other attempts at recreating the unique style of the WeatherStar system, but nothing quite beats the real thing.\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aCRT\u5929\u6c17\u8868\u793a\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u53e4\u3044CRT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f90\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u8868\u793a\u5668\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aCRT\u5929\u6c17\u8868\u793a\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f90\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "- CRT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bThe Weather Channel\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "- Python\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u5929\u6c17\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u8868\u793a", "- USB\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

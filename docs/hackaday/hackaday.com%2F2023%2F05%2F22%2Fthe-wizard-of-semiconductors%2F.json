Youll also need the SiliWiz software (or use it online), which resembles the kind of tools that chip designers use but is meant for students to use as a learning tool\nUsing SiliWiz, you create layers on a virtual device, and you can use Spice to view the results. The tutorial is meant to be high-level and is suggested for students aged 14 or over (but we liked it and we are quite a bit older than that). Some more advanced material is also available at the same site.\n\nSiliWiz is easy to use. You build layers of n or p material, metal, or polysilicon. A slider lets you show a cross-section at a particular point. You label metal endpoints and use the simulation to plot the results. As expected, the process mimics a simplified version of the open-source Skywater process design kit.\nWeve had experience designing and doing failure analysis on ICs, and it is truly a different world. For example, resistors created with diffusion or polysilicon are typically difficult to make precise (thats why you see laser-trimmed resistors on expensive precision components). However, because photolithography is very precise, the ratio of two capacitors can be a very dependable value even if the absolute value of each capacitor is less predictable. So for a digital-to-analog converter, for example, on a PCB you might use resistors, while on an IC, you are more likely to use capacitors where the ratio of values is well-known. Getting that kind of precision on a PCB with discrete capacitors would be tough.\nDesigning chips is not easy, and you usually want to start at a higher level and then translate your idea into silicon. SiliWiz isnt going to give you a directly buildable design, but it will help you understand the IC design and fabrication process better.\nWeve covered the Skywater PDK before. We highly suggest you check out [Matt Venns] Zero to ASIC workshop if you plan to take this further."}

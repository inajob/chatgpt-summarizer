Intuitively, it seems like youd need some complicated physics setup with lasers and maybe some liquid helium. But as it turns out, all you need is some simple lab glassware and a heat gun. And a laser, of course.\nTo be clear, the method that\u00a0[Markus Bindhammer] describes in the video below is only an estimation of absolute zero via Charless Law, which describes how gases expand when heated. To gather the needed data, [Marb] used a 50-ml glass syringe mounted horizontally on a stand and fitted with a thermocouple. Across from the plunger of the syringe he placed a VL6180 laser time-of-flight sensor, to measure the displacement of the plunger as the air within it expands.\nData from the TOF sensor and the thermocouple were recorded by a microcontroller as the air inside the syringe was gently heated. Plotting the volume of the gas versus the temperature results shows a nicely linear relationship, and the linear regression can be used to calculate the temperature at which the volume of the gas would be zero. The result: -268.82\u00b0C, or only about four degrees off from the accepted value of -273.15\u00b0. Not too shabby.\n[Marb] has been on a tear lately with science projects like these; check out his open-source blood glucose measurement method or his all-in-one electrochemistry lab.\n\n", "title": "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u7d76\u5bfe\u96f6\u5ea6\u3092\u63a8\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u7d76\u5bfe\u96f6\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u5668\u5177\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u3068\u4f53\u7a4d\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u304b\u3089\u63a8\u5b9a\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u306f-268.82\u00b0C\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u7d76\u5bfe\u96f6\u5ea6\u3092\u63a8\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u30b7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b8\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u7d76\u5bfe\u96f6\u5ea6", "\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30eb\u306e\u6cd5\u5247\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6e29\u5ea6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7269\u7406\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6c17\u4f53\u306e\u4f53\u7a4d\u3068\u6e29\u5ea6\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u89e3\u6790"]}

It does this by first generating a tetrahedral mesh of the model and then calculating the shortest possible path through the model from any given tetrahedron to the print bed. Even with non-planar printing, you need to print from the print-bed up (or out).\nQuite a lot of math is done to use these paths to calculate a deformation mesh, and well leave that to [Joshua] to explain in his video below. After applying the deformation, he slices the resulting mesh in Cura, before the G-code goes back to Jupyter to be re-transformed, restoring the shape of the original mesh.\n to generate deformed models for slicing, like this.\nSo yes, it is G-code bending as others have demonstrated before, but in a reproducible, streamlined, and straightforward workflow. Indeed, [Josh] credits much of the work to earlier work on the S^3-Slicer, which inspired much of the logic and the name behind his S4 slicer. (Not S4 as in more than S^3 but S4 as a contraction of Simplified S^3). Once again, open source allows for incremental innovation.\nIt is admittedly a computationally intensive process, and [Joshua] uses a simplified model of Benchy for this demo. This seems exactly the sort of thing wed like to burn compute power on, though.\nThis sort of non-planar 3D printing is an exciting frontier, one which we have covered before. Weve seen techniques for non-planar infill, or even to print overhangs on unmodified Cartesian printers,\u00a0 but this is probably the first time weve seen Benchy given the non-planar treatment. You can try S4 slicer for yourself via GitHub, or just watch the non-planar magic in action after the break.\n\n"}

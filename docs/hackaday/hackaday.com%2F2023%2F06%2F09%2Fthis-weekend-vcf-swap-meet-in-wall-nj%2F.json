But with the rise of websites like Craigslist and eBay, meeting up in person to buy and sell used hardware started to fall out of style. The fact that the prices had to go up due to the considerable cost of shipping such large and heavy objects was an unfortunate side-effect, but it wasnt enough to stem the tide.\nIts unlikely that well ever truly return to those early days. But if youre within driving distance of Wall, New Jersey, you can take a step back in time on Saturday and experience a proper swap meet in all its glory. Hosted by the Vintage Computer Federation, the modest $5 entry fee goes to help support their worthy goal of preserving vintage computing history. After the swap meet officially wraps up at 2 PM, a short walk will take you over to their permanent exhibit located within the sprawling InfoAge Science and History Museum.\n\nI was able to visit the inaugural VCF Swap Meet back in 2021, and came away with a sense that this event had a bright future. At the time, the idea of holding an old school outdoor swap meet was born out of necessity  New Jerseys relatively strict limitations on indoor gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic made anything else largely untenable. But the response was so great that the VCF wisely decided to keep it going in post-pandemic times, and the event has only grown since then.\nThis year, due to popular demand, the Swap Meet will feature food and drinks for purchase thanks to the South Monmouth Fire Museum  another worthy cause thats currently working to establish their own presence within the InfoAge campus.\nWhether youre in the market for some vintage gear, want to support a good cause, or wish to explore the wide array of tech and history exhibits located within the former Camp Evans base, this is the perfect weekend to take a drive out and experience everything this unique little niche in the Jersey Shore has to offer.\n", "title": "\u300c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b9\u30ef\u30c3\u30d7\u30df\u30fc\u30c8\u300d", "body": "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308bVintage Computer Federation\u4e3b\u50ac\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30df\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001VCF Swap Meet\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002$5\u306e\u5165\u5834\u6599\u306f\u3001\u6b74\u53f2\u4fdd\u5b58\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5bc4\u4ed8\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001InfoAge Science and History Museum\u3067\u5e38\u8a2d\u5c55\u793a\u3082\u89b3\u89a7\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8fd1\u304f\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u65b9\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30b9\u30ef\u30c3\u30d7\u30df\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u98a8\u666f\u304c\u4f53\u9a13\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b9\u30ef\u30c3\u30d7\u30df\u30fc\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30c7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08VCF\uff09\u4e3b\u50ac\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u8ca9\u58f2\u76ee\u7684\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4fdd\u5b58\u3092\u4e3b\u306a\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u3059\u308b\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30a2\u306e\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5b58\u5728\u3092\u77e5\u308c\u308b\u7d76\u597d\u306e\u6a5f\u4f1a\u300d", "\u300c\u5357\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u6d88\u9632\u535a\u7269\u9928\u3092\u5354\u529b\u3057\u305f\u3001\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\uff06\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u300d"]}

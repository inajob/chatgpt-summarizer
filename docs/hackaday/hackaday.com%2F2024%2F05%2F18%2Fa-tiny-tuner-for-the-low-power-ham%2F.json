If youd like to make sure all that power is transferred from your transmitter into the antenna and not reflected back into your power amplifier, theres a need for the impedance of the one to match that of the other. Most antennas arent quite the desired 50 ohms impedance, so part of the standard equipment becomes an antenna tuner  an impedance matching network. For high-power hams these are big boxes full of chunky variable capacitors and big air cored inductors, but that doesnt exclude the low-power ham from the impedance matching party. [Barbaros A\u015furo\u011flu WB2CBA] has designed the perfect device for them: the credit card ATU.\nThe circuit of an antenna tuner is simple enough, two capacitors and an inductor in a so-called Pi-network because of its superficial resemblance to the Greek letter Pi. The idea is to vary the capacitances and inductance to find the best match, and on this tiny model its done through a set of miniature rotary switches. There are a set of slide switches to vary the configuration or switch in a load, and theres even a simple matching indicator circuit.\nWe like this project, in that it elegantly provides an extremely useful piece of equipment, all integrated into a tiny footprint. Its certainly not the first ATU weve brought you.\nThanks [ftg] for the tip!", "title": "\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9ATU\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5bb6\u304c\u76f4\u9762\u3059\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u6574\u5408\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3078\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u4f1d\u9054\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8a18\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u8005\u306f\u300ccredit card ATU\u300d\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9ATU\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068ATU\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "\u643a\u5e2f\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306eATU\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3"]}

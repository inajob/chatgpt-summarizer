[ND-3D] has a different idea: printing with PEEK. You can get the details over on Hackaday.io, and there are a few YouTube videos below. Using a special controller and a halogen lamp, you can modify your own printer to use this exotic material often found in printer hot ends.\nLogically, if PEEK is used near the hot end of regular printers, it must need a higher temperature to print. PEEK has a glass transition temperature of about 143C and melts at 343. Compare this to PLA, which melts between 150 and 180 and has a glass transition temperature of only 60C.\n\nThe cost is reportedly under \u00a3200. Contrary to common wisdom, [ND-3D] suggests using an open frame for the printer. You do need precise control of the halogen light. A custom board handles that. The halogen heater wraps around a conventional hot end. Looks like it would keep your shop pretty toasty on a cold morning.\nWe were looking for more build details, and we hope they are forthcoming. It appears you can buy the boards, but wed like more information on what makes them different. It isnt clear to us that it isnt just control of AC power and a heater, but there isnt much information about what you have to do differently to work in PEEK or other exotic materials.\nWeve seen other high-temperature printers, of course. Not to mention, there is no shortage of high-end commercial offerings.\n\n"}

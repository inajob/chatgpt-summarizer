[Handy Bear] built a super simple example using some parts from IKEA.\nThe build starts with a Snudda, which is IKEAs version of a Lazy Susan. Its fitted with a 3D-printed gear to allow it to be easily driven. The platter is then fitted to a 3D printed base, which also contains the drive electronics, and driven by a small brushed DC gear motor. An off-the-shelf speed controller was employed to allow the speed of the platter to be varied as required.\n[Handy Bear] does a good job of explaining how to build the project properly while avoiding the usual pitfalls. In particular, he demonstrates how to fit the gear to the platter without getting it off-axis. We also appreciate a design that can be built virtually anywhere thanks to using commonly-available parts.\nWeve featured other rotating tables before, like this open-ended design that was built on a much larger scale. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Peeter for the tip!]"}

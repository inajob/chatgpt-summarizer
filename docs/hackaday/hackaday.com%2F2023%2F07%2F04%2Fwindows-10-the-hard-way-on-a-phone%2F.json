But [neozed] wanted something different. An earlier project ran Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 4 with some tricks, but those are sometimes hard to come by lately, so the next project was to put one on a Xiaomi PocoPhone F1.\nThe choice of phone wasnt an accident. There was enough support and information on the Snapdragon 845 to pull the trick off, and this is one of the phones that looked like it should work. They were pretty inexpensive on eBay and have 128 GB of flash and 6 GB of RAM.\nAfter a few false starts, the phone yielded to fastboot mode. Loading UEFI firmware allows you to re-partition the disks using a PC. With the partitions set up, you must find an ARM Windows 10 image to load. Sounds simple, but as youll see in the post, the devil is always in the details. Combined with a USB dock, the end result is a tiny Windows computer. However, it does seem like a lot of work. Even the original poster says: TL;DR dont do it get a used Surface X instead.\nWeve seen old phones repurposed before, of course. Or, go the other way: start from scratch and build a new phone. We wont judge, either way.", "title": "Raspberry Pi 4\u3067Windows 10\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Windows 10\u3092Xiaomi PocoPhone F1\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002Snapdragon 845\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u624b\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5143\u306e\u6295\u7a3f\u8005\u306f\u624b\u9593\u306e\u5272\u306b\u306f\u8cb7\u3044\u7269\u3092\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u306d\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi 4\u3067Windows 10\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Xiaomi PocoPhone F1\u306bWindows\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u3044\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5c0f\u3055\u306aWindows\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "ARM\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eWindows 10\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eWindows\u642d\u8f09\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

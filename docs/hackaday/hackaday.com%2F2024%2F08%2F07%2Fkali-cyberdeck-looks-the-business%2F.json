Thats especially true when fate hands you an enclosure as perfect as the one that inspired this very compact Kali Linux cyberdeck.\nNow, thats not to say that we dont love larger cyberdecks, of course. The ones built into Pelican-style shipping containers are particularly attractive, and its hard to argue against their practicality. But when [Hans J\u00f8rgen Grimstad], who somehow just sounds like a person who should be building cyberdecks, found a new-old-stock stash of US Army Signal Corps spare parts kits from the 1950s, designation CY-684/GR, he just had to spring into action. After carefully gutting the metal case of the dividers that once protected tubes and other parts, he had some PCB panels made up for the top and bottom. The bottom had enough room for a compact USB keypad, with room left over on the panel for a cooling fan and various connectors. A 7 HDMI display was added to the panel on the top lid, while a Raspberry Pi 5 with a 500-GB NVMe SSD went below the lower panel. The insides are properly decorated with cyberpunk-esque regalia including a Self Destruct button. Sadly, this appears to be unimplemented in the current version, at least for the stated purpose; theres always hope for version two.\nWhile we love the look and feel of this build and the subtle nods to the cyberpunk aesthetic, it sure seems like you could get some serious work done with a deck like this. Hats off to [Hans] for the build, and heres hoping he left some of those cool cases for the rest of us.\n\n", "title": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8 Kali Linux \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad: 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4e88\u5099\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "body": "\u6700\u8fd1\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001Kali Linux\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002US Army\u306e1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002(Self Destruct\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3082\u642d\u8f09)\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8 Kali Linux \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad: 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4e88\u5099\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad: US Army Signal Corps\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u5229\u7528  ", "\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u5236\u4f5c  ", "Raspberry Pi 5\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad: 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u88c5\u98fe  ", "Cyberpunk\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u5236\u4f5c: \u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09"]}

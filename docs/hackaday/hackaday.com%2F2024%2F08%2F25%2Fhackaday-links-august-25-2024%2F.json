According to the sun watchers at the Space Weather Prediction Center, on August 8, the Solar Dynamics Observatory snapped a picture that was positively bedazzled with sunspots. Counting methods vary, but one count put the sunspot number at a whopping 337 that day. That would be the largest number since 2001, during the peak of Solar Cycle 23. The sunspot number is highly correlated with solar storms and coronal mass ejections; more spots mean more magnetic activity and more chance for something to go very, very wrong. Weve been pretty lucky so far with Solar Cycle 25; despite being much more active than the relatively lazy Cycle 24 and much stronger than predicted, most of this cycles outbursts have been directed away from Earth or only dealt us a glancing blow. Seeing all those spots, though, makes us think its only a matter of time before we get hit with something that does more than make pretty lights.\n\nHaving done our share of roofing, we can safely say its a pretty tough job. Everything is heavy, its either boiling hot or freezing cold, and one moments inattention can make for a very bad day. Plus, the fiberglass shards in your skin at the end of the day can be incredibly annoying. On the other hand, a good roofing job is a thing of beauty, and theres immense satisfaction in having been the one to do it. But, with apologies to Steve Miller, time keeps on slipping into the future, humans are expensive and unreliable, and someone will eventually try to automate humans out of pretty much every job.\nIts roofings turn now with the aptly named Rufus auto roof robot. Its a hybrid robot with a base unit containing a hopper for shingles and a SCARA arm that positions, aligns, and nails down the shingles. The base unit, in turn, is moved around the surface of the roof by a capstan-drive cable robot, with cables anchored to the corners of the roof.\nIts an interesting idea, but one thats going to take some development to make it practical. For one thing, we can see safety regulators having a fit over those cables, which will be a tripping hazard for the workers who have to keep the bot fed with shingles and nails. Also, a roof thats completely free of obstructions like vent stacks, skylights, or chimneys is a rare roof indeed, and it seems like the cable system would foul on such obstructions very easily. Still, youve got to start somewhere, and itll be interesting to see how this develops. Or maybe well just throw Atlas at it.\nHead up, hams  another spectrum land grab appears to be underway. This one is a little hard to follow, but what we see is that a company called NexNav, which is currently licensed for a Location and Monitoring Service in the 900-MHz band, wants to split the 902 MHz to 928 MHz band and start blasting out high-powered signals on the upper part of the band, apparently for a new 5G position system that will serve as a backup to satellite location systems like GPS. The problem is that amateur radio operators have a secondary allocation in that band, which, despite the companys unsupported claims to the contrary, will most likely be swamped by their 2,000-watt effective radiated power signals. LoRaWAN fans might also take note of the proposed change, which would likely make life difficult for them and other ISM-band users. It might be time to write some strongly worded letters.\nAnd finally, what a time to be alive! While Boeing has figured out how to turn the ISS into a low-earth orbit Gilligans Island by unintentionally extending an eight-day visit into an open-ended stay, down here on Earth, were tackling the real problems, like how to safely eat Doritos in space. Luckily, the food scientists at Frito-Lay put their top people on the problem and came up with Cool Ranch Zero Gravity Doritos, which substitute a flavored oil spray for the normal finger-staining powdered spice blend that would get everywhere in an environment where gravity doesnt pull it down onto your shirt or into your neck-beard. And to keep cornmeal crumbs from getting loose, they shrunk the triangular chips down to about a third the size of a regular Dorito, so you can just stuff the whole chip in your mouth without biting it first.\nWe have many thoughts on this, primarily that being unable to stuff at least three regular-size Doritos in your mouth at one time should be grounds for disqualification from spaceflight and that they literally could have chosen any flavor to send to space, but they had to make it Cool Ranch, which raises many questions of its own. But mainly, were just sad that this is what has become of spaceflight  and yes, we know about Tang, but this seems a lot worse.", "title": "\u592a\u967d\u89b3\u6e2c\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u6a39\u7acb\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u592a\u967d\u6d3b\u52d5\u304c\u6d3b\u767a\u3067\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u6a39\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u30022021\u5e748\u67088\u65e5\u3001\u592a\u967d\u306e\u9ed2\u70b9\u6570\u306f337\u306b\u9054\u3057\u30012001\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u6700\u5927\u3002\u592a\u967d\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u304c\u5897\u3059\u3068\u3001\u78c1\u6c17\u6d3b\u52d5\u3084\u592a\u967d\u5d50\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3082\u9ad8\u307e\u308b\u3002\u8981\u7d04\u6587\uff1a\u592a\u967d\u304c\u6d3b\u767a\u3067\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9\u8a18\u9332\u304c\u51fa\u305f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "titles": ["\u592a\u967d\u89b3\u6e2c\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u6a39\u7acb\u304b\uff1f", "\u5c4b\u6839\u4f5c\u696d\u3078\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\uff1aRufus\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30d5\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\uff1a902\u301c928 MHz\u5e2f\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u4e89\u596a\u6226", "ISS\u306b\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u5730\u3092\uff1a\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9577\u671f\u6ede\u5728\u554f\u984c", "\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u98df\u4e8b\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306eDoritos\u306e\u98df\u3079\u65b9\u306b\u65b0\u63d0\u6848"]}

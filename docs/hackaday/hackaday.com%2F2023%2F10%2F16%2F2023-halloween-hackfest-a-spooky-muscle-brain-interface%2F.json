Something more perennial, or even something that could also be found in a classroom or lab. Something like [Markus Bindhammer]s spooky muscle-brain interface. It was inspired by a series called Tales From the Loop in which a characters muscle electrical activity is measured in preparation to adjust his prosthetic hand.\nEssentially, it does what you think it does: attach the sensors to your muscles, move them around, and watch the brain light up. [Markus] started with a childrens learning kit that involves molding the brain and discs out of red rubbery goop, the vertebrae out of plaster, and then assembling the whole thing.\nInstead, [Markus] molded the brain and vertebrae in two-part silicone for durability, and used two-component colored epoxy for the discs.\nAs the inspiring series is set in the 80s (we assume the brown, dingy 80s and not the fun, neon 80s), [Markus] gave the enclosure/stand an appropriate color scheme. Inside that box theres an Arduino Pro Micro, a Grove EMG detector, and a mini step-up converter module. And of course, under the brain, theres a NeoPixel ring. Dont miss the build and demo video after the break.\nThere are a ton of things you can do with blinkenlights for Halloween. How about a light-up candy slide, or a bucket that seems them coming?\n\n\n \n\n"}

Doing this by hand is possible, but tedious, ergo an autosampler can save a lot of time and tedium. Being not incredibly complex devices that have a lot in common with e.g. FDM 3D printers and CNC machines, it makes perfect sense to build one yourself, as [Markus Bindhammer] of\u00a0Marbs Lab on YouTube has done.\nThe specific design that [Markus] went for uses a sample carousel that can hold up to 30 bottles of 20 mL each. An ATmega-based board forms the brain of the machine, which can operate either independently or be controlled via I2C or serial. The axes and carousel are controlled by three stepper motors, each of which is driven by a TB6600 microstep driver.\nWhy this design is a time saver should be apparent, as you can load the carousel with bottles and have the autosampler handle the work over the course of however long the entire process takes instead of tying up a human. Initially the autosampler will be used for the synthesis of cadmium-selenium quantum dots, before it will be put to work for an HPLC/spectrometer project.\nAlthough [Markus] intends this to be an open hardware and software project, it will take a bit longer to get all the files and documentation organized. Until then we will have to keep manually sampling, or use the video as the construction tutorial.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u6642\u9593\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\u3067\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u6642\u9593\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- ATmega\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5236\u4f5c", "- 30\u672c\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u6271\u3046\u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u4f5c\u308a", "- \u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

But not just any rope \u2013 especially non-stretchy rope for using in a mechanical context. The hack in question was a bicycle wheel that swapped out normal metal spokes for lighter and stronger high-density polypropylene weave, and if you can tension up a bike wheel and ride it around, you know it\u2019s not your garden-variety twine.\nNow, it just so happens that I\u2019ve got basically the same stuff in my parts drawer: some 1 mm diamaeter Dyneema-brand rope. This is an amazing material. It\u2019s rated to a breaking strength of 195 kg (430 lbs) yet it weighs just under one gram per meter, and if you buy the pre-stretched variant, it\u2019s guaranteed to stretch less than 1% of its length under load. It\u2019s flexible, wears well, and is basically in every way superior to braided steel wire.\nIt\u2019s nearly magical, and it\u2019s just what you need if you\u2019re making a cable robot or anything where the extreme strength and non-elongation characteristic are important. It\u2019s one of those things that there\u2019s just no substitute for when you need it, and that\u2019s why I have some in my secret-ingredients drawer. What else is in there? Some high-temperature tape, low-temperature solder, and ultra-light-weight M3 PEEK screws for airplane building.\nBut our conversation got me thinking about the parts, materials, and products that are unique: for which there is just no reasonable substitute. I\u2019m sure the list gets longer the more interesting projects or disciplines that you\u2019re into. What are your secret ingredients, and what\u2019s the specific niche that they fit into?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

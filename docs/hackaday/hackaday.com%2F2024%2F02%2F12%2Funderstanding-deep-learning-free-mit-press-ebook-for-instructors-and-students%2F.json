D. Prince] is notable not only for focusing primarily on the concepts behind Deep Learning  which should make it highly accessible to most  but also in that it can be either purchased as a hardcover from MIT Press or downloaded for free from the Understanding Deep Learning website. If you intend to use it for coursework, a separate instructor answer booklet and other resources can be purchased, but student resources like Python notebooks are also freely available. In the books preface, the author invites readers to send feedback whenever they find an issue.\n\nIn the preface, the joke contained in the title is also explained, as nobody really understands deep learning algorithms, even though they are beginning to underlie more and more of modern society, ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in machine vision to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) commonly used in large language models that often are ascribed near-magical properties which they most definitely do not possess. Weve likened it to a bad summer intern, although they are getting better almost daily.\nThe book and materials look like a solid introduction to learning about the ideas behind these deep learning algorithms for anyone even mildly curious about the topic, and you cant complain about the price."}

It was relatively easy to implement, didnt require anything special on the printer to accomplish, and testing showed it was effective enough to pursue further. Unfortunately, there was some patent concerns, and it seemed like nobody wanted to be the first to step up and actually implement the feature.\nWell, as of today, [Roman Tenger] has decided to answer the call. As explained in the announcement video below, the company that currently holds the US patent for this tech hasnt filed a European counterpart, so he feels hes in a fairly safe spot compared to other creators in the community. We salute his bravery, and wish him nothing but the best of luck should any lawyer come knocking.\nSo how does it work? Right now the script supports PrusaSlicer and OrcaSlicer, and the installation is the same in both cases  just download the Python file, and go into your slicers settings under Post-Processing Scripts and enter in its path. As of right now youll have to provide the target layer height as an option to the script, but were willing to bet thats going to be one of the first things that gets improved as the community starts sending in pull requests for the GPL v3 licensed script.\nThere was a lot of interest in this technique when we covered it last, and were very excited to see an open source implementation break cover. Now that its out in the wild, wed love to hear about it in the comments if you try it out.\n\n\nThanks to [greg_bear] in the Hackaday Discord for the tip.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u6280\u8853", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u5c64\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5b9f\u88c5\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u6280\u8853", "- Roman Tenger\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5b9f\u88c5\u304c\u767b\u5834", "- \u7279\u8a31\u554f\u984c\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- PrusaSlicer\u3068OrcaSlicer\u7528\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "- \u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5171\u6709\uff01\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

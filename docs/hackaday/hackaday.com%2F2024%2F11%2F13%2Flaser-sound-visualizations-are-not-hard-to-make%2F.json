In fact, its remarkably simple if you want it to be, and [byte_thrasher] shows us just how easy it can be.\nAt heart, what youre trying to do is make a laser trace out waveforms of the music youre listening to, right? So you just need a way to move the lasers beam along with the sound waves from whatever youre listening to. You might be thinking about putting a laser on the head of a servo-operated platform fed movement instructions from a digital music file, but youd be way over-complicating things. You already have something that moves with the music you play  a speaker!\n[byte_thrashers] concept is simple. Get a Bluetooth speaker, and stick it in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a flexible membrane, like plastic wrap. Stick a small piece of mirror on the plastic. When you play music with the speaker, the mirror will vibrate and move in turn. All you then have to do is aim a safe laser in a safe direction such that it bounces off the mirror and projects on to a surface. Then, the laser will dance with your tunes, and itll probably look pretty cool!\nWeve seen some beautiful laser visual effects before, too. Just be careful and keep your power levels safe and your beams pointing where they should be.\n\n\nput a bluetooth speaker in a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap pulled taut, glue a shard of mirror to the plastic wrap, point a laser beam at the mirror so that it bounces off towards the ceiling, play music, enjoy pic.twitter.com/Vs6lBJihCg\n avi (@byte_thrasher) November 9, 2024\n", "title": "- \u97f3\u697d\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8996\u899a\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3001Bluetooth\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u93e1\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u7c21\u5358\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u97f3\u697d\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8996\u899a\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u9023\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u639b\u3051", "- \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u6ce2\u5f62\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u5168\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u632f\u52d5\u306e\u8996\u899a\u8868\u73fe\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

Not satisfied with a simple bedtime reminder notification  such things are easily dismissed, after all  [Will] is offloading self-control onto a robot which will take his phone away at bedtime.\nScrolling in bed is allowed up to a prescribed time. At that time, a rack and pinion-mounted arm rises up from behind his mattress, presenting an open hand, ready to accept the object of his addiction. At this point, a countdown begins. If he does not hand over the device in a matter of seconds, the robot escalates by flashing obnoxiously bright lights in his face.\nThe nocturnal technology detox is not absolute, however. A button allows [Will] to temporarily retrieve his phone after it has been confiscated. This safety override accounts for the Inevitable situation where he will need to send a last-minute text before nodding off. The flashing light disincentive countdown is restarted upon retrieval, ensuring that [Will] does not cheat his own system for additional scroll time.\nAs a brief sidebar, [Will] does a nice job explaining how pulse-width modulation works for the purpose of controlling the speed of the rack and pinion mechanism.\nFor more of [Wills] projects see this iPad suspension system a Lamp that tracks the location of the ISS and a drum that uses the piezoelectric effect to charge mobile devices.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u6ca1\u53ce\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u7761\u7720\u3078", "body": "\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u7761\u7720\u6539\u5584\u306e\u305f\u3081\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u6ca1\u53ce\u3055\u305b\u3001\u81ea\u5df1\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u6ca1\u53ce\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u7761\u7720\u3078", "\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30b3\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5236\u9650\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u59d4\u306d\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5bdd\u308b\u7fd2\u6163", "\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u5e45\u5909\u8abf\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u6bce\u6669\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u30c7\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6a5f\u69cb"]}

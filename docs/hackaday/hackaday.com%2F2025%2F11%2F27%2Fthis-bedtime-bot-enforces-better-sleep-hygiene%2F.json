Not satisfied with a simple bedtime reminder notification  such things are easily dismissed, after all  [Will] is offloading self-control onto a robot which will take his phone away at bedtime.\nScrolling in bed is allowed up to a prescribed time. At that time, a rack and pinion-mounted arm rises up from behind his mattress, presenting an open hand, ready to accept the object of his addiction. At this point, a countdown begins. If he does not hand over the device in a matter of seconds, the robot escalates by flashing obnoxiously bright lights in his face.\nThe nocturnal technology detox is not absolute, however. A button allows [Will] to temporarily retrieve his phone after it has been confiscated. This safety override accounts for the Inevitable situation where he will need to send a last-minute text before nodding off. The flashing light disincentive countdown is restarted upon retrieval, ensuring that [Will] does not cheat his own system for additional scroll time.\nAs a brief sidebar, [Will] does a nice job explaining how pulse-width modulation works for the purpose of controlling the speed of the rack and pinion mechanism.\nFor more of [Wills] projects see this iPad suspension system a Lamp that tracks the location of the ISS and a drum that uses the piezoelectric effect to charge mobile devices.\n\n"}

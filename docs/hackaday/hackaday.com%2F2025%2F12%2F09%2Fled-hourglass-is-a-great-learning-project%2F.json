[EDISON SCIENCE CORNER] has built a digital project that mimics such a thing, with little beads of light emulating falling sand in the timekeepers of old.\nThe build is designed around the Arduino platform, and can be constructed with an Arduino Uno, Nano, or Pro Mini if so desired. The microcontroller board is hooked up with an ADXL335 three-axis accelerometer, which is used for tracking the orientation and movement of the digital hourglass. These movements are used to influence the movement of emulated grains of sand, displayed on a pair of 88 LED matrixes driven by a MAX7219 driver IC. Power is courtesy of a 3.7 V lithium-ion cell, with a charge/boost module included for good measure. Everything is wrapped up in a vaguely hourglass-shaped 3D printed enclosure.\nThe operation is simple. When the hourglass is turned, the simulated grains of sand move as if responding to gravity. The movement is a little janky  no surprise given the limited resolution of the 88 displays. You also probably wouldnt use such a device as a timer when more elegant solutions exist. However, thats not to say builds like this dont have a purpose. Theyre actually a great way to get to grips with a microcontroller platform, as well as to learn about interfacing external hardware and working with LED matrixes. You can pick up a great deal of basic skills building something like this.\nWould you believe this isnt the first digital hourglass weve featured on the site?\n\n", "title": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01Arduino\u3067\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001Arduino\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3001LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u7802\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u6a21\u5023\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01Arduino\u3067\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "ADXL335\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7802\u306e\u8868\u73fe", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u7802\u6642\u8a08\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

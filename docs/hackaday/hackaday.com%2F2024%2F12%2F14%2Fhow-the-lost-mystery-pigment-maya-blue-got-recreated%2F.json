What makes it so interesting is not only its rich palette  ranging from bright turquoise to a dark greenish blue  but also its remarkable durability. Only a small number of blue pigments were created by ancient civilizations, and even among those Maya blue is unique. The secret of its creation was thought to be lost, until ceramicist and artist [Luis May Ku] rediscovered it.\nMaya blue is not just a dye, nor a ground-up mineral like lapis lazuli. It is an unusual and highly durable organic-inorganic hybrid; the result of a complex chemical process that involves two colorants. Here is how it is made: Indigotin is a dye extracted from choj, the Mayan name for a specific indigenous indigo plant. That extract is combined with a very specific type of clay. Heating the mixture in an oven both stabilizes it produces a second colorant: dehydroindigo. Together, this creates Maya blue.\nLuis May Ku posing with Maya blue.\nThe road to rediscovery was not a simple one. While the chemical makeup and particulars of Maya blue had been known for decades, the nuts and bolts of actually making it, not to mention sourcing the correct materials, and determining the correct techniques, was a long road. [May] made progress by piecing together invaluable ancestral knowledge and finally cracked the code after a lot of time and effort and experimentation. He remembers the moment of watching a batch shift in color from a soft blue to a vibrant turquoise, and knew he had finally done it.\nBefore synthetic blue pigments arrived on the scene after the industrial revolution, blue was rare and highly valuable in Europe. The Spanish exploitation of the New World included controlling Maya blue until synthetic blue colorants arrived on the scene, after which Maya blue faded from common knowledge. [May]s rediscovered formula marks the first time the world has seen genuine Maya blue made using its original formula and methods in almost two hundred years.\nMaya blue is a technological wonder of the ancient world, and its rediscovery demonstrates the resilience and scientific value of ancestral knowledge as well as the ingenuity of those dedicated to reviving lost arts.\nWere reminded that paints and coatings have long been fertile ground for experimentation, and as an example weve seen the success people had in re-creating an ultra-white paint that actually has a passive cooling effect.", "title": "\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u53e4\u4ee3\u30de\u30e4\u306e\u9752\u8272\u9854\u6599\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "body": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u30de\u30e4\u306e\u9752\u8272\u9854\u6599\u300c\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u300d\u306f\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3061\u518d\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u53e4\u4ee3\u30de\u30e4\u306e\u9752\u8272\u9854\u6599\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u6cd5\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b\u3057\u305f\u30eb\u30a4\u30b9\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30fb\u30af", "\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u751f\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\uff1a\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6709\u6a5f\u7121\u6a5f\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9", "\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77e5\u6075\u304c\u751f\u3093\u3060\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u5408\u6210\u9854\u6599\u304c\u652f\u914d\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u3067\u306e\u30de\u30e4\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u4fa1\u5024"]}

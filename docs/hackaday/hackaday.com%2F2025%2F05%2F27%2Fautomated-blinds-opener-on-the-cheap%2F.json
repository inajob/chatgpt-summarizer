[Simon], in a quick weekend build, created an automated blinds opener using parts he had available.\nThe project began with the desire to have his blinds open slowly and silently, gradually letting in more light. To accomplish this, a few key components were needed, including a motor with a gearbox to provide the torque required to actuate the blinds and a magnetic encoder to track their progress. To isolate vibrations and keep the system silent, the motor is mounted using a silicone motor mount that he salvaged from a broken water flosser.\nThe printed holder for the magnetic encoder is a nice touch.\nTo mount the motor to the wall near the window, he used some 3D printed parts. A clever combination of surgical silicone tubing and silicone tape attaches the motor to the window blind shaft while limiting vibration transfer, keeping things quiet. [Simon] advises against using magnetic encoders as he did, noting that while he had them on hand and made them work, the magnetic shaft\u2019s misalignment with the encoders makes it a less-than-ideal approach. Nevertheless, he got it working.\nAutomating blinds is a fairly common project around these parts, made all the more accessible with clever 3D printed mechanisms. Weve even seen variations that can be used in rentals, dorms, and other places were permanent modifications need to be avoided."}

But like most such devices there are a variety of roles it can fill. The part can be used to drive relays or motors (either brushed or stepper), it can drive LED lighting, or simply act as a signal buffer. [Hulk] provides some great examples, so be sure to check it out if youre curious.\nEach of the Darlington pairs (which act as single NPN transistors) is configured as open collector, and the usual way this is used is to switch some kind of load to ground. Since the inputs can be driven directly from 5 V digital logic, this part allows something like a microcontroller to drive a high current (or high voltage, or both) device it wouldnt normally be able to interface with.\nWhile the circuitry to implement each of the transistor arrays isnt particularly complex and can be easily built by hand, a part like this is a real space saver due to how it packs everything needed in a handy package. Each output can handle 500 mA, but this can be increased by connecting in parallel.\nTheres a video (embedded below) which steps through everything youd like to know about the ULN2003. Should you find yourself wanting a much, much closer look at the inner secrets of this chip, how about a gander at the decapped die?\n\n", "title": "ULN2003 IC\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u6df1\u3044\u6d1e\u5bdf", "body": "ULN2003 IC\u306f\u591a\u76ee\u7684\u3067\u3001\u30c0\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u30da\u30a2\u30927\u3064\u5185\u8535\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u3084\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u99c6\u52d5\u3001LED\u7167\u660e\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u306a\u3069\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30c3\u30c8\u306f5V\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3001\u5404\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30d7\u30c3\u30c8\u306f500mA\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u6271\u3048\u308b\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3002", "titles": ["ULN2003 IC\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u6df1\u3044\u6d1e\u5bdf", "ULN2003 IC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "ULN2003 IC\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "ULN2003 IC\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u4e8b\u4f8b", "ULN2003 IC\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u3076: \u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3084\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f"]}

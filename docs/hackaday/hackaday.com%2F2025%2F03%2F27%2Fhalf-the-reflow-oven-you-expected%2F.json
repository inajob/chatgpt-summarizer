Take a toaster oven, an Arduino, and a thermocouple, and bake those boards! But [Paul J R] has found a new take on an old project, and better still, hes found the most diminutive of toaster ovens from the Australian version of Kmart. We love the project for the tiny oven alone.\nThe brains of the operation is an ESP32, in the form of either a TTGO TTDisplay board or an S3-Zero board on a custom carrier PCB, with a thermistor rather than a thermocouple for the temperature sensing, and a solid state relay to control mains power for the heater. All the resources are in a GitHub repository, but you may have to make do with a more conventionally-sized table top toaster oven if youre not an Aussie.\nIf youre interested, but want a better controller board, weve got you covered."}

Thus, he set out to build a better actuator to support his goals of building a high-performance walking bot in future.\n[Aaed] decided to try and build a quasi-direct drive actuator, similar to those used in MITs agile mini Cheetah robot. It consists of a powerful brushless DC motor driving a 9:1 planetary gear reduction built with 3D printed parts, which provides high torque output. Its designed to be run with an ODrive S1 motor controller with encoder feedback for precise control.\nThe actuator weighs in at a total of 935 grams. Its not cheap, with the bill of materials totaling just under $250. For your money, though, you get a responsive robotic actuator with a hefty holding torque of over 16 Nm, which [Aaed] demonstrates by having the actuator shake around some dumbells on a long lever arm.\nWalking robots have exploded in popularity ever since Spot hit the scene. Weve seen everything from complex builds to super-simple single-servo designs.\n\n"}

[This Does Not Compute] takes us through the history of the AlphaSmart word processor which started as an educational tool, but finds itself in many a writers bag today.\nThe original AlphaSmart bears more than a passing resemblance to its Apple contemporaries since the company was founded by two Apple engineers. The Cupertino company didnt see the value in the concept, but didnt lean on any non-competes to keep the pair from pursuing the idea on their own time either. What resulted was a dead simple word processor that could be had for 1/5 of what a new computer typically cost in the era, which was particularly attractive for the target market of schools.\nAfter several successful years, the pressure of PDAs and then smartphones from one side and cheaper laptops from the other meant school districts no longer wanted single-purpose devices when they could have a fully-fledged computing experience for students. We wonder if that was the right call, with so many now wanting distraction-free devices, but it was the end of the road for the company either way.\nOur own [Kristina Panos] and [Tom Nardi] have shown us the guts of the Neo and of one of its competitors, the Writer, respectively. If you have a Neo of your own in need of replacement keycaps, you can print them.\n\n", "title": "AlphaSmart\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "body": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u306fApple\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u8a2d\u7acb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4eba\u6c17\u3092\u535a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u5e02\u5834\u5411\u3051\u306b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u306e\u5229\u7528\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3084\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3059\u308b\u3068\u9700\u8981\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u3057\u3001\u4f1a\u793e\u306f\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u306f\u9589\u9396\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["AlphaSmart\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "AlphaSmart: Apple\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5275\u696d", "\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aAlphaSmart", "\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u307f\uff1fAlphaSmart\u306e\u6311\u6226", "Neo\u3068Writer: AlphaSmart\u7af6\u5408\u4ed6\u793e\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

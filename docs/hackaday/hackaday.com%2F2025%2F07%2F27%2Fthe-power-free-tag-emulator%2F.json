The reader creates an RF field that has enough energy to power the electronics in the tag; when the tag wakes up, two-way communication ensues. Were accustomed to blank tags that can be reprogrammed, and devices like the Flipper Zero that can emulate a tag. In between those two is [MCUer]s power-free tag emulator, a board which uses NFC receiver hardware to power a small microcontroller that can run emulation code.\nThe microcontroller in question is the low-power CW32L010 from Wuhan Xinyuan Semiconductor, a Chinese part with an ARM Cortex M0+ on board. Unfortunately, thats where the interesting news ends, because all we can glean from the GitHub repository is a PCB layout. Not even a circuit diagram, which we hope is an unintended omission rather than deliberate. It does, however, lend itself to the fostering of ideas, because if this designer cant furnish a schematic, then perhaps you can. Its not difficult to make an NFC receiver, so perhaps you can hook one up to a microcontroller and be the one who shares the circuit.", "title": "NFC\u30bf\u30b0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f\uff1aMCUer\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "MCUer\u306e\u7121\u96fb\u6e90NFC\u30bf\u30b0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3066\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u56de\u8def\u56f3\u304c\u672a\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["NFC\u30bf\u30b0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f\uff1aMCUer\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306eNFC\u30bf\u30b0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "NFC\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "CW32L010\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "NFC\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

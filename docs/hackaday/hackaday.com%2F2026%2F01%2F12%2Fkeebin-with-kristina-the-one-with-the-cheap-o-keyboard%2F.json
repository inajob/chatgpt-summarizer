The point was to make a very affordable keyboard  all the parts come to ~40 Euro (~$47). So it would seem that [Lander03xD_] succeeded.\nImage by [Lander03xD_] via redditCheap03xD is all the things  36-key, split, column-staggered, wireless, hot-swappable, and uses ZMK. The batteries are easily replaceable, and no they dont get in the way.\nThose are MMD Princess silent switches, which I wouldnt choose, but [Lander03xD_] is taking this board to the office, so I get it. They sure are a nice shade of pink, anyway, and they go really well with the pastels of the DSA keycaps and the bezel.\nOne cool thing to note is that the PCBs are reversible, like the ErgoDox. This isnt [Lander03xD_]s first board, and it wont be the last.\nNow, lets talk batteries. [Saixos] pointed out that the design doesnt appear to include a protection circuit. In case you cant tell from where youre sitting, those are nice!nano clones that [Lander03xD_] is using, and they expect a protection circuit.\n[Lander03xD_] is going to look through the docs and see whats what. The goal is not to have any daughter boards, so this may take some rethinking.\nVia reddit\n\nArc Raiders Keyboard Looks the Part\nSo Arc Raiders is this cool-looking, stripe-logoed, multiplayer extraction shooter that just came out a couple of months ago for all the platforms. Its not something I could personally play as its way too immersive (read: time-consuming), but it definitely looks good, much like this keyboard that [RunRunAndyRun] designed to play it.\nImage by [RunRunAndyRun] via redditHaving enjoyed the game with a game pad for a couple of weeks, [RunRunAndyRun] longed for the precision of a keyboard and mouse. The only problem was that his stock of split keyboards all lack a number row.\nNo matter; just make a new one. Why not? This rustic beauty runs on the Waveshare RP2040 Zero.\u00a0The case was 3D printed on a Prusa Mk4, which youd never know unless you blew up the picture. And then [RunRunAndyRun] gave it that nice patina using Panduro hobby acrylics and a bit of weathering powder.\nFor now, its working pretty well, though [RunRunAndyRun] is still perfecting the keymap. If youd like to build one yourself, the STLs are available here, and the firmware is on GitHub.\nThanks for the tip, [John]!\nThe Centerfold: Witchs Brew\nImage by [CaptLynx] via redditThis stunning beauty, Witchs Brew, was created by [CaptLynx] with the Cosmos keyboard configurator. Doesnt sound familiar? Its the one that uses a scan of your hand to create your ultimate comfort. This keyboard is a custom build for a commission. I must say, as much as I dislike the work of Jackson Pollock, I do absolutely love the spatter on those keycaps.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Keystone\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nThis spartan beauty was named after the state in which it was made, Pennsylvania. Manufactured between 1898 and 1903, the Keystone was invented by William Prehn Quentell.\nQuentell was living in Kansas City, MO when he first applied for a patent, and later moved to the east coast. At the time, the machine was nameless. The patent looks nothing like the finished product pictured here, but the genesis of the key feature of this poor mans Hammond is there  the swinging type sector.\nWhat this means is that the Keystone has its type on a half wagon wheel, which is evident in the patent drawing. The glyphs are molded around the outside edge of the wheel, which gets rotated into the correct position with each keystroke. This type wheel could be easily changed out for different fonts.\nImage via Google Patents\nTo imprint the paper, a spring-driven hammer strikes from behind, pushing the paper and ribbon against the type wheel. The paper is loaded into a cylindrical holder in the rear, and unfurls as one types.\nSo, why was it a poor mans Hammond? Well, for one, the patent image looks like a Hammond. But the poor part is felt the hardest in the makeup of the typewriter.\nIn the early Keystone examples, the carriage rails were made of pig iron. Why? Its a simple case of lateral integration. The factory that was retrofitted to manufacture the machine had previously been the Lochiel iron mill, a producer of pig iron. They were just using up old stock, I imagine.\nThe Keystone featured two Shift keys on the left, one for Caps and one for Figures. It was a comparatively inexpensive at $40, and then later, $35 (around $1,200 today).\nProduction was supposed to begin in May of 1898. But by June of 99, the company has been unable to fill the orders which are piling up at the works. Sounds like your average Kickstarter. Quentell was already working on his next project by 1902, the Postal typewriter.\nFinally, a Keyboard That Charges Your Phone\nSo this article mainly centers on the new little Blackberry-esque number from Clicks which might just be my next phone, except that it doesnt actually telephone. Clicks is meant to be your second phone, the one you use for emailing and such. You can pre-order it for $399 if you put a $199 deposit down before February 27th. If you decide to drop the full four hundo as an early bird, youll get two additional back covers, which slightly change the look of the phone.\nImage by Clicks via TechCrunch\nBut Id like to talk about the add-on Power Keyboard for smart phones that Clicks is also dropping at CES this year. Do you miss your Sidekick? Well, heres a sliding keyboard with multiple positions for differently-sized smart phones, tablets, and even smart TVs. (Because forget typing with the remote control.)\nIt uses a 2,150 mAh battery and attaches via MagSafe or Qi2, but it also can be used with the case on. When paired with a smart TV, you just use it by itself. Honestly, it looks kind of hard to type on without the phone for support. But I dont use the smart features of my TV, so whatever.\nHonestly, I will probably start by getting the keyboard, which is $79 for early birds through their site, and $109 later on. Pre-orders started a week ago, so I guess I should get on that.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two.

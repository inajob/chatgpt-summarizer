Since antiquity there have been various forms of armor designed to protect the wearer, but thankfully these days random sword fights dont often break out on the street. Still, [SCREEN TESTED] wanted to test the viability of 3D printed chain mail  if not for actual combat, at least for re-enactment purposes.\nHe uses tough PLA to crank out a bed worth of what looks like [ZeroAlligator]s PipeLink Chainmail Fabric, which just so happens to be the trending result on Bambus MakerWorld currently. The video shows several types of mail on the printer, but the test dummy only gets the one H-type pattern, which is a pity  theres a whole realm of tests waiting to be done on different mail patterns and filament types.\nIn any case, the mail holds up fairly well to puncture from scissors and screwdrivers  with a heavy sweater or proper gambeson (a quilted cloth underlayer commonly worn with armor) on underneath, it looks like it could actually protect you. To slashing blows, PLA holds up astoundingly well, barely marked even by slashes from an actual sword. As for projectiles, well, everyone knows that to an arrow, chain mail is made of holes, and this PLA-based armor is no different (as you can see at 8:30 in the video below).\nIf you want to be really safe when the world goes Mad Max, youd probably want actual chain mail, perhaps from stainless steel. On the other hand, if someone tries to mug you on the way home from a con, cosplay armor might actually keep you safer than one might first suspect. Its not great armor, but its a great result for homemade plastic armor.\nOf course youd still be better off with Stepahnie Kwoleks great invention, Kevlar.\n\n"}

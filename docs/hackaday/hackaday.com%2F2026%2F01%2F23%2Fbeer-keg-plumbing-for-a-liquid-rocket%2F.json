Beer kegs? No? Well, when [Ryan] from the YouTube channel \u201cProject KegRocket\u201d saw a beer keg, the first thing he and his friends saw was a pressurized rocket body.\nYou wouldn\u2019t be crazy if the first thing you thought of was something designed by a massive company or university. Liquid rockets are far from simple to develop, with Keg Rocket being no exception. Liquid oxygen and alcohol is the oxidizer/fuel mixture of choice. Liquid oxygen in particular is a problem with its cryogenic temperatures and tendency to do what rocket fuel does best, burn. This problem causes a large amount of work to simply connect the pipes. Traditional O-rings have no chance at surviving, along with most other non-metallic solutions.\n\nEven with all these problems, the group creating the piece of art is more than capable, having experience creating similar rockets in the past. As of currently, the pumping has been pressure and leak checked. We will be watching this project closely for updates and an eventual launch.\nFor more rocketry science, be sure to check out aerospike engines for the most efficient engines around.

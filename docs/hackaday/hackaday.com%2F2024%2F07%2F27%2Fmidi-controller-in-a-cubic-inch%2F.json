Since the 80s, it has it has revolutionized the way music is produced and performed, allowing for seamless integration of digital instruments, automation of complex sequences, and unprecedented control over everything from production to editing. It has also resulted in a number of musical instruments that probably wouldnt be possible without electronic help, like this MIDI instrument which might be the worlds smallest.\nFitting into a cubic inch of space, the tiny instruments volume is mostly taken up by the MIDI connector itself which was perhaps an acceptable size by 1980s standards but seems rather bulky today. A two-layer PCB split into three sections sandwiches the connector in place and boasts an ATtiny85 microcontroller and all the associated electronics needed to implement MIDI. Small threaded screws hold the platform together and provide each layer with a common ground. Four small pushbuttons at the top of the device act as the instruments keys.\nThe projects creator (and Hackaday alum!)\u00a0[Jeremy Cook] has it set up to play notes from a piano right now, but has also made the source code available so that any musical action can be programmed onto these buttons. Flexibility is perhaps MIDIs greatest strength and why the standard has lasted for decades now, as it makes it fairly straightforward to build more comprehensive, easy-to-learn musical instruments or even musical instruments out of retro video game systems.\n\n", "title": "MIDI\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u697d\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "MIDI\u6a19\u6e96\u306f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u3067\u300180\u5e74\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u3084\u6f14\u594f\u3092\u5909\u9769\u3001\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u697d\u5668\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u3068\u5236\u5fa1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3068\u3057\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306aMIDI\u697d\u5668\u3082\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u3002Jeremy Cook\u6c0f\u306f\u5c0f\u578b\u697d\u5668\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u30d5\u30ec\u30ad\u30b7\u30d6\u30eb\u306aMIDI\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u306f\u3001\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u306b\u308f\u305f\u308a\u7d9a\u304f\u539f\u52d5\u529b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["MIDI\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u697d\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "MIDI\u6a19\u6e96\u304c\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u9769\u547d", "MIDI\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u697d\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "ATtiny85\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fMIDI\u697d\u5668", "MIDI\u306e\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b"]}

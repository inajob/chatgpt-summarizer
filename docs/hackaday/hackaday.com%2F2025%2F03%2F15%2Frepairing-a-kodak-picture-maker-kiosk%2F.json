However, there was a time when they were everywhere. The idea was that if you didnt have a good printer at home, you could take your digital files to a kiosk, pay your money, and run off some high-quality images. [Snappiness] snagged one, and if youve ever wondered what was inside of one, heres your chance.\nWhile later models used a Windows PC inside, this one is old enough to have a Sun computer. That also means that it had things like PCMCIA slots and a film scanner. Unfortunately, it wasnt working because of a bad touch screen. The box was looking for a network on boot, which required some parameter changes. The onboard battery is dead, too, so you have to change the parameters on every boot. However, the real killer was the touchscreen, which the software insists on finding before it will start.\nThe monitor is an old device branded as a Kodak monitor and, of course, is unavailable. [Snappiness] found pictures of another kiosk online and noted that the monitor was from Elo, a common provider of point-of-sale screens. Could the Kodak monitor just be an Elo with a new badge? It turns out it probably was because a new Elo monitor did the trick.\nOf course, what excited us was that if we found one of these in a scrap pile, it might have a Sun workstation inside. Of course, you can just boot Solaris on your virtual PC today. You might be surprised that Kodak invented the digital camera. But they failed to understand what it would mean to the future of photography.\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u306f\u304b\u3064\u3066\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306f\u53e4\u3044Sun\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3001\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u6545\u969c\u304c\u554f\u984c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30aa\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u30b5\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u52a3\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- Kodak\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8b0e\u3068Elo\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2", "- Kodak\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u767a\u660e\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u6559\u8a13"]}

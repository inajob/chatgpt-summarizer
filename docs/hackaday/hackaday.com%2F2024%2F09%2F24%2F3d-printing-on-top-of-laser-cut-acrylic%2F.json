The obvious way to do this was to bond the acrylic sheet to the bed with glue temporarily, but another way was tried, and its much less messy and precarious.\nThe bond between a 3D print and acrylic is very strong\nThe first step was to create a 3D model which combined a constraining fence to contain the acrylic panel with the required artwork floating above. It was easy enough to run the print long enough to build the fence, then pause the print mid-way to add the pristine panel and restart after a quick re-prime and wipe.\nThere were a few simple takeaways from the video below. First, to ensure sufficient tolerance between the fence and the panel, consider the layer width (plus associated tolerance when printed) and the laser kerf of your machines to ensure a not-too-sloppy fit. Secondly, that hot nozzle wont do the acrylic surface any favours during travel moves, so enabling Z-hopping is essential!\nAnother use for this simple technique is to fully incorporate an acrylic sheet within a print by pausing at an appropriate height again, dropping the panel in, and continuing the print. A degree of overlap will lock the panel tight, with the plastic bonding very firmly to the acrylic, as [Julius] demonstrates in the video.\nIts always a delight to see how techniques can combine to create the desired effects. Heres how to use a color laser printer and toner transfer paper to apply designs to a 3D printing front panel. Whilst were thinking about the multitude of uses for hacking with acrylic, what about not doing that and using corrugated plastic instead?\n\n"}

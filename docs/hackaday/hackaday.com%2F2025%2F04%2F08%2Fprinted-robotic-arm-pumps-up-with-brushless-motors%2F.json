Rather than using servos, dARM uses brushless DC (BLDC) motors paired with ODrive S1 controllers. He credits [James Bruton] and [Skyentific] (two names which regular Hackaday readers are likely familiar with) for introducing him to not only the ODrive controllers, but the robotics applications for BLDCs in the first place.\ndARM uses eight ODrive controllers on a CAN bus, which ultimately connect up to a Raspberry Pi 4B with a RS485 CAN Hat. The controllers are connected to each other in a daisy chain using basic twisted pair wire, which simplifies the construction and maintenance of the modular arm.\nAs for the motors themselves, the arm uses three different types depending on where they are located, with three Eaglepower 8308 units for primary actuators, a pair of GB36-2 motors in the forearm, and finally a GM5208-24 for the gripper. Together, [JesseDarr] says the motors and gearboxes are strong enough to lift a 5 pound (2.2 kilogram) payload when extended in a horizontal position.\nThe projects documentation includes assembly instructions for the printed parts, a complete Bill of Materials, and guidance on how to get the software environment setup on the Raspberry Pi. Its not exactly a step-by-step manual, but it looks like theres more than enough information here for anyone whos serious about building a dARM for themselves.\nIf youd like to start off by putting together something a bit easier, weve seen considerably less intimidating robotic arms that you might be interested in.\n\n", "title": "\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cdARM\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0dARM\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002BLDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068ODrive\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cdARM\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "BLDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5f37\u529b\u306aDIY\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u5f0f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u9020", "dARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u7d44\u7acb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

Back in 2014 when NVidia released the GTX 970 users were quickly dismayed to find that their 4 GB VRAM GPU had actually just 3.5 GB, with the remaining 512 MB being used in a much slower way at just 1/7th of the normal speed. Back then NVidia was subject to a $30/card settlement with disgruntled customers, but theres a way to at least partially fix these GPUs, as demonstrated by a group of Brazilian modders (original video with horrid English auto-dub).\nThe mod itself is quite straightforward, with the original 512 MB, 7 Gbps GDDR5 memory modules replaced with 1 GB, 8 Gbps chips and adding a resistor on the PCB to make the GPU recognize the higher density VRAM ICs. Although this doesnt fix the fundamental split VRAM issue of the ASIC, it does give it access to 7 GB of faster, higher-density VRAM. In benchmarks performance was massively increased, with Unigine Superposition showing nearly a doubling in the score.\nIn addition to giving this GTX 970 a new lease on life, it also shows just how important having more VRAM on a GPU is, which is ironic in this era where somehow GPU manufacturers deem 8 GB of VRAM to be acceptable in 2025.\n\n", "title": "- GTX 970\u306eVRAM\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6cd5", "body": "NVIDIA\u306eGTX 970\u306f\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u306f3.5GB\u306eVRAM\u3067\u3001\u6539\u9020\u3067\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- GTX 970\u306eVRAM\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6cd5", "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30b8\u30eb\u306e\u30e2\u30c3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u5b9f\u6f14\uff01GTX 970\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- NVidia\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u5931\u6557\u3068GTX 970\u306e\u6539\u9020\u6210\u529f\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- 512MB\u306eVRAM\u30921GB\u306b\uff01GTX 970\u306e\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- 2025\u5e74\u306b\u8b66\u9418\u3092\u9cf4\u3089\u3059\uff01GPU\u306eVRAM\u5bb9\u91cf\u3068\u305d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

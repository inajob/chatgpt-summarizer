The hardware in question is a variant of the 2013-era Xi3 X7A mini PC, code-named Piston and also known as a Steambox, from back when that was still something that Valve was working on. Although the physical format here is definitely quaint, it might be implementing DisplayPort Dual-Mode (DP++), which was introduced around the same time.\nWith DP++ the DP port can detect when a DVI or HDMI adapter is connected and then transmit DVI/HDMI TMDS signals rather than DP signals. Since DP and HDMI/DVI use a different signaling scheme, normally an active adapter would be required. One disadvantage of DP++ is that the HDMI signal will be limited to e.g. 19201080 @ 120 Hz and 4K only at 30 Hz.\nNormally a DP++ port is marked as such, and requires an adapter that works with the DP++ port. What Xi3 did in this case to make regular DP and HDMI connectors work seems to be somewhat of a mystery, with any information on this type of port being rather scarce. [Jon] thinks he may have found the part itself listed on Mouser, but isnt completely sure.\nFeel free to leave your thoughts and any information you have on this oddity in the comments.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip.", "title": "HDMI\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092DisplayPort\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "HDMI\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092DisplayPort\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u5dee\u3057\u8fbc\u3080\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u305d\u306e\u524d\u63d0\u306b\u6311\u6226\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002Xi3 X7A mini PC\u300cPiston\u300d\u306fDP++\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u3001HDMI\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u901a\u3058\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["HDMI\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092DisplayPort\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u6311\u6226", "2013\u5e74\u306eXi3 X7A mini PC\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u767a\u898b", "DisplayPort Dual-Mode\uff08DP++\uff09\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3068\u5236\u9650", "Xi3\u304cDP++\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u901a\u5e38\u306eDP\u3068HDMI\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u305f\u79d8\u5bc6", "Mouser\u3067\u898b\u3064\u304b\u3063\u305f\u4e0d\u6b63\u898f\u306aDP++\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u60c5\u5831"]}

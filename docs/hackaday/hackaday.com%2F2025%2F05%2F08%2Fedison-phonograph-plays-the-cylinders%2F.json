The Edison Blue Amberol records came out in 1912 and were far superior to the earlier wax cylinders. If you had one today, how could you play it? Easy. Just build [Palingenesis] record player. You can even hear it do its thing in the video below.\nThe cylinders are made of plaster with a celluloid wrapper tinted with the namesake blue color. They were more durable than the old wax records and could hold well over four minutes of sound.\n\nThe player is mostly made from wood cut with a mill or a laser. There are some bearings, fasteners, and  of course  electronics. The stylus requires some care. Conventional records use a lateral-cut groove, but these old records use a vertical-cut. That means the pickup moves up and down and has a rounder tip than a conventional needle.\nRather than try to control the motor to an exact speed, you get to set the speed with a potentiometer and see the resulting RPM on a small display. Overall, an involved but worthwhile project.\nWe recently looked at some players that would have been new about the same time as the blue record in the video. We dont think you could modify one of these to play stereo, but if you do, let us know immediately!\n", "title": "- \u8521\u751f\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "1912\u5e74\u306e\u30a8\u30b8\u30bd\u30f3\u88fd\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30d9\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8521\u751f\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a8\u30b8\u30bd\u30f3\u306e\u9752\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5473\u308f\u3046\uff01\u5782\u76f4\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc"]}

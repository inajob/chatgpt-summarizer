If so, youve likely stumbled at the unassuming zebra strip  the pliable connector that makes bridging PCB pads to glass traces look effortless. [Chuck] recently set out to test if he could hack together his own zebra strip using conductive TPU and a 3D printer.\n[Chuck] started by printing alternating bands of conductive and non-conductive TPU, aiming to mimic the compressible, striped conductor. Despite careful tuning and slow prints, the results were mixed to say the least. The conductive TPU measured a whopping 16 megaohms, barely touching the definition of conductivity! LEDs stayed dark, multimeters sulked, and frustration mounted. Not one to give up, [Chuck] took to his trusty Proto-pasta conductive PLA, and got bright, blinky success. It left no room for flexibility, though.\nIt would appear that conductive TPU still isnt quite ready for prime time in fine-pitch interconnects. But if you find a better filament  or fancy prototyping your own zebra strip  jump in! Wed love to hear about your attempts in the comments.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30bc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff1aTPU\u3067\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "LCD\u306e\u30bc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027TPU\u3067\u306f\u6210\u529f\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30bc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff1aTPU\u3067\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u6750\u6599\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8", "- \u30bc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7d50\u679c", "- \u5c0e\u96fb\u6027TPU\u306e\u9650\u754c\uff1a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u6210\u529f\u306e\u9053\u306e\u308a", "- \u8ae6\u3081\u306a\u3044\u7cbe\u795e\uff01\u30bc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u8a18\u9332"]}

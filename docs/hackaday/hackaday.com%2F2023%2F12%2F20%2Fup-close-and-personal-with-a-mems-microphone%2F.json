The most familiar MEMS device might be the accelerometer that gives your phone a sense of where it is in space; [Zach] has a deep dive into MEMS accelerometers that we covered a while back.\nMEMS microphones seem a little bit easier to understand mechanically, since all they have to do is change vibrations in air into an electrical signal. The microphone that [Zach] tore down for this video is ridiculously small; the SMD device is only about 3 mm long, with the MEMS chip under the can a fraction of a millimeter on a side. After some overall views with the optical microscope, [Zach] opened the can and put the guts under his scanning electron microscope. The SEM shots are pretty amazing, revealing a dimpled silicon diaphragm over a second layer with holes etched right through it. The dimples on the diaphragm nest into the holes, forming an air-dielectric capacitor whose capacitance varies as sound waves vibrate the diaphragm.\nThe most visually interesting feature, though, might be the deep cavity lying behind the two upper surfaces. The cavity, which [Zach] says bears evidence of having been etched by the deep reactive ion etching method, has cool-looking corrugations in its walls. The enormity of the cavity relative to the thin layers covering it suggests its a resonating cavity for the sound waves.\nThanks to [Zach] for this in-depth look at a device thats amazingly complex yet remarkably simple.\n\n", "title": "MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3067\u89e3\u6790\uff01", "body": "$10\u306e\u30a4\u30e4\u30db\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u5256\u3002\u632f\u52d5\u3092\u96fb\u6c17\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3001\u4e2d\u306b\u306f\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u5c64\u306a\u3069\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3067\u89e3\u6790\uff01", "\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u96fb\u6c17\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30d5\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\uff01", "\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u5171\u632f\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u6df1\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u6301\u3064MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

The NEC PC-9800 is a famous example, though almost all the Macintosh computers played either the soothing booting chord or sometimes the Sad Mac error chord. And of course, consoles have long played music on startup, with the original PlayStation boot music heralding a whole new era of video games. But modern machines dont do anything, except maybe a single beep if youre lucky. So why not pop in this M.2 card (JP) and bring some quirky flair to your PC?\nWhile this particular card is aimed at the Japanese market and specifically evokes the PC-9800, we hope to see some hackers creating projects bringing other custom boot sounds to laptops and PCs around the rest of the world! A simple microcontroller, DAC, speaker and flash storage for the waveform would be all thats required. It could even be capacitively coupled into the systems sound output for some extra nerd points. You could pull the ultimate prank and have your friends laptop play the opening notes to Never Gonna Give You Up upon boot. Or you could have your favourite hacker movie quote play  I can trace her physical location by looking at the binary!. Brilliant!\nIn the meantime, if you want one of these cards, youll likely have to use a Japanese mail forwarding service as the cards are only available from Japanese retailer Kadenken  though for only \u00a52880, or just under $20 USD, which is a great deal.\n[via Techspot]"}

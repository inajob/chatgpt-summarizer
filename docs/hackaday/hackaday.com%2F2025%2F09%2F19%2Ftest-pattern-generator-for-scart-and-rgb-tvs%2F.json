When you have a screen starting to go wonky, then you need a way to troubleshoot which is at fault. A great tool for that is a pattern generator, but theyre not the easiest to come by these days. [baritonomarchetto] needed a pattern generator to help repair his favourite arcade machine, and decided to make his own DIY Portable RGB CRT Test Pattern Generator.\nOne of the test patterns available from the device. This TV appears to be in good working order.\nWhile he does cite [Nicholas Murray]s RP2040 test pattern generator as a starting point (which itself builds on the PicoVGA library once featured here), he couldnt just build one. That worthy project only outputs VGA and because [baritonomarchetto] is in Europe, he needed a SCART connector. Since hes working on arcade machines, he needed non-SCART RGB signals, too. The arcade signals need to be at higher voltages (TLL level) than the RGB signal youd find in SCART and VGA.\nThe upshot is while hes using [Nicholas]s code for the RP2040, hes rolled his own PCB, including a different resistor ladders to provide the correct voltages depending on if hes dealing with a home TV or arcade CRT. To make life easier, the whole thing runs off a 9V battery.\nIf youre wondering what the point of these test patterns is, check out this 1981-vintage pattern generator for some context from the era. If a digital replica doesnt float your boat, it is possible to recreate the original analog circuitry that generated these patterns back when the CRT was king."}

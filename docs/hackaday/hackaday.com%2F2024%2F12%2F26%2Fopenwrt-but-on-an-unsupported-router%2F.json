[Hennung Paul] ordered a Wavlink WL-WN586X3 for the princely sum of 39 Euros, but was disappointed to find his device a rev. 2 board rather than the rev.1 board supported by the Linux distribution. Toss it on the failed projects pile and move on? Not at all, he hacked together a working OpenWRT for the device.\nIts fair to say that a majority of Hackaday readers will\u00a0 have familiarity with Linux, but thats something which runs on a sliding scale from Uses Ubuntu a bit all the way to Is at one with the kernel. Wed rate ourselves somewhere around halfway along that scale in terms of having an in-depth knowledge of userland and a working knowledge of some of the internals which make the operating system tick even if were apprehensive about tinkering at that level. [Henning] has no such\u00a0 limitations, and proceeds to take the manufacturers distribution, itself a heavily modified OpenWRT, and make it his own. Booting over tFTP were used to, and were particularly impressed to see him using a Raspberry Pi as a surrogate host for the desoldered Flash chip over SPI.\nIts a long path he takes to get the thing working and were not sure we could follow it all, but we hope that the result will be a new device added to OpenWRTs already extensive support list. Its sometimes a shock to find this distro is now over two decades old.", "title": "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff01OpenWRT\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "39\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304cOpenWRT\u975e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff01OpenWRT\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Wavlink WL-WN586X3\u3067\u306eOpenWRT\u5b9f\u88c5\u8a18", "- \u5931\u6557\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff01Rev.2\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fFlash\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u8853", "- Linux\u3068OpenWRT\u306e\u6df1\u3044\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65c5"]}

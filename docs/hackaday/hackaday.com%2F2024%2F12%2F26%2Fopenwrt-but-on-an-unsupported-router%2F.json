[Hennung Paul] ordered a Wavlink WL-WN586X3 for the princely sum of 39 Euros, but was disappointed to find his device a rev. 2 board rather than the rev.1 board supported by the Linux distribution. Toss it on the failed projects pile and move on? Not at all, he hacked together a working OpenWRT for the device.\nIts fair to say that a majority of Hackaday readers will\u00a0 have familiarity with Linux, but thats something which runs on a sliding scale from Uses Ubuntu a bit all the way to Is at one with the kernel. Wed rate ourselves somewhere around halfway along that scale in terms of having an in-depth knowledge of userland and a working knowledge of some of the internals which make the operating system tick even if were apprehensive about tinkering at that level. [Henning] has no such\u00a0 limitations, and proceeds to take the manufacturers distribution, itself a heavily modified OpenWRT, and make it his own. Booting over tFTP were used to, and were particularly impressed to see him using a Raspberry Pi as a surrogate host for the desoldered Flash chip over SPI.\nIts a long path he takes to get the thing working and were not sure we could follow it all, but we hope that the result will be a new device added to OpenWRTs already extensive support list. Its sometimes a shock to find this distro is now over two decades old."}

You can build a keyboard using spoons, as demonstrated by [JCo Audio].\u00a0\nThe build relies on twelve metal spoons to act as the keys of the instrument. Theyre assembled into a wooden base in a manner roughly approximating the white and black keys of a conventional piano keyboard, using 3D-printed inserts to hold them in place. Theyre hooked up to a Raspberry Pi Pico via a Pico Touch 2 board, which allows the spoons to be used as capacitive touch pads. Code from [todbot] was then used to take input from the 12 spoons and turn it into MIDI data. From there, hooking the Pi Pico up to a PC running some kind of MIDI synth is enough to make sounds.\nIts a simple build, but a functional one. Plus, it lets you ask your friends if theyd like to hear you play the spoons. The key here is to make a big show of hooking your instrument up to a laptop while explaining youre not going to play the spoons a la the folk instrument, but youre going to play a synth instead. Then you should use the spoon keyboard to play emulated spoon samples anyway. Its called doubling down.\u00a0Video after the break.\n\n"}

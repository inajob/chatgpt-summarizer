You can build a keyboard using spoons, as demonstrated by [JCo Audio].\u00a0\nThe build relies on twelve metal spoons to act as the keys of the instrument. Theyre assembled into a wooden base in a manner roughly approximating the white and black keys of a conventional piano keyboard, using 3D-printed inserts to hold them in place. Theyre hooked up to a Raspberry Pi Pico via a Pico Touch 2 board, which allows the spoons to be used as capacitive touch pads. Code from [todbot] was then used to take input from the 12 spoons and turn it into MIDI data. From there, hooking the Pi Pico up to a PC running some kind of MIDI synth is enough to make sounds.\nIts a simple build, but a functional one. Plus, it lets you ask your friends if theyd like to hear you play the spoons. The key here is to make a big show of hooking your instrument up to a laptop while explaining youre not going to play the spoons a la the folk instrument, but youre going to play a synth instead. Then you should use the spoon keyboard to play emulated spoon samples anyway. Its called doubling down.\u00a0Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u697d\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "body": "\u8c61\u7259\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u300212\u672c\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u97f3\u697d\u697d\u5668\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u3001Raspberry Pi Pico\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u3001MIDI\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u697d\u5668\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u697d\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "\u8c61\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff1a\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u5668\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u697d\u5668\u4f5c\u308a\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684", "PC\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3066\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff1a\u30b9\u30d7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

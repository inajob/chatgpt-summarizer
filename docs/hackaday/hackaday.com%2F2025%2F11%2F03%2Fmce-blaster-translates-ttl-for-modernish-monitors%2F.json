How about the older standards like EGA, CGA, or MDA? Well, its good luck on eBay or at the recycling yard to get a period-appropriate monitor, but the bulky, fragile CRTs seem to have been less likely to survive than computers that drove them. Thats what [Scrap Computer]s MCE Blaster is for: it sits betwixt the retrocomputers TTL output and the VGA input of a (more) modern monitor, be it CRT or LCD.\n\nTaking the TTL input and spitting out a properly-formatted VGA signal isnt trivial, but with a Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico2) sitting in the middle, theres plenty of horsepower to act as a translator. Theres a certain irony in having a video dongle with more horsepower than your whole machine, but thats the price of progress, perhaps. This project is cheaper and simpler to implement than others that connect to upscalers.\nMCEBlaster is now on rev 0.3, which aside from adding compatibility with the Pi Pico, also allows a TLL offset. The older versions had a problem where it was possible to perfectly synchronize the sampling rate of the Pi Pico with the TLL signal from the computers graphics adapter but during the crossover period between pulses, which wasnt exactly ideal. The offset allows for that. There are also trim pots to manually adjust the R, G, and B channels. This has the fun result of allowing you to turn down the R and B channels so you can pretend your CRT has a green phosphor, or dial down the G to get a homey amber glow. It also lets you correct the brightness, if things are looking a little dim or overblown.\nThe whole thing is open source on GitHub, with an active development community. Weve embedded the rev.0.3 release video below so you can see how it works and how well it works.\nOf course, CGA and EGA werent the only options back in the day, and we covered some of the competition before. Thanks to the open-source nature of this project, MCE Blaster may support some of them someday, too.\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff01MCE Blaster\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "MCE Blaster\u306f\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306eTTL\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092VGA\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6551\u3046\uff01MCE Blaster\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fVGA\u4fe1\u53f7\u5909\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aMCE Blaster\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "- RGB\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u8abf\u6574\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u304a\u597d\u307f\u306e\u753b\u9762\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff01"]}

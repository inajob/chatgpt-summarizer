Thats great content if youre into it, but not exactly fodder for Hackaday  with one exception. [Gamers Nexus] gives us a half hour of relatively-unedited footage of them just chatting with the engineers behind the hardware.\nIts great stuff right from the get-go: they start with how thermal management drove the PCB design, and put the SoC on the back of the chip, sandwiched betwixt heat pipes. We dont usually think of taking heat through the PCB when building a board, so its a neat detail to learn about before these things get into the hands of the usual suspects who will doubtless give us teardown videos in a few months.\nFrom there wanders to power delivery  getting the voltage regulators packaged properly was a challenge, since impedance requirements meant a very tight layout. Anyone who has worked on this kind of SBC might be familiar with that issue, but for those looking in from the outside, its a fascinating glimpse at electrical sausage being made. Thats just the first half.\nThe heat-regulation conversation is partially repeated the next conversation (which seems to have happened first) where they get into the cooling requirements of the LCD screens. This requires less than you might think, as they like to run warm for fast refresh. Its really more about keeping your face cool. They also they discuss acoustic vibration  you dont want your integrated audio shaking your IMUs apart  and why the prototype was being blasted with freakin laser beams to monitor it.\nIf you havent seen or read any other coverage on the Steam Frame, youre going to miss some context here, but if youve not hid under a rock for that announcement, this is amazing detail to have. Were hugely impressed that Valve let their engineers out of their cubicle-cave to talk to media.\nSure, its not an open-source VR headset, but compared to the deafening silence coming from the likes of Meta, this level of information is still awesome to have.\n\n"}

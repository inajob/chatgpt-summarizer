Rather than the boot process going from real-mode 16-bit to protected mode, and from 32- to 64-bit mode, the system would boot straight into the 64-bit mode which Intel figures is what everyone uses anyway.\nWhere things get a bit hazy is that on this theoretical X86-S you cannot just install and boot your current 64-bit operating systems, as they have no concept of this new boot procedure, or the other low-level features that got dropped. This is where the Itanium comparison seems most apt, as it was Intels attempt at a clean cut with its x86 legacy, only for literally everything about the concept (VLIW) and legacy software support to go horribly wrong.\nAlthough X86-S seems much less ambitious than Itanium, it would nevertheless be interesting to hear AMDs thoughts on the matter."}

It wound up costing $25 to create a wireless board with no custom PCB required. Each half has its own microcontroller, and the whole thing connects via Bluetooth. While we dont mind making a PCB, we can appreciate that you could change your mind easily with this wiring scheme.\nThe 3D printed case holds the keys, and then it is just a matter of carefully soldering the keys to the microcontrollers. Of course, each side also has to have its own battery. The ZMK firmware is split in half, one part for each side of the keyboard. The nRF52840 CPUs have plenty of wireless connectivity. The keys are set in rows and columns, so the amount of soldering back to the controller is manageable.\nWhile we applaud the wireless design, it does seem odd that you have to charge both halves and turn them on and off separately. But thats the nice thing about a design like this  you could modify the design to not have a split. Or, you could allow one flexible wire pair to run across for power. Of course, you could modify the layout, including adding or deleting keys.\nYou might consider adding a pointing device. At least you dont have to pull out a saw.\n\n"}

The ring that [Aaron Christophel] got his mittens on is the SR08, which appears to have been cloned by many manufacturers at this point. Its got an OLED display,\u00a01 MB Flash and a Renesas DA14585 powering it from a positively adorable 16 mAh LiPo battery.\nThe small scale makes it an absolute chore to reverse-engineer and develop with, which is why [Aaron] got the \u20ac35 DA14585 development kit from Renesas. Since this dev kit only comes with a 256 kB SPI Flash chip, he had to replace it with a 1 MB one. The reference PDFs, pinouts and custom demo firmware are provided on his GitHub account, all of which is also explained in the video.\nRather than hack the ring and destroy it like his first attempts, [Aaron] switched to using the Renesas Software Update OTA app to flash custom firmware instead. A CRC error is shown, but this can be safely ignored. The ring uses about 18 \u00b5A idle and 3 mA while driving the display, which is covered in the provided custom firmware for anyone who wants to try doing something interesting with these rings.\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aSR08\u306e\u6982\u8981\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0SR08\u306e\u958b\u767a\u6cd5\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aSR08\u306e\u6982\u8981\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1aSR08\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "Renesas DA14585\u958b\u767a\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067SR08\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806", "SR08\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

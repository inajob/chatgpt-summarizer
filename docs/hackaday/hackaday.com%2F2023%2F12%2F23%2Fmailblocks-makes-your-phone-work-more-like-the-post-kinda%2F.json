[Guy Dupont] wishes to be no slave to the machine, and thus built a solution. Enter Mailblocks.\nThe concept is simple. Its a physical mailbox which [Guy] can put his phone in. All notifications on the phone are blocked unless he puts his phone into the box. When the phone is inside and the box is closed, the little red flag goes up, indicating DOPAMINE is available, and [Guy] can check his notifications.\nTo achieve this, [Guy] is running a custom DNS server. It redirects all the lookups for push notifications on Android so they go nowhere. Placing the phone in the mailbox turns the re-directions off, so the phone can contact the usual servers and get its notifications as normal.\nIts a novel way of fighting against the constant attention suck of modern smartphones. Rather than being bombarded by notifications in real time, [Guy] instead has to take a significant intentional physical action to check the notifications. It cuts the willpower required and the interruptions to his work in a fell swoop.\nWeve featured [Guys] innovative and outside-the-box projects before, too. His smart pants were an absolute tour de force, I might add.\n\n"}

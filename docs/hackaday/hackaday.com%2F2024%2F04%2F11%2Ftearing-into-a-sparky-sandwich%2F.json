[Eds Garage] was able to source a Spark EV battery pack that had succumbed to a single bad cell and takes us along for the disassembly of the faulty module.\nThe Spark EV was the predecessor to the more well-known Chevy Bolt, so its nearly ten year old systems might not reflect the state-of-the-art in EV batteries, but they are certainly more modern than the battery in your great-grandmothers Baker Electric. The Li-ion polymer pouch cells are sandwiched together with cooling and shock absorbing panels to keep the cells healthy and happy, at least in theory.\nIn a previous video, [Eds Garage] takes apart the full pack and shows how the last 2P16S module has assumed a darker color on its yellow plastic, seeming to indicate that it wasnt receiving sufficient cooling during its life in the car. It would seem that the cooling plates inside the module werent quite up to the task. These cells are destined for other projects, but it doesnt seem like this particular type of battery module would be too difficult to reassemble and put back in a car as long as you could get the right torque settings for the compression bolts.\nIf youre looking for other EV teardowns, might we suggest this Tesla Model S pack or one from a passively-cooled Nissan Leaf?\n\n", "title": "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\uff1aSpark EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5206\u89e3", "body": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eEV\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306f\u307e\u3060\u767a\u5c55\u9014\u4e2d\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9ad8\u5727\u8a13\u7df4\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4e0d\u8db3\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4e9b\u7d30\u306a\u554f\u984c\u304c\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u5168\u4f53\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Eds Garage\u306f\u3001Spark EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3057\u3001\u4e0d\u826f\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3088\u308a\u53e4\u3044\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\uff1aSpark EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5206\u89e3", "Spark EV\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u554f\u984c", "EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\uff1a\u518d\u7d44\u7acb\u3078\u306e\u9053", "\u73fe\u4ee3EV\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5", "EV\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5206\u89e3\uff1aTesla Model S\u3084Nissan Leaf\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

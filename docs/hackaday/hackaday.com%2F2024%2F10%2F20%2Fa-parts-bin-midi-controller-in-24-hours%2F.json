Sure, standard instruments like pianos and drums can be interfaced with a computer fairly easily using this standard, but essentially anything can be converted to a MIDI instrument with the right wiring and a little bit of coding. [Jeremy] needed to build a MIDI controller in a single day, and with just a few off-the-shelf parts he was able to piece together a musical instrument from his parts bin.\nThe build is housed in an off-brand protective case from a favorite American discount tool store, but the more unique part of the project is the choice to use arcade buttons as the instruments inputs. [Jeremy] tied eight of these buttons to an Arduino Uno to provide a full octaves worth of notes, and before you jump to the comments to explain that there are 12 notes in an octave, he also added a button to the side of the case to bend any note when pressed simultaneously. An emergency stop button serves as a master on/off switch and a MIDI dongle on the other side serves as the interface point to a computer.\nAfter a slight bit of debugging, the interface is up and running within [Jeremy]s required 24-hour window. Hes eventually planning to use it to control a custom MIDI-enabled drum kit, but for now it was fun to play around with it in some other ways. Hes also posted the project code on a GitHub page. And, if this looks a bit familiar, this was not [Jeremy]s first MIDI project. He was also the creator of one of the smallest MIDI interfaces weve ever seen.\n\n", "title": "1\u65e5\u3067\u4f5c\u308bMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "body": "MIDI\u306f\u97f3\u697d\u754c\u3067\u6a19\u6e96\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6b8b\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u7406\u7531\u306e1\u3064\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u6c4e\u7528\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002 [Jeremy] \u306f\u308f\u305a\u304b1\u65e5\u3067MIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u697d\u5668\u306e\u5165\u529b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u53cd\u5fdc\u6027\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306e\u3053\u306e\u697d\u5668\u306f\u3044\u3064\u304b\u72ec\u81ea\u306eMIDI\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1\u65e5\u3067\u4f5c\u308bMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u5668\u3092\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308b", "24\u6642\u9593\u3067\u5b8c\u6210\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aMIDI\u697d\u5668", "MIDI\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u5fa1\u7528\u306b\u958b\u767a", "GitHub\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u516c\u958b"]}

Less likely still would have been the idea that Hackaday would honor him with the 2025 One-Hertz Challenge.\nThe challenge was deliberately  dare we say, fiendishly?  simple: Do something, anything, but do it once a second. Flash a light, ring a bell, click a relay, or even spam comments on a website other than Hackaday; anything at all, but do it at as close to one Hertz as possible. These are our favorite kinds of contests, because the simplicity affords a huge canvas for the creative mind to paint upon while still providing an interesting technical constraint thats just difficult enough to make things spicy.\nAnd boy, did you respond! Weve received over a hundred entries since we announced the contest back in June, meaning that many of you spent 4,662,000 seconds of your summer (at least those of you above the equator) rising to the challenge. The time was well spent, with projects that pushed the limits of what we even expected.\nWhile we loved em all, we had to winnow them down to the top three, each of which receives a $150 gift certificate from our sponsor, DigiKey. Lets take a look at them, along with our favorite runners-up.\n\nOur Top Three\nAt the top of our judges list was the electromechanicalanalogdigitalclock, a project that clearly didnt know what it wanted to be but nevertheless did it with a lot of style. [Christian]s contraption pushes a lot of design buttons, starting with the mains-powered stepper motor generating a 1-Hz signal with a photochopper, which drives a 12-bit counter made from some CMOS logic chips and a digital-to-analog converter that drives some vintage moving-coil meters to display the time. Theres even a bit of circuit sculpture thrown in, with a brass frame supporting and isolating the noisy stepper motor on a spring suspension. Extra points were no doubt earned thanks to the Space:1999 and Star Trek models in the photos.\nThe electromechanicalanalogdigitalclock by [Christian].BEZICRON was inspired by [ekaggrat singh kalsi] playing with his daughters springy hair ties.Next up we have BEZICRON by [ekaggarat singh kalsi]. If this one looks familiar, its probably because we featured it back in January, when we had a difficult time describing exactly what this is. Its a clock, sure, but its display is vastly different from anything weve ever seen before, based as it is on hair bands, of all things, that are bent and stretched into numerals by a series of intricate cams and levers. The idea is unique, the mechanism is complex, the design is striking, and the sinuous 1-Hz pulse of the colon is mesmerizing.\nOur final gift certificate goes to [Tim], who managed to use candle flames as a time base. Youve probably noticed candles guttering and flickering thanks to uneven wax melting or even drafts blowing the flame column around and thought they were fairly random. But [Tim] noticed that these oscillations were actually more stable and predictable than they appear, and used a wire sticking into the flame to trigger the capacitive sensor input on a CH32xxx microcontroller to measure the frequency, which was then divided down to flash an LED at 1-Hz. Its the perfect combination of physics and electronics that extracts order from a seemingly stochastic in a weird and wonderful way.\nAwesome Honorable Mentions\nWhats always fun about Hackaday contests is the categories we come up with, which are sort of mini-games within the main challenge. And this time around didnt disappoint, with projects that explored these side quests in fun and interesting ways.\nOur Ridiculous category was all about tapping your inner Rube Goldberg and finding the least practical way to generate your 1-pps pulse train. Runners-up in this category included [Brian Stuparyk]s electromechanical function generator, a pitchblende-powered atomic clock by [alnwlsn], and [Sean B]s Nothing but NAND Nixie clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Timelords category, we were looking for the projects that pulled out all the stops to get as many zeroes as possible after the decimal point, and the entries didnt disappoint. Check out this vintage atomic clock restoration by [CuriousMarc] and his merry band, [Lauri Pirttiaho]s cheap and simple GPS sync for quartz wall clocks, or this GPS-disciplined crystal-oven oscillator by [Will Carver].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horologically inclined were the target audience for the Clockwork category, which invited you to turn your one-per-second timebase into a unique and interesting timepiece. See [Simon Newhouse]s Nixie-based frequency counter clock, the DCF77 clock [hayday] made from the 2022 Supercon Badge, or the beautiful bubble displays of [Andrew Tudoroi]s RPi TinynumberHat9 clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, what would a One-Hertz challenge be without the venerable 555 timer chip? Entries we liked from the Coulda Used a 555 category include [Tom Goff]s Bletchley-inspired Logic Bombe, this mind-bending, capacitor-free timer that [Mark Valentine] put together, and [Paul Gallagher]s super annoying One Hurts clock  its worse than a cuckoo clock!\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryones a Winner!\nWed love to give everyone a prize, but wed be hard-pressed to manage that with so many cool and unusual projects. As they say, everyones a winner just for entering, and we think thats especially true with contests like this, which bring out the best in everyone. Thanks to everyone who entered, the judges for sorting through everything and making the hard choices, and to our sponsor DigiKey.

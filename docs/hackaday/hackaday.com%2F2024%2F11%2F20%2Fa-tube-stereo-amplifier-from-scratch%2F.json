Nevertheless, building one is still a challenge, as [Mike Freda shows us with a stereo amplifier in the video below the break.\nThe tubes in question are the 12AU7 double triode and 6L6 tetrode, in this case brand new PSVANE parts from China. The design is a very conventional single-ended class A circuit, with both side of the double triode being used for extra gain driving the tetrode. The output uses a tapped transformer with the tap going to the other grid in the tertode, something we dimly remember as being an ultra-linear circuit.\nTheres an element of workshop entertainment in the video, but aside from that we think its the process of characterising the amp and getting its voltages right which is the take-away here. Its not something many of us do these days, so despite the apparent simplicity of the circuit its worth a look.\nThese modern tubes come from a variety of different sources, weve attempted to track them down in the past.\n\n"}

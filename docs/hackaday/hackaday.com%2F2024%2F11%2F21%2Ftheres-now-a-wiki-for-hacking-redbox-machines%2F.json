The site also has breakdowns on individual components. For example, it covers the computers inside the machines, built by Dell, Lenovo, and Premio, and bits and pieces like the DVD carousel and the modems used inside.\nBasically, if youre working with these machines and you dont have a manual, this resource could help you out.\u00a0 As could the neat video below that shows the internals of a Redbox machine during the reloading process.\nWhatever you do, though, dont steal the kiosks. Theres folks handling that already, youre not allowed to just walk up and haul them away. Check out our earlier coverage of people that are still out there renting from these machines, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u96c6\u7d04\u3057\u305f\u300cUnredbox Wiki\u300d", "body": "Redbox\u306e\u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308bWiki\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3084\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u96c6\u7d04\u3057\u305f\u300cUnredbox Wiki\u300d", "- \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ea\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\uff1aPC\u3084DVD\u30ab\u30e9\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "- DIY\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u306e\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u3057\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u3092\u76d7\u307e\u306a\u3044\u3067\uff01\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6cc1\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

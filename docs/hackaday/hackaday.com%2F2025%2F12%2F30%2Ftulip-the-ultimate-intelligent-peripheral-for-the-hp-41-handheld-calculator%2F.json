These particular calculators support Reverse Polish notation which seems to be one of those things, like the Dvorak keyboard, where once you get used to it you can never go back.\n\nIn doing the research for this article we came across the fan site hpcalc.org which has been online since 1997, although the Way Back Machine can only go back to late 1998. Still, we were impressed. Its fun that the site still looks very much like it did 28 years ago!\nThe TULIP4041 is based around the RP2350 microcontroller which you might know as the heart of a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board. The video below the break is a talk about the present and future of the TULIP project, and the slides are here: TULIP4041  The Next Chapter.pdf (PDF).\nThanks to [Andrew] for writing in.

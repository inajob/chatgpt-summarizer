Some of them are better than others, but this one from [John Graham-Cumming] is definitely a rubbish clock. It performs the simple yet vital task of keeping track of which day is which when it comes to trash collection.\nThe big revelation for us from this project is that the standard plastic battery clock mechanism which youll\u00a0 no doubt be familiar with from many cheap clocks can also be bought with gearing for a weekly rather than daily revolution. The physical hack is therefore a pretty simple one of mounting the movement with a single hand over a face showing the waste collections, and the write-up goes into more depth about the code for creating custom SVG clock faces. Were already thinking of interesting stuff that can be done with one of these movements.\nMeanwhile, we like this clock, but its certainly not the first trash indicator weve seen."}

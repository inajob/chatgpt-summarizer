Finding use in applications such as keeping single-board computers ticking along in the case of a power failure, they would seem to be a panacea. Unfortunately most of these boards come with a series of fatal flaws, such as those that [MisterHW] found in an LX-2BUPS board obtained from AliExpress. Worst of all was the deep discharge of the Li-ion cells to below 2 V, which took some ingenuity and hard work to fix this and other problems.\nThe patched up XR2981 boost IC with MCP809 reset IC installed. (Credit: [MisterHW])This particular board is rated for 5V at 3A, featuring the all too common TP4056 as charging IC and the XYSemi XR2981 boost converter. Since there is no off-switch or other protections on the board, the XR2981 will happily keep operating until around 2.6V, at a rather astoundingly high idle power consumption. Because of this the fixes mostly concentrated on optimizing the XR2981, by using better resistor values (R7, R8, R9), as well as adding a 3.15V MCP809 reset IC, to reduce idle power usage of the boost converter and disable it below a safe cell voltage.\nThe final coup de gr\u00e2ce was the eviction of the red LED (D6) and replacing it with the blue LED from D2, to stop the former from draining the cell as well. With these changes in place, no-load power usage dropped from nearly 900 \u00b5A to just over 200 \u00b5A, while preventing deep discharge. Although this board now has a second life, it does raise the question of what the point of these cheap UPS boards is if you have to spend money and time on reworking them before theyre somewhat acceptable. What is your go-to solution for these boards?", "title": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aUPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6539\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u5ec9\u4fa1\u306aUPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304cLi-ion\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u6025\u5897\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u6b20\u9665\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u7279\u306b\u6df1\u653e\u96fb\u304c\u6700\u5927\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3002\u4fee\u5fa9\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3084\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u6df1\u653e\u96fb\u9632\u6b62\u7b56\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8IC\u3084LED\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u7121\u8ca0\u8377\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u524a\u6e1b\u3002\u4fee\u5fa9\u5f8c\u3082\u6295\u8cc7\u3068\u6642\u9593\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u7591\u554f\u304c\u6b8b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aUPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6539\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5", "Li-ion\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f7f\u3046UPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u4fee\u6b63\u3067UPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u6df1\u653e\u96fb\u3092\u9632\u3050\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aUPS\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3068\u8ab2\u984c"]}

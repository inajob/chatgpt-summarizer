Found for about $5, this unit uses simple components yet achieves surprisingly sophisticated behaviors. Its self-latching feature and decisive illumination shut-off are just the beginning. A detailed analysis by [BigCliveDotCom] reveals a smart circuit that defies its humble price.\nThe circuit operates via a capacitive dropper, a cost-effective way to power low-current devices. What stands out, though, is its self-latching behavior. During a power failure, transistors manage to keep the LEDs illuminated until the battery voltage drops below a precise threshold, avoiding the dreaded fade-to-black. Equally clever is the automatic shut-off when the voltage dips too low, sparing the battery from a full drain.\nModifications are possible, too. For regions with 220V+ mains, swapping the dropper capacitor with a 470nF one can reduce heat dissipation. Replacing the discharge resistor (220k) with a higher value improves longevity by running cooler. What remarkable reverse engineering marvels have you come across? Share it in the comments!\u00a0 After all, it is fun to hack into consumer stuff. Even if it is just a software hack.\n\n", "title": "- \u683c\u5b89LED\u975e\u5e38\u706f\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aAliExpress\u306e\u975e\u5e38\u706f\u306f\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002\u81ea\u52d5\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u3084\u96fb\u5727\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u512a\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6539\u9020\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u683c\u5b89LED\u975e\u5e38\u706f\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u81ea\u5df1\u4fdd\u6301\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u56de\u8def\u306e\u89e3\u6790", "- \u96fb\u6e90\u969c\u5bb3\u6642\u306eLED\u7167\u660e\u7dad\u6301\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6539\u9020\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u63d0\u6848", "- \u6d88\u8cbb\u8ca1\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

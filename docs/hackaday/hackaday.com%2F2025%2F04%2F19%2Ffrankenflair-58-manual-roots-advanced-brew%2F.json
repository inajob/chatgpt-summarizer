[Janne] from Fraktal thinks so, he has an espresso machine he enjoys but the default controls were not what he was looking for and so in true hacker fashion he took what was and made it his own.\n\nThis Kickstarter-born Flair 58 is a manual espresso machine with minimal moving parts and no electronics in its default configuration. An optional preheater was available, but it felt like an afterthought. He decided to add a bit more finesse into his solution, with a sleek touchscreen display controlling a custom heater board with closed-loop temperature control, and provisions to connect an external scale scale for precise pour measurements. Weve seen coffee maker hacks before, but this one certainly stands out for adding features absent from the machine\u2019s initial design.\nTo accommodate the two custom PCBs and the touchscreen, [Janne] modified the machine\u2019s frame. The Flair 58\u2019s swooping curves posed a challenge, but instead of using an external enclosure, he shaped the PCBs to fit seamlessly within the machine\u2019s structure. A wonderfully done hack given the open, exposed design of the base hardware.\nCertainly head over to his site and check out this beautiful solution to improving on an existing device, and check out his other cool project based around laser fault injection. All the hardware and software for this project is freely available over on his site so if youd like to upgrade your machine be sure to go check it out.", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aFlair 58\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u4e8b\u4f8b", "body": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30a8\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30bd\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u6539\u9020\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3002\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u8ffd\u52a0\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aFlair 58\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30a8\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30bd\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u826f", "- \u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u4f5c\u308a\u3092\u9032\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff01Janne\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- Flair 58\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3066\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u6e29\u5ea6\u5236\u5fa1", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30bd\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

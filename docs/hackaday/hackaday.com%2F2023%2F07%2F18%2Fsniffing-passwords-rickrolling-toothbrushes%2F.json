Of course there\u2019s no question: you\u2019d never give up, or let down. Or at least that\u2019s what [Aaron Christophel] did. (Videos, embedded below.)\nBut that\u2019s just the victory lap. The race began with previous work by [Cyrill K\u00fcnzi], who figured out that the NFC chip inside was used for a run-time counter, and managed to reset it by sniffing the password with an SDR as it was being transmitted. A great hack to be sure, but it only works for people with their own SDR setup.\nWith the goal of popularizing toothbrush-head-NFC-hacking, [Aaron] busted open the toothbrush itself, found the debug pins, dumped the flash, and got to reverse engineering. A pass through Ghidra got him to where the toothbrush reads the NFC tag ID from the toothbrush head. But how does it get from the ID to the password? It turns out that it runs a CRC on a device UID from the NFC tag itself and also a manufacturer\u2019s string found in the NFC memory, and scramble-combines the two CRC values.\nSounds complicated, but the NFC UID can be read with a cellphone app, and the manufacturer\u2019s string is also printed right on the toothbrush head itself for your convenience. Armed with these two numbers, you can calculate the password, and convince your toothbrush head that it\u2019s brand new, all from the comfort of your smartphone! Isn\u2019t technology grand?\nWe\u2019re left guessing a little bit about the Rickroll hack, but we\u2019d guess that once [Aaron] had the debug pins on the toothbrush\u2019s microcontroller, he just couldn\u2019t resist writing and flashing in a custom firmware. Talk about dedication.\n[Aaron] has been doing extensive work on e-paper displays, but his recent work on the Sumup payment terminal is a sweet look at hacking into higher security devices with acupuncture needles.\n\n\n"}

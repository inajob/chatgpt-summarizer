If youre looking for a unique way of heating your workshop this year, you could do worse than build an 8-bit computer with a bunch of 6N3P vacuum tubes. While there are some technical details, you might find it a challenging build. But it is still an impressive sight, and it took 18 months to build a prototype and the final version. You can find the technical details if you want to try your hand. Oh, did we mention it takes about 200 amps? One of the prototype computers plays Pong on a decidedly low-tech display, which you can see below.\nThe architecture has 8 data bits and 12 address bits. It only provides six instructions, but that keeps the tube count manageable. Each tube has two triodes in one envelope and form a NOR gate which is sufficient to build everything else you need. In addition to tubes, there are reed relays and some NVRAM, a modern conceit.\nOperating instructions are to turn it on and wait for the 560 tubes to warm up. Then, to quote the designer,  I check the fire extinguisher is full, and run the code. We wonder if one of the six instructions is halt and catch fire. Another quote from the builder is: It has been a ridiculous amount of soldering and a fantastic amount of fun. We can imagine.\nIf the computer seems familiar, we covered the first and second prototypes named ENA and Fred. Weve also seen tube-base single-board computers.\n\n"}

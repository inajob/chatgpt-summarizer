The idea here is to have a full-keyboard development board for learning programming languages like CircuitPython, MicroPython, C++, and so on, wherever [MakerM0] happens to be at a given moment.\nOpen up the LangCard and youll find an RP2040 and a slim LiPo battery. Im not sure what display that is, but there are probably a few that would work just fine were you to make one of these fun learning devices for yourself.\n\nCalling All Tiny Keyboard Makers!\nImage by [sporewoh] via KBDIt seems that [sporewoh], who has been featured here before for building magnificent tiny keyboards, is holding a tiny keyboard design contest, which is being sponsored by PCBWay.\nAll the rules and such are available over on GitHub. Basically, you need to create a new design, publish the open-source design somewhere along with the source files, and, ideally, build a functional prototype. Entries are made official by sharing in the appropriate channel of [sporewoh]s Discord.\nEntries will be scored on novelty and innovation, size/portability, viability, reproducibility, and presentation. Submissions arent due until September 10th, so you have a bit of time to really think about what youre going to do. The prizes include PCBWay credits as well as kits designed by [sporewoh]. How small can you go and still be able to type at least 20 WPM? Thats a requirement, by the way.\nThe Centerfold: Its a Tasty Snacks Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThats right; weve got a gallery this time. I simply couldnt decide which picture best conveyed the deliciousness of this thing. I mean, the first shot is a good thought, but you really dont get right away that its a Ring Pop knob, and thats vitally important information.\nAnyway, this is a Le Chiffre that has been quite smoothly 3D-printed in marble filament. [CattiDaddi] says they got that by using a matte print bed. I wish I knew what keycaps those are, because that is a sneaky typeface they have going.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Forgotten History of Chinese Keyboards\nThe IPX keyboard. Image via IEEE Spectrum\nHere is quite an interesting bit of history as it relates to Chinas ability to survive the ravages of time, which pivots on their use of character-based script.\nThe story begins with a talk that took place decades ago, and follows the path of one audience member who came to change the course of Chinese keyboard history  a Taiwanese cadet named Chan-hui Yeh.\nAfter graduating with a B.S. in electrical engineering, Yeh went on to earn an M.S. in nuclear engineering and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He then joined IBM, although it wasnt to revolutionize Chinese text technologies; he was helping to develop computational simulations for large-scale manufacturing plants. But the talk stuck with him.\nYeh eventually quit his job and developed the IPX keyboard, which had 160 main keys with 15 characters each. A daughter keyboard was used to choose the character on a given key, and there were nearly 120 levels of Shift to change all the 160 keys character assignments.\nSee that picture with the spiral-bound book? The 160 keys are underneath the book, and the user presses the pages to access the pressure pads beneath. The booklets had up to eight pages, each with 2,400 characters. The total number of potential symbols was just under 20,000.\nThe IPX keyboard is just the first of three interesting inputs described within this history. You owe it to yourself to devote time to reading this one.\nThanks to [juju] for sending this in!\nICYMI: One-Handed Keyboard Does It Without Chording\nImage by [Dylan Turner] via Hackaday.IOUsually when we talk about operating an entire keyboard with one hand and leaving the other free for mousing or holding a beer, chording  pressing multiple keys at once like on a piano  is very much on the table. Keyboards like the Infogrip BAT come to mind.\nBut that isnt always the case. Take for example the one-handed PCD Maltron, which I think must have inspired [Dylan Turner]s one-handed keyboard.\n[Dylan]s design puts 75 keys in close reach of one hands worth of fingers, and doesnt let the thumb off easy like on a standard keyboard. All the Function keys are\u00a0 there, and the arrow keys are in a familiar layout. There is even an Insert/Delete cluster. Everything is up on GitHub if you want to make your own.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

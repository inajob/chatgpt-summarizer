Thats what [Chris Borges] decided when he put together this rock-solid, concrete-filled CNC milling machine.\nThe concrete body of this machine is housed inside a 3D printed shell, which makes for an attractive skin as well as a handy mold. Within the concrete is a steel skeleton, with the rebar being made of threaded rods and a length of square tubing to hold the main column. You can see the concrete being poured in around the rebar in the image, or watch it happen in the build video embedded below.\nIn goes the concrete, up goes the rigidity.All three axes slide on linear rails, and are attached to lead screws driven by the omnipresent NEMA 17 steppers. The air-cooled spindle, apparently the weak-point of the design, is attached to a pivoting counterweight, but make no mistake: it is on rails. All-in-all, it looks like a very rigid, and very capable design  [Chris] shows it cutting through aluminum quite nicely.\nGiven that [Chris] has apparently never used a true mill before, this design came out remarkably well. Between the Bill of Materials and 45 page step-by-step assembly instructions, hes also done a fantastic job documenting the build for anyone who wants to put one together for themselves.\nThis isnt the first concrete-filled project weve highlighted from [Chris], you may remember seeing his lathe on these pages. It certainly isnt the first CNC mill weve covered, either.\n\n"}

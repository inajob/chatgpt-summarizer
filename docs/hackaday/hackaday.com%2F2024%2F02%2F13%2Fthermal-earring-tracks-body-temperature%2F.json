Well, what if you cant or dont want to adorn yourself this way? Then theres the thermal earring.\nDeveloped at the University of Washington, the thermal earring is quite small and unobtrusive compared to a smartwatch. Sure, it dangles, but thats so it can measure ambient temperature for comparisons sake.\nYou dont even need to have pierced ears\u00a0  the earring attaches to the lobe magnetically. And yeah, the earring can be decorated to hide the circuitry, but you know we would rock the bare boards.\nThe earring uses BLE to transmit readings throughout the day, and of course goes into sleep mode between transmissions to save power. Coincidentally, it runs for 28 days per charge, which is the length of the average menstrual cycle. While the earring at this time merely shows promise as a means of monitoring stress and ovulation, it did outperform a smartwatch at measuring skin temperature while the wearers were at rest.\nThis is definitely not the only pair of earrings weve got around here. These art deco earrings use flexible PCBs, and this pair will light up the night."}

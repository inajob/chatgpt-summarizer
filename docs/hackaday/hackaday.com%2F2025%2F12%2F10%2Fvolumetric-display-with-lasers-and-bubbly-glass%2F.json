Some people call them bubblegrams. While it could be argued that bubblegrams are a sort of 3D display, theyre more like a photograph than a TV. [Ancient] had the brainwave that since these objects work by scattering light, he could use them as a proper 3D video display by controlling the light scattered from an appropriately-designed bubblegram.\nAppropriately designed, in this case, means a point cloud, which is not exactly exciting to look at on its own. Its when [Ancient] adds the colour laser scanning projector that things get exciting. Well, after some very careful alignment. We imagine if this was to go on to become more than a demonstrator some sort of machine-vision auto-aligning would be desirable, but [Ancient] is able to conquer three-dimensional keystoning manually for this demonstration. Considering he is, in effect, projection-mapping onto the tiny bubbles in the crystal, thats impressive work. Check out the video embedded below.\nWith only around 38,000 points, the resolution isnt exactly high-def, but it is enough for a very impressive proof-of-concept. Its also not nearly as creepy as the Selectric-inspired mouth-ball that was the last [Ancient] project we featured. Its also a lot less likely to take your fingers off than the POV-based volumetric display [Ancient] was playing DOOM on a while back.\nFor the record, this one runs the same DOOM port, too its using the same basic code as [Ancient]s other displays, which you can find on GitHub under an MIT license.\nThanks to [Hari Wiguna] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4f4e\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u6210\u679c\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5f6b\u523b\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6620\u50cf\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u5149\u306e\u6563\u4e71\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "- 38,000\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u8a3c\u660e\u3059\u308b3D\u6620\u50cf\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- DOOM\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f"]}

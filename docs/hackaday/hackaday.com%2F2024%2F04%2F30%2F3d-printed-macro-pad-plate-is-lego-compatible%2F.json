Such seems to be the case with [joshmarinacci]s LEGO-compatible 3D-printed plate for a three-key macro pad. For a first foray into scratch-built keyboard construction, we think this is pretty great.\nThe idea here is threefold: the plate holds the switches in place, negates the need for a PCB, and makes it possible to build the case completely out of LEGO. In fact, [joshmarinacci]s plan for the keycaps even includes LEGO  they are going to 3D print little adapters that fit the key switchs stem on one side, and the underside of a 22 plate on the other.\nAlthough [joshmarinacci]s plan is to design a PCB for the next version, there is plenty to be said for combining the plate and the PCB by printing guides for the wires, which weve seen before. Weve also seen LEGO used to create a keyboard stand that fits just right.\u00a0 \nVia KBD"}

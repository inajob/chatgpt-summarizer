But silicon is simply one of many different semiconductor materials, and its possible to make working semiconductor devices in a less complex lab using some of the others. As an example, [Breaking Taps] has been working with copper (II) oxide, producing photodiodes, and coming within touching distance of a working matrix array.\nThe video below the break is a comprehensive primer on simple semiconductor production and the challenges of producing copper (II) oxide rather than the lower temperature copper (I) oxide. The devices made have a Schottky junction between the semiconductor and an aluminium conductor, and after some concerns about whether the silicon substrate is part of the circuit and even some spectacular destruction of devices, he has a working photodiode with a satisfying change on the curve tracer when light is applied. The finale is an array of the devices to form a rudimentary camera sensor, but sadly due to alignment issues its not quite there\u00a0 yet. We look forward to seeing it when he solves those problems.\nAs weve seen before, copper oxide isnt the only semiconductor material outside the silicon envelope.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f[Sam Zeloof]\u3084\u3001\u9285(II)\u9178\u5316\u7269\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30bb\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f[Breaking Taps]\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002\u9285(I)\u9178\u5316\u7269\u3088\u308a\u3082\u9285(II)\u9178\u5316\u7269\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u304c\u3001\u5149\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u5f62\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u9285\uff08II\uff09\u9178\u5316\u7269\u306e\u5149\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u5c0e\u4f53\u3068\u306e\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc\u63a5\u5408", "\u975e\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u7cfb\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u7d20\u5b50\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

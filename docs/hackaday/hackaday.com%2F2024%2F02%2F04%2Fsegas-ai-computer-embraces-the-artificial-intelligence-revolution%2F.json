Although this may not really raise eyebrows, whats interesting is that this was Segas 1986 attempt to cash in on Artificial Intelligence (AI) hype, with a home computer that could handle natural language. Based on the available software and documentation, it looked to be mostly targeted at younger children, with plans to launch it in the US later on, but ultimately it was quietly shelved by the end of the 1980s.\nPart of the Sega AI Computers mainboard, with the V20 MPU and ROMs.\nThe computer system itself is based around the NEC v20 8088-compatible MPU with 128 kB of RAM and a total of 512 kB of ROM, across multiple chips. The latter contains not only the character set, but also a speech table for the text to speech functionality and the Prolog-based operating system ROM. It is this Prolog-based environment which enables the AI functionality. For example, the diary application will ask the user a few questions about their day, and writes a grammatically correct diary entry for that day based on the responses.\nOn the systems touch panel overlays can be used through cartridge or tape-based application to make it easy for children to interact with the system, or a full-sized keyboard can be used instead. All together, 14 tapes and 26 cartridges (my cards) had their contents dumped, along with the contents of every single ROM in the system. The manual and any further documentation and advertising material that came with the system were scanned in, which you can peruse while you boot up your very own Sega AI Computer in MAME. Mind that the MAME system is still a work in progress, so bugs are to be expected. Even so, this is a rare glimpse at one of those aspirational systems that never made it out of the 1980s.", "title": "\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "1986\u5e74\u306b\u30bb\u30ac\u304cAI\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u767a\u58f2\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u306b\u306f\u9759\u304b\u306b\u4e2d\u6b62\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u3001NEC v20 MPU\u3001128KB\u306eRAM\u3001512KB\u306eROM\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001AI\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308bProlog\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3084\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u73fe\u5728MAME\u3067\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u5b50\u4f9b\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3084\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b", "\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u65e5\u8a18\u5165\u529b\u3084\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u8aad\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b", "\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u5e0c\u5c11\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5fa9\u5143\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30bb\u30acAI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4e00\u3064"]}

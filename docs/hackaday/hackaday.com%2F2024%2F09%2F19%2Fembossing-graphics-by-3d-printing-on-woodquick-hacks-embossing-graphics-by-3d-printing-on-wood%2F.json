[Cory] from Vancouver Hack Space was playing around with the 3D printing wood, and came up with the idea of creating raised tactile surfaces using a simple transfer process.\nWe dont often try to print directly onto a wooden surface for various reasons, but [Cory] wanted to give it a go. They hoped to get some grain patterns to transfer to the surface, but as they say in the blog entry, the beauty of wood patterns is in the colouration, which doesnt transfer. Next, they laser etched a logo into the wood surface to see how well that would transfer. It did create a discernable raised impression, but they forgot to mirror the image (oops!) and relevel the bed, so the results are less impressive than they could be. Still, its another useful technique to consider.\nEmbossing is the process by which braille sheets. This DIY braille encoder is pretty sweet. Of course the process can be simply decorative. Heres how to use a laser cutter to create your own embossing seals. The traditional way to emboss paper for a fancy effect was to use embossing powder to selectively change the properties of drying paper. But how can you make the stuff for cheap?"}

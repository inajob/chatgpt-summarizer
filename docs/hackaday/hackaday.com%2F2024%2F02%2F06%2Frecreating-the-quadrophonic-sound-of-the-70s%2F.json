Left and right speakers in the front and back, with a center speaker and a subwoofer. But the 5.1 setup wasnt always the standard (and still isnt the only standard); after stereo was adopted mid-century, audio engineers wanted more than just two channels and briefly attempted a four-channel system called quadrophonic sound. Theres still some media from the 70s that can be found that is built for this system, such as [Alan]s collection of 8-track tapes. These tapes are getting along in years, so he built a quadrophonic 8-track replica to keep the experience alive.\nThe first thing needed for a replica system like this is digital quadrophonic audio files themselves. Since the format died in the late 70s, theres not a lot available in modern times so [Alan] has a dedicated 8-track player connected to a four-channel audio-to-USB device to digitize his own collection of quadrophonic 8-track tapes. This process is destructive for the decades-old tapes so it is very much necessary.\nWith the audio files captured, he now needs something to play them back with. A Raspberry Pi is put to the task, but it needs a special sound card in order to play back the four channels simultaneously. To preserve the feel of an antique 8-track player hes cannibalized parts from three broken players to keep the cassette loading mechanism and track indicator display along with four VU meters for each of the channels. A QR code reader inside the device reads a QR code on the replica 8-track cassettes when they are inserted which prompts the Pi to play the correct audio file, and a series of buttons along with a screen on the front can be used to fast forward, rewind and pause. A solenoid inside the device preserves the clunk sound typical of real 8-track players.\nAs a replica, this player goes to great lengths to preserve the essence of not only the 8-track era, but the brief quadrophonic frenzy of the early and mid 70s. Theres not a lot of activity around quadrophonic sound anymore, but 8-tracks are popular targets for builds and restorations, and a few that go beyond audio including this project that uses one for computer memory instead.\n\n", "title": "70\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u306e\u8981\u7d04\uff1a70\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u4e00\u6642\u671f\u6d41\u884c\u3057\u305f4\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u97f3\u97ff\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300c\u30af\u30ef\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u300d\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30028\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3057\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u30028\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u8868\u793a\u3001VU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30af\u30ef\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304c\u30018\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306f\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u5bfe\u8c61\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["70\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u306a8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u6b8b\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f4\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u540c\u6642\u518d\u751f\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306eQR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3001\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a8\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3057\u3066\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

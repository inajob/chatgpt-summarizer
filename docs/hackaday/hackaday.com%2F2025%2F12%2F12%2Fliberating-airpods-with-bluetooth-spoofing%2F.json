What is surprising, though, is that simple Bluetooth device ID spoofing unlocks these features, a fact which [Kavish Devar] took advantage of to write LibrePods, an AirPods controller app for Android and Linux.\nIn particular, LibrePods lets you control noise reduction modes, use ear detection to pause and unpause audio, detect head gestures, reduce volume when the AirPods detect you\u2019re speaking, work as configurable hearing aids, connect to two devices simultaneously, and configure a few other settings. The app needs an audiogram to let them work as hearing aids, and you\u2019ll need an existing audiogram \u2013 creating an audiogram requires too much precision. Of particular interest to hackers, the app has a debug mode to send raw Bluetooth packets to the AirPods. Unfortunately, a bug in the Android Bluetooth stack means that LibrePods requires root on most devices.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a hack enable hearing aid functionality without official Apple approval. However, while we have some people alter the hardware, AirPorts can\u2019t really be called hacker- or repair-friendly.\nThanks to [spiralbrain] for the tip!", "title": "\u300cLibrePods\uff1aAirPods\u3092Android\u3068Linux\u3067\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u300d", "body": "AirPods\u306f\u4ed6\u793e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u30da\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001\u4e3b\u6a5f\u80fd\u306fApple\u5c02\u7528\u3002LibrePods\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u7279\u5b9a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u89e3\u653e\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cLibrePods\uff1aAirPods\u3092Android\u3068Linux\u3067\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u300d", "\u300cBluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9ID\u306e\u507d\u88c5\u3067AirPods\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u89e3\u653e\u3059\u308b\u300d", "\u300cAirPods\u3092\u88dc\u8074\u5668\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u300d", "\u300cLibrePods\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067AirPods\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u6df1\u5800\u308a\u300d", "\u300c\u975e\u516c\u5f0f\u306b\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u88dc\u8074\u5668\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aAirPods\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d"]}

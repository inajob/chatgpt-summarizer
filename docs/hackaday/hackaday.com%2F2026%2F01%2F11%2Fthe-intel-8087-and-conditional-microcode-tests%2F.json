This microcode contains the details on how to perform the many types of specialized instructions, like cos and arctan, all of which decode into many microcode ops. These micro ops are executed by the microcode engine, which [Ken] will cover in more detail in an upcoming article, but which is effectively its own CPU.\nConditional instructions are implemented in hardware, integrating the states of various functional blocks across the die, ranging from the instruction decoder to a register. Here, the evaluation is performed as close as possible to the source of said parameter to save on wiring.\nImplementing this circuitry are multiplexers, with an example shown in the top die shot image. Depending on the local conditions, any of four pass transistors is energized, passing through that input. Not shown in the die shot image are the inverters or buffers that are required with the use of pass transistors to amplify the signal, since pass transistors do not provide that feature.\nDespite how firmly obsolete the 8087 is today, it still provides an amazing learning opportunity for anyone interested in ASIC design, which is why its so great that [Ken] and his fellow reverse-engineering enthusiasts keep plugging away at recovering all this knowledge.", "title": "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb8087\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\uff1a\u6d6e\u52d5\u5c0f\u6570\u70b9\u51e6\u7406\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8", "body": "Intel 8087\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002ASIC\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5b66\u3073\u306e\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb8087\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\uff1a\u6d6e\u52d5\u5c0f\u6570\u70b9\u51e6\u7406\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8", "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a8087\u306e\u7279\u5316\u547d\u4ee4\u3068\u5b9f\u884c\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "- 8087\u5185\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9f\u88c5\uff1a\u6761\u4ef6\u4ed8\u304d\u547d\u4ee4\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u3068\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\uff1a8087\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b", "- ASIC\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u5b66\u3073\uff1a\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a8087\u304b\u3089\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u77e5\u8b58\u306e\u4fa1\u5024"]}

You might still enjoy the pretty colors and shapes if you arent into math. Whats scary is that the page promises to have as little math as possible, but theres still quite a bit. Of course, we are sure you could go even deeper down the rabbit hole.\nThe algorithms core is a pair of 2D arrays representing cells that comprise the display area. One array holds the color of the cell, while another holds a velocity vector of the fluid in the cell. A vector, of course, has both a magnitude and a direction.\n\nOf course, there is more to it than that. The cells interpolate, but the animated graphics help explain it all. By the time you get to the momentum and divergence, youll need to remember a few things about partial differential equations. Luckily, they can be approximated numerically, so you can also read the code and forget about it.\nIf you want even deeper explanations, [kynd] suggests [Jamie Wongs] page, which uses WebGL and even lets you interact with the fluid. If you want to know what the Navier-Stokes equations are, these pages will help you a lot.\nWhile the pictures are pretty, fluid simulation has a lot of practical applications. Or, you can just use the kitchen sink. You can even do simulations with ASCII output if you like."}

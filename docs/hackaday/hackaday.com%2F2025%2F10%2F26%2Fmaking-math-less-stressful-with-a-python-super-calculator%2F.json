[David] said being able to work with symbolic math easily has helped his understanding of calculus and linear algebra. For statistics support he includes NumPy, pandas, and SciPy. NumPy is useful for creating multidimensional arrays and supports basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation; pandas is a library for operating on tabular data arranged into DataFrames, it can load data from spreadsheets (including Excel) and relational databases; and SciPy is a grab bag of operations designed for scientific computing, it includes some useful statistics operations, including common probability distributions, such as the binomial, normal, and Students t-distribution.\nFor regression analysis [David] includes statsmodels and Pingouin. If youre not familiar with the term regression analysis it basically refers to the process of curve fitting. When your data is two-dimensional, with one dependent variable, the simple linear regression algorithm will generate a function that fits the data as y = mx + b, including the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b); this can be extrapolated to higher dimensional data and other types of regression.\nIf you have an interest in symbolic math you might enjoy learning about Mathematica And Wolfram On The Raspberry Pi."}

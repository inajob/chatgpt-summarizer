Although much of the US is experiencing a particularly warm month, thats not the case in Germany where [rsappiawf] resides. Even so, they are having a good time charting the weather on their new solar-powered E-ink weather station.\nAnd in spite of the dark winter days, the device has been delivering weather updates for over a week on solar power alone. The brains of this operation is an ESP32 S3 Mini, which [rsappiawf] operated on a little bit. For starters, they removed the integrated RGB LED in order to save precious milliamps. Then they upgraded the voltage regulator to a TPS73733DCQR.\n[rsappiawf] also has a TPL5110 power timer breakout module in the mix, which saves even more power by only turning on every once in a while according to the potentiometer setting, and only then turning on the projects power. Check out the brief demo after the break, including the cool sliding action into the 3D-printed holder.\nTheres a lot you can do to lower power consumption in a project like this. Heres one that will go 60 days on a charge.\n\n", "title": "\u51ac\u306e\u3069\u3093\u3088\u308a\u611f\u3092\u5439\u304d\u98db\u3070\u3059\uff01\u592a\u967d\u5149\u3067\u52d5\u304fE-ink\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "\u6625\u304c\u8fd1\u3065\u304f\u4e2d\u3001\u6c17\u5019\u306e\u5fae\u5c0f\u306a\u5909\u5316\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3057\u51ac\u306e\u3046\u3064\u75c5\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u3088\u3046\u3002\u7c73\u56fd\u306f\u6696\u304b\u3044\u304c\u3001[rsappiawf]\u306e\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u3067\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u5f7c\u3089\u306f\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u306eE-ink\u5929\u6c17\u5c40\u3067\u5929\u5019\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002ESP32 S3 Mini\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb\u3092\u6291\u304860\u65e5\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u51ac\u306e\u3069\u3093\u3088\u308a\u611f\u3092\u5439\u304d\u98db\u3070\u3059\uff01\u592a\u967d\u5149\u3067\u52d5\u304fE-ink\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "ESP32 S3 Mini\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u592a\u967d\u5149\uff06\u7701\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u88c5\u7f6e", "TPL5110\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3067\u7701\u30a8\u30cd\uff01\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "60\u65e5\u9593\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u7701\u96fb\u529b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3000"]}

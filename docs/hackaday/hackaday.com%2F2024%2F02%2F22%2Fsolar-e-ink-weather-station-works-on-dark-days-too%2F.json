Although much of the US is experiencing a particularly warm month, thats not the case in Germany where [rsappiawf] resides. Even so, they are having a good time charting the weather on their new solar-powered E-ink weather station.\nAnd in spite of the dark winter days, the device has been delivering weather updates for over a week on solar power alone. The brains of this operation is an ESP32 S3 Mini, which [rsappiawf] operated on a little bit. For starters, they removed the integrated RGB LED in order to save precious milliamps. Then they upgraded the voltage regulator to a TPS73733DCQR.\n[rsappiawf] also has a TPL5110 power timer breakout module in the mix, which saves even more power by only turning on every once in a while according to the potentiometer setting, and only then turning on the projects power. Check out the brief demo after the break, including the cool sliding action into the 3D-printed holder.\nTheres a lot you can do to lower power consumption in a project like this. Heres one that will go 60 days on a charge.\n\n"}

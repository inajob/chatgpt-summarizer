Dont worry, its CES season out in Las Vegas and a company called Flappie has the solution  an AI-powered cat door that rejects dead mice and other would-be offerings.\nImage by Nathan Ingraham via Engadget\nIt works about like you might expect  theres a motion sensor and a night-vision camera on the exterior side of the door. Using Flappies unique and proprietary dataset, the door distinguishes between Tom and Jerry and keeps out unwanted guests with more than 90% accuracy. To do this, Flappie collected video of a lot of cats and prey in a variety of lighting conditions. Theres even a chip detection system that will reject all other cats.\nThankfully, its not all automation. The prey detection system can be turned off entirely, and there are manual switches on the inside for locking and unlocking the door at will. You dont even have to hook it up to the Internet, it seems.\nAmericans will have to wait a while, as the company is rolling out the door in Switzerland and Germany first. No word on when the US launch will take place, but interested parties can expect to pay around $399.\nOf course, this problem can be solved without AI as long as youre willing to review the situation and unlock the door yourself.", "title": "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u7528AI\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u6249\uff01\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u62d2\u5426\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2", "body": "Flappie\u304cAI\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u6620\u50cf\u3084\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3068\u732b\u3092\u5206\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u958b\u59cb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7d04399\u30c9\u30eb\u3002\u30c9\u30a2\u306e\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3082\u624b\u52d5\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u6249\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u7528AI\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u6249\uff01\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u62d2\u5426\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2", "\u30ae\u30d5\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u751f\u3051\u8d04\uff1fAI\u304c\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u5f3e\u304f\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30cd\u30b3\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01AI\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u5224\u5225\u3059\u308b\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2\u304c\u767a\u58f2", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\uff06\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u4fb5\u5165\u8005\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\uff01AI\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2", "\u732b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u56f0\u308a\u306e\u65b9\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u6620\u50cf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fAI\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u732b\u7528\u30c9\u30a2"]}

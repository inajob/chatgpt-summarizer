The reason for this is obvious: they got a very practical charge and discharge curve that chargers and inverters love, along with a great round trip efficiency. Meanwhile some are claiming that sodium-ion (Na+) batteries would be even better, but this is not borne out by the evidence, with [Will Prowse] testing and tearing down an Na+ battery to prove the point.\nThe OCV curve for LFP vs Na+ batteries.\nThe Hysincere brand battery that [Will] has on the test bench claims a nominal voltage of 12 V and a 100 Ah capacity, which all appears to be in place based on the cells found inside. The lower nominal voltage compared to LFPs 12.8 V is only part of the picture, as can be seen in the OCV curve. Virtually all of LFPs useful capacity is found in a very narrow voltage band, with only significant excursions when reaching around 98% or 10% of state of charge.\nWhat this means is that with existing chargers and inverters, there is a whole chunk of the Na+ discharge curve thats impossible to use, and chargers will refuse to charge Na+ batteries that are technically still healthy due to the low cell voltage. In numbers, this means that [Will] got a capacity of 82 Ah out of this particular 100 Ah battery, despite the battery costing twice that of a comparable LFP one.\nYet even after correcting for that, the internal resistance of these Na+ batteries appears to be significantly higher, giving a round trip efficiency of 60  92%, which is a far cry from the 95% to 99% of LFP. Until things change here, [Will] doesnt see much of a future for Na+ beyond perhaps grid-level storage and as a starter battery for very cold climates.\n\n"}

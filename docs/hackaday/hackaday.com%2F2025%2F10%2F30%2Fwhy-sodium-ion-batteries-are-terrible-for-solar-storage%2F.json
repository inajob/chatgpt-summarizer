The reason for this is obvious: they got a very practical charge and discharge curve that chargers and inverters love, along with a great round trip efficiency. Meanwhile some are claiming that sodium-ion (Na+) batteries would be even better, but this is not borne out by the evidence, with [Will Prowse] testing and tearing down an Na+ battery to prove the point.\nThe OCV curve for LFP vs Na+ batteries.\nThe Hysincere brand battery that [Will] has on the test bench claims a nominal voltage of 12 V and a 100 Ah capacity, which all appears to be in place based on the cells found inside. The lower nominal voltage compared to LFPs 12.8 V is only part of the picture, as can be seen in the OCV curve. Virtually all of LFPs useful capacity is found in a very narrow voltage band, with only significant excursions when reaching around 98% or 10% of state of charge.\nWhat this means is that with existing chargers and inverters, there is a whole chunk of the Na+ discharge curve thats impossible to use, and chargers will refuse to charge Na+ batteries that are technically still healthy due to the low cell voltage. In numbers, this means that [Will] got a capacity of 82 Ah out of this particular 100 Ah battery, despite the battery costing twice that of a comparable LFP one.\nYet even after correcting for that, the internal resistance of these Na+ batteries appears to be significantly higher, giving a round trip efficiency of 60  92%, which is a far cry from the 95% to 99% of LFP. Until things change here, [Will] doesnt see much of a future for Na+ beyond perhaps grid-level storage and as a starter battery for very cold climates.\n\n", "title": "- LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3068\u7279\u6027\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u5206\u6790", "body": "LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u826f\u304f\u3001Na+\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u52a3\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u3068\u7279\u6027\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u5206\u6790", "- \u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aLFP\u3068\u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- \u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308b\u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u73fe\u72b6", "- \u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u76f8\u6027\uff1aLFP\u3068\u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u9055\u3044"]}

That was the thinking of [Bike Cook Robots] when it came time to revamp his desk. To that end, he whipped up a tidy macropad to make daily computing tasks easier.\nThe build is based around an Adafruit RP2040 Feather ThinkInk devboard, chosen because it plugs straight into a readily-available 4.2 inch e-ink. The display is tasked with showing icons that correspond to the macro assignments for the 3 x 4 array of mechanical keyboard switches. Everything is wrapped up in a 3D printed frame, with an bracket to mount it to the monitor arms on the desk. The macropad is set up to talk to a custom Python app that runs on the host machine, which handles triggering actions and can also talk back to the pad itself.\nThe combination of e-ink display and button pad is a great way to display the function of each key without excess complexity. Weve seen some other great builds in this space before, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u4f5c\u696d\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3002e-ink\u8868\u793a\u3068\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306b", "- Adafruit RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- E-ink\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "- Python\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

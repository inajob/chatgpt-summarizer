If you told [John Kemeny] at Dartmouth back in 1964 that people would be serving websites in Basic in the year 2024, hed probably be amazed after you explained what a website was. But thats what [Jamonholmgren] is doing.\n[Jamon] wrote his first Basic program when he was 12, which was a common thing to do. Recently, he decided to build and deploy a website using Basic, and so this project, qub (pronounced like cube), was born. The web server is modified from an existing source but adds features and many new features are planned.\n\nThe main program essentially creates a starter set of HTML and related files for the server. Honestly, we dont recommend a server in Basic, but it is fun to see Basic  granted a modern version of QuickBasic  being up to the task.\nIt would probably be smarter to dedicate an old phone to the task. Or you could stand up an old DOS computer, but thats probably not any better."}

But the R in radar still stands for Radio, and RF projects are always fraught, especially at microwave frequencies. Whats the radar enthusiast to do?\nWhile its not radar, subbing in ultrasonic sensors is how [Dzl] built this\u00a0sonar imaging system using a lot of radar porinciples. Initial experiments centered around the ubiquitous dual-transducer ultrasonic modules used in all sorts of ranging and detection project, with some slight modifications to tap into the received audio signal rather than just using the digital output of the sensor. An ESP32 and a 24-bit ADC were used to capture the echo signal, and a series of filters were implemented in code to clean up the audio and quantify the returns. [Dzl] also added a downsampling routine to bring the transmitted pings and resultant echoes down in the human-audible range; they sound more like honks than pings, but its still pretty cool.\nTo make the simple range sensor more radar-like, [Dzl] needed to narrow the beamwidth of the sensor and make the whole thing steerable. That required a switch to an automotive backup sensor, which uses a single transducer, and a 3D-printed parabolic dish reflector that looks very much like a satellite TV dish. With this assembly stuck on a stepper motor to swivel it back and forth, [Dzl] was able to get pretty good images showing clear reflections of objects in the lab.\nIf you want to start seeing with sound, [Dzl]s write-up has all the details youll need. If real radar is still your thing, though, weve got something for that too.\nThanks to [Vanessa] for the tip.", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080", "body": "\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30bd\u30ca\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080", "- \u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "- ESP32\u3068ADC\u3067\u97f3\u6ce2\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30d1\u30e9\u30dc\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3067\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u5e45\u3092\u72ed\u3081\u308b\u5de5\u592b", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

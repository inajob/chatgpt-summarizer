Could putting liquid resin into an ultrasonic cleaner help degas it? Would it help remove bubbles, resulting in a cleaner pour and nicer end product? What we love is that she tried it out and shared her results. She purchased an ultrasonic cleaner and proceeded to mix two batches of clear resin, giving one an ultrasonic treatment and leaving the other untouched as a control.\nSadly, the test piece had considerably more surface bubbles than the untreated control, as well as a slight discoloration.\nThe results were interesting and unexpected. Initially, the resin in the ultrasonic bath showed visible bubbles rising to the surface which seemed promising. Unfortunately, this did not lead to fewer bubbles in the end product.\n[Wendy]s measurements suggest that the main result of putting resin in an ultrasonic bath was an increase in its temperature. Overheating the resin appears to have led to increased off-gassing and bubble formation prior to and during curing, which made for poor end results. The untreated resin by contrast cured with better color and much higher clarity. If you would like to skip directly to the results of the two batches, its right here at 9:15 in.\nDoes this mean its a total dead end? Maybe, but even if the initial results werent promising, its a pretty interesting experiment and were delighted to see [Wendy] walk through it. Do you think theres any way to use the ultrasonic cleaner in a better or different way? If so, let us know in the comments.\nThis isnt the first time people have tried to degas epoxy resin by thinking outside the box. Weve covered a very cheap method that offered surprising results, as well as a way use a modified paint tank in lieu of purpose-made hardware."}

[Paul] had everything he needed to pick up the gauntlet, and evidently did so promptly. The drive is a classic Commodore 1541, which means youll want to watch the demo video at 2x speed or better. (If you thought loading times felt slow in the old days, theyre positively glacial by modern standards.) The old floppy drive is plugged into a Google Pixel 3 running Postmarket OS. Sure, you could do this on Android, but a fully open Linux system is obviously the hackers choice. As a bonus, it makes the whole endeavor almost trivial.\n\nBetween the seven-year-old phone and the forty-year-old disk drive is an Arduino Pro Micro, configured with the XUM1541 firmware by [OpenBCM] to act as a translator. On the phone, the VICE emulator pretends to be a C64, and successfully loads Impossible Mission from an original disk. Arguably, the phone doesnt sport the disk driveif anything, its the other way around, given the size differencebut we think [Paul Sanja] has proven the point regardless. Bravo, [Paul].\nThanks to [Joseph Eoff], who accidentally issued the challenge and submitted the tip. If youve vexed someone into hacking (or been so vexed yourself), dont hesitate to drop us a line!\nWe wish more people would try hacking their way through disagreements. It really, really beats a flame war.\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u8ab2\u984c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6", "- \u5909\u308f\u308a\u7a2e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3068\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u9023\u643a", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9OS\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u610f\u898b\u5bfe\u7acb\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

[Craig Shultz] and his crew of fine researchers at the Interactive Display Lab at the University of Illinois seem to agree, because they have come up with an ingenious hack to provide haptic feedback using readily-available parts.\nAn array of shapes showing some of the different possibilities for hapticoil soft buttons.\nThe hapticoil, as they call it, has a simple microspeaker at its heart. We didnt expect a tiny tweeter to have the oomph to produce haptic feedback, and on its own it doesnt, as finger pressure stops the vibrations easily. The secret behind the hapticoil is to couple the speaker hydraulically to a silicone membrane. In other words, stick the thing in some water, and let that handle the pressure from a smaller soft button on the silicone membrane. That button can be virtually any shape, as seen here.\nAside from the somewhat sophisticated electronics that allow the speaker coil to be both button and actuator (by measuring inductance changes when pressure is applied, while simultaneously driven as a speaker), theres nothing here a hacker couldnt very easily replicate: a microspeaker, a 3D printed enclosure, and a silicone membrane that serves as the face of the haptic soft button. Thats not to say we arent given enough info replicate the electronics; the researchers are kind enough to provide a circuit diagram in figure eight of their paper.\nIn the video below, you can see a finger-mounted version used to let a user feel pressing a button in virtual reality, which raises some intriguing possibilities. The technology is also demonstrated on a pen stylus and a remote control.\nThis isnt the first time weve featured hydraulic haptics  [Craig] was also involved with an electroosmotic screen we covered previously, as well as a glove that used the same trick. This new microspeaker technique does seem much more accessible to the hacker set, however.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u611f\u89e6\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3", "body": "\u89e6\u899a\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u62bc\u4e0b\u611f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u611f\u89e6\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3", "- \u6c34\u306e\u529b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u6280\u8853", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u7c21\u5358\uff01\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30ea\u30a2\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u7528\u306e\u89e6\u899a\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

Well, actually, British telecom provider O2 has. As The Guardian reports, they have an AI chatbot that acts like a 78-year-old grandmother and receives phone calls. Of course, since the grandmother\u2014Daisy, by name\u2014doesnt get any real phone calls, anyone calling that number is probably a scammer. Daisys specialty? Keeping them tied up on the phone.\nWhile this might just seem like a prank for revenge, it is actually more than that. Scamming people is a numbers game. Most people wont bite. So, to be successful, scammers have to make lots of calls. Daisy can keep one tied up for around 40 minutes or more.\n\nYou can see some of Daisys antics in the video below. Or listen to Daisy do her thing in the second video. When a bogus tech support agent tried to direct Daisy to the Play Store, she replied, Did you say pastry? Some of them became quite flustered. She even has her own homepage.\nWhile we have mixed feelings about some AI applications, this is one we think everyone can get onboard with. Well, everyone but the scammers.\nIt might not do voice, but you can play with local AI models easily now. Spoofing scammers is the perfect job for the worst summer intern ever.\n\n"}

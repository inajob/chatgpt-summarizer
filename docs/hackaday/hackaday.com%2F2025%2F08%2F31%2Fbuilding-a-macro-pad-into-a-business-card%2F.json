PCB business cards try to get around this problem, but while impressive, most won\u2019t keep the recipient engaged for a very long time. [Cole Olsen]\u2019s macro pad business card, on the other hand, might actually get regular use. The card has three buttons and a rotary encoder as controls, with an RGB LED to indicate the card\u2019s current mode. It can perform three sets of functions: general productivity, serving as a presentation remote, and controlling music. The scroll wheel is the main control, and can switch through windows, desktops, and tabs, page through slides, and control music volume. The card itself is made out of a PCB, the exposed side of which contains [Cole]\u2019s contact information, and the other side of which is covered by a 3D-printed case. As thick as it is, this might be stretching the definition of \u201ccard\u201d a bit, but as a mechanical engineer, [Cole] did want to demonstrate some mechanical design. A nice!nano wireless keyboard development board running ZMK firmware reads the sensors and sends commands. Conveniently for a presentation remote, the card is powered by a rechargeable battery and can work wirelessly (as a side benefit, if a recipient were minded to get rid of this card, the lithium-polymer battery would probably substantially delay disposal). [Cole] writes that he was inspired by many of the other impressive business cards we\u2019ve covered. Some of the macro pads we\u2019ve seen have been marvels of miniaturization in their own right."}

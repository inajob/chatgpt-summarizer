Back in its day, it was a cult piece that some have dubbed the \u201cRolex on the wall.\u201d Wireds recent coverage of the clock reminded us of just how cool it is on the inside. And to dig in, we like\u00a0[Attoparsec]\u2019s restoration project on his own mid-1980s Geochron, lovingly fixing up a clock he picked up online.\n[Attoparsec]\u2019s recent restoration shares insights into the clock\u2019s fascinating mechanics. Using a synchronous motor, transparent slides, and a lighted platen, the Geochron works like a glorified slide projector, displaying the analemma\u2014a figure-eight pattern that tracks the sun\u2019s position over the year.\nBut if youre looking for a digital version, way back in 2011 we showcased [Justin]\u2019s LED hack of FlorinC\u2019s \u201cWise Clock\u201d, which ingeniously emulated the Geochron\u2019s day-night pattern using RGB LEDs, swapping out the faceplate for a world map printed on vellum. Thats probably a much more reasonable way to go these days. Why havent we seen more remakes of these?"}

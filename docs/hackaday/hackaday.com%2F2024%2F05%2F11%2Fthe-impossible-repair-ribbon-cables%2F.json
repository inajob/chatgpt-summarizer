These cables are extremely difficult to repair as they cant be soldered to, and since they are usually custom to the device in question. All is not lost though, as [Spare Time Repair] shows us with the cable on a Honeywell heating controller broken by a user attempting to remove the battery with a screwdriver.\nThe whole process can be seen in the video below the break, and it involves the use of a vinyl cutter to cut the pattern of tracks in aluminium tape stuck on a sheet of acetate. This makes a new piece of ribbon cable, however its still a step short of being part of the circuit. His challenge is to make a clip tight enough to attach it to the intact part of the broken cable and maintain contact, then to hope that the new piece of cable bent back on itself can make enough contact for the device to work.\nAt the end of it all he has a working Honeywell controller, though as he points out its a device he has little interest in. Instead this opens a window on an extremely useful technique that should be of relevance far beyond the world of heating. Theres one machine close to home for us that could use this technique, for example.\n\n"}

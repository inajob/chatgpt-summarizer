Still, some out there still like to etch their PCBs at home. If that sounds like you, you might see some value in [Chris Borge]s PCB agitator.\u00a0\nThe design mostly relies on 3D printed parts, including the main body. It has a heavy base which is filled with concrete to keep it nicely weighed down on the table. A table for holding a PCB and fluid tank is then installed on top, via a bearing which allows it to pivot in one axis. An Arduino Nano commands the agitation of the table top, and hence the PCB etching tank, with a servo used to actually shift the table back and forth.\nIts a simple design  far simpler than some of the advanced coffee-making hardware weve seen recently. Regardless, it gets the job done, and done well! In testing, it accelerated [Chris]s etching jobs significantly, were talking hours here. Meanwhile, if you dont have a 3D printer on hand, you could always try building one out of junk instead!\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067PCB\u3092\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064PCB\u30a2\u30b8\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Arduino Nano\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u91cd\u307f\u4ed8\u3051\u3055\u308c\u305f\u53f0\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u3001\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u3082\u69cb\u7bc9\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fPCB\u632f\u76ea\u5668\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "PCB\u88fd\u9020\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528PCB\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

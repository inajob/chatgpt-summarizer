Still, some out there still like to etch their PCBs at home. If that sounds like you, you might see some value in [Chris Borge]s PCB agitator.\u00a0\nThe design mostly relies on 3D printed parts, including the main body. It has a heavy base which is filled with concrete to keep it nicely weighed down on the table. A table for holding a PCB and fluid tank is then installed on top, via a bearing which allows it to pivot in one axis. An Arduino Nano commands the agitation of the table top, and hence the PCB etching tank, with a servo used to actually shift the table back and forth.\nIts a simple design  far simpler than some of the advanced coffee-making hardware weve seen recently. Regardless, it gets the job done, and done well! In testing, it accelerated [Chris]s etching jobs significantly, were talking hours here. Meanwhile, if you dont have a 3D printer on hand, you could always try building one out of junk instead!\n\n"}

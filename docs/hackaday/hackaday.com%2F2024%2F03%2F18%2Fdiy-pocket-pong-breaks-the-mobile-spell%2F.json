Well, we already knew the 90s were back, but its nice to see that even older stuff is coming along with it. The kids are alright.\nWhether you want to play alone or with a friend, its a classic to have in your pocket for sure. The brains behind this 70s-era operation is a Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3, which takes input from the two potentiometers and outputs the game on a 128 x 64 OLED. Theres also a small buzzer for when the ball hits the paddle, or you or your friend slips one past the goalie.\nOur favorite part of this build has to be the DIY rivets that hold the OLED in place. [Athul] built posts into the enclosure that get heat-smashed into place with a soldering iron. Pretty neat, huh?\nPONG is a specific thrill, certainly. How can it be more thrilling? Maybe with LEDs instead of a screen?

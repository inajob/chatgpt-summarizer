This time around, Elliot and Dan ring in a new year of awesome hacks with quite an eclectic mix. We kick things off with a Pluto pity party and find out why the tiny ex-planet deserved what it got. What do you do if you need to rename a bunch of image files? You rope a local large-language model in for the job, of course. Well take a look at how pinball machines did their thing before computers came along, take a fractal dive into video feedback, and localize fireworks with a fleet of Raspberry Pi listening stations. Ever wonder what makes a GPS receiver tick? The best way to find out might be to build one from scratch. Looking for some adventure? A ride on an electroluminescent surfboard might do, or perhaps a DIY Vomit Comet trip would be more your style. And make sure you stick around for our discussion on attempts to optimize surgery efficiency, and our look back at 2023s top trends in the hardware world.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\n\nEpisode 251 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Crazy Horse] who won a Podcast T-shirt by identifying the ring of a field telephone.\nThanks to Chaosvermittlung for setting up the demo.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\n37C3: You Think It\u2019s Bad With Pluto?

And yet, every now and then, we hear about fresh attention for an ancient device. Consider the ancient SoundBlaster sound card that first hit the market 31 years ago. [Mark] noticed that a recent update squashed a new bug on an old piece of gear.\nJump over to the Linux kernel archive, and youll find a pull request for v6.16-rc3 from [Takashi Iwai]. The update featured fixes for a number of sound devices, but one stands out amongst the rest. Its the SoundBlaster AWE32 ISA sound card, with [Iwai] noting we still got a bug report after 25 years. The bug in question appears to have been reported in 2023\u00a0by a user running Fedora 39 on a 120 MHz Pentium-based machine.\nThe fixes themselves are not\u00a0particularly interesting. They merely concern minutiae about the DMA modes used with the old hardware. The new updates ensure that DMA modes cannot be changed while the AWE32 is playing a PCM audio stream, and that DMA setups are disabled when changing modes. This helps avoid system lockups and/or ugly noises emanating from the output of the soundcard.\nIts incredibly unlikely this update will affect you, unless youre one of a handful of users still using an ISA soundcard in 2025. Still, if you are  and good on you  youll be pleased someone still cares about your user experience. Meanwhile, if youre aware of any other obscure old-school driver updates going on out there, dont hesitate to let us know on the tips line. Want to relive your ISA cards glory days?

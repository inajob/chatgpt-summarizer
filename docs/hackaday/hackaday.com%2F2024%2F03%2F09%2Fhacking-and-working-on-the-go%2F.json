This includes a portable audio interface to run my podcast mic, two (count them) two Linux computers, and all manner of simple hacking tools. Microcontrollers with USB/serial adapters built in are a godsend.\nBut putting together the minimal setup was no easy task! Alone the USB cable assortment I had to bring was astounding. And in the end, it looks like I forgot a USB-B mini, and good luck finding that at the local drug store. (I know! But the Zoom recorder wants mini. Dont ask me why.)\nAnd then theres the power adapters  brick for the laptop, USB-C fast charger for the Steam Deck, another wall-plug USB for recharging the power banks. And of course, this silly custom keyboard which Im so used to typing on, and which embodies so much muscle memory in its macros that Im practically helpless without it.\nSo fundamentally, Im astounded by the amount of functionality I could cram into my pack, but Im also aghast at all the little things that add up around the edges. And Im sure that Ill find stuff that Im missing in the next few weeks.\nDo you need to travel for work with your full kit? Whats your approach? Minimal? Maximal?

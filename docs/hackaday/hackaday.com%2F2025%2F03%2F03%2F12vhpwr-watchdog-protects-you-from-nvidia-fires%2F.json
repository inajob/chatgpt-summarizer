New 5080 and 500 GPUs come with this connector, and theyre once again fire-prone. Well, what if youre stuck with a newly-built 5080, unwilling to give it up, still hoping to play the newest games or run LLMs locally? [Timo Birnschein] has a simple watchdog solution for you, and its super easy to build.\nAll it takes is an Arduino, three resistors, and three thermistors. Place the thermistors onto the connectors problematic spots, download the companion software from GitHub, and plug the Arduino into your PC. If a temperature anomaly is detected, like one of the thermistors approaching 100C, the Arduino will simply shut down your PC. The software also includes a tray icon, temperature graphing, and stability features.\u00a0 All is open-source  breadboard it, flash it. You can even add more thermistors to the mix if youd like!\nThis hack certainly doesnt just help protect you from Nvidias latest creation  it can help you watch over any sort of potentially hot mod, and its very easy to build. Want to watch over connectors on your 3D printer? Build one of these! Weve seen 12VHPWR have plenty of problems in the past on Nvidias cards  it looks like there are quite a few lessons Nvidia is yet to learn.", "title": "- Nvidia\u306e12VHPWR\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "body": "Nvidia\u306e12VHPWR\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306f\u518d\u3073\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3002Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067PC\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- Nvidia\u306e12VHPWR\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- 5080 GPU\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u6e29\u5ea6\u76e3\u8996\u88c5\u7f6e", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u76e3\u8996\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

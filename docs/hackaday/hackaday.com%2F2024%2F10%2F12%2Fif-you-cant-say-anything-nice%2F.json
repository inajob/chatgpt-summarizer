This week, we got an above average number of useless negative comments. A project was described as looking like a \u201cturd\u201d \u2013 for the record I love the hacker\u2019s angular and futuristic designs, but it doesn\u2019t have to be to your taste. Then someone else is like \u201cyou don\u2019t even need a computer case.\u201d Another commenter informed us that he doesn\u2019t like to watch videos for the thirtieth time. (Yawn!)\nWhat all of these comments have in common is that they\u2019re negative, low value, non-constructive, and frankly have no place on Hackaday. The vast majority are just kind of Eeyorey complaining about how someone else is enjoying a chocolate ice cream, and the commenter prefers strawberry. But then some of them turn nasty. Why? If someone makes a project that you don\u2019t like, they didn\u2019t do it to offend you. Just move on quietly to one you do like. We publish a hack every three hours like a rubidium clockwork, with a couple of original content pieces scattered in-between on weekdays.\nAnd don\u2019t get us wrong: we love comments that help improve a project. There\u2019s a not-so-fine line between \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you design it with trusses to better hold the load?\u201d and \u201cwhy did you paint it black, because blue is the superior color\u201d. You know what we mean. Constructive criticism, good. Pointless criticism, bad.\nIt was to the point that we were discussing just shutting down the comments entirely. But then we got gems! [Maya Posch]\u2019s fantastic explainer about the Lagrange points had an error: one of the satellites that Wikipedia said was at an earth-moon Lagrange point is actually in normal orbit around the moon. It only used the Lagrange point as a temporary transit orbit. Says who? One of the science instrument leads on the space vehicle in question. Now that is a high-value comment, both because it corrects a mistake and enlightens us all, but also because it shows who is reading Hackaday!\nOr take [Al Williams]\u2019s article on mold-making a cement \u201cpaper\u201d airplane. It was a cool technique, but the commenters latched onto his assertion that you couldn\u2019t fly a cement plane, and the discussions that ensued are awesome. Part of me wanted to remind folks about the nice mold-making technique on display, but it was such a joy to go down that odd rabbit hole, I forgive you all!\nWe have an official \u201cbe nice\u201d policy about the comments, and that extends fairly broadly. We really don\u2019t want to hear what you don\u2019t like about someone\u2019s project or the way they presented it, because it brings down the people out there who are doing the hard work of posting their hacks. And hackers have the highest priority on Hackaday.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

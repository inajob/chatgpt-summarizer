Why 6502? Well, the emulator youre working on (its partially-written at the start of the game; you need only debug and finish the job) is for a fantasy system called the NEEES an antique game console released in 1983. Its the NEEES and not NES for two reasons. One, Nintendo has lawyers and they really, really know how to use them. Two, by creating a fantasy console that is not-quite-a-Famicom, the goalposts for EmuDevz can be moved a bit closer in.\n\nThe in-game emulator will handle most NES behavior, assuming you do your part correctly. A selection of homebrew NES games is included with EmuDevz, and they all run fine. A neat touch is giving you the ROMs for offline use as rewards when you get them running correctly. If some edge cases and exotic behaviours get left behind in the interests of simplicity, just remember its not a NES, its a NEEES, and who can say? Perhaps this simplified system is exactly how it worked in the alternate universe where this game is set.\nAside from the invaluable assembly code, the work is done in JavaScript, which might not be everybodys cup of tea. On the other hand, the whole thing is open-source (MIT license for the code, CC for the content) so if you really, really hate JS but love the idea of a learning game like this, you could fork to the language of your choice and learn even more.\nRegardless of the language used, we like this model and think the game where you learn to make games is a great educational model for programming skills that ought to be used more often. For an idea of what it looks like, check out the trailer below.\nThanks to [Rodrigo Alfonso] for the tip. If youve got a great gamified learning tool  or any other cool hack, for that matter  the tips line is fun and rewarding, even if we havent tried to gamify it.\n<!--more-->\n"}

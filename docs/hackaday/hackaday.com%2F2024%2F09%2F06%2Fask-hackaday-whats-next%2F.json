But sometimes you sit back in a reflective mood, and ask yourself: didnt this all used to be more exciting? If you too have done that, perhaps its worth considering how our world of hardware hacking is fueled, and what makes stuff new and interesting.\nHardware projects are like startup fads\nWhen AliExpress has hundreds of kits for them, Nixie clocks are a mature project sector, by any measure.\nHardware projects are like startup fads, they follow the hype cycle. Take Nixie clocks for instance, theyre cool as heck, but here in 2024 theres not so much thats exciting about them. If you made one in 2010 you were the talk of the town, in 2015 everyone wanted one, but perhaps by 2020 yours was simply Yet Another Nixie Clock. Now you can buy any number of Nixie clock kits on Ali, and their shine has definitely worn off. Do you ever have the feeling that the supply of genuinely new stuff is drying up, and its all getting a bit samey? Perhaps its time to explore this topic.\nI have a theory that hardware hacking goes in epochs, each one driven by a new technology. If you think about it, the Arduino was an epoch-defining moment in a readily available and easy to use microcontroller board; they may be merely a part and hugely superseded here in 2024 but back in 2008 they were nothing short of a revolution if youd previously has a BASIC Stamp. The projects which an Arduino enabled produced a huge burst of creativity from drones to 3D printers to toaster oven reflow and many, many, more, and its fair to say that Hackaday owes its early-day success in no small part to that little board from Italy. To think of more examples, the advent of affordable 3D printers around the same period as the Arduino, the Raspberry Pi, and the arrival of affordable PCB manufacture from China were all similar such enabling moments. A favourite of mine are the Espressif Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers, which produced an explosion of cheap Internet-connected projects. Suddenly having Wi-Fi went from a big deal to built-in, and an immense breadth of new projects came from those parts.\nTell us then, Whats new?\nSo back to 2024, and a Hackaday writer at her desk in the English countryside. 3D printers are still our bread and butter, but theyre on Amazon special offer these days. Small Linux boards are ten a penny, and microcontrollers that put the Arduinos ATmega in the shade are only a few cents from China. It almost feels as though everything is mainstream, and all were getting are increments rather than huge leaps. I want new stuff again, I want exciting stuff!\nHappily, the world of technology doesnt stand still. We all know that the Next Big Thing is just around the corner, and our desire to make cool new stuff will be revitalised by it. But what will it be? My eyes are on ASIC fabrication, I think Tiny Tapeout must only be the start of perhaps the most exciting epoch of them all. But what do you think on the matter, where will your Next Big Thing come from? Were really interested to hear your views in the comments.\nHeader image: The RepRap Mendel 3D printer, one of the more successful early affordable designs.

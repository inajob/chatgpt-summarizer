It actually looks like something out of science fiction, with its cylindrical design, red bumpers, and many sensors. He decided to try and restore the research-grade robot to functionality with the aid of modern hardware.\nRight away, its clear this was an expensive and serious bit of kit. Its full of hardcore gears and motors for driving three rubber-tired wheels, each of which has a pivoting mount for steering the thing. Through his research, [Clay] was able to find some ancient websites documenting university work using the robots. His understanding is that the platform was designed for researchers experimenting with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and other robotic navigation tasks.\n[Clay] doesnt just settle for a teardown, though. Hes been able to get the platform running again in one sense, using an Arduino to manually run the robots drive controls under the command of a gamepad. Without official software or resources, its perhaps unlikely hell be able to get the stock hardware to do much without completely rebraining it, so this method makes sense. In future he hopes to get the bumper sensors and sonar modules working too.\nIts a fair effort given [Clay] was working with no documentation and no supporting software. Weve seen similar efforts for robotic arms before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

Theyre not always the most well-regarded mixers, but [Simon] saw an opportunity to do something a bit different with it. He decided to show us all how you can use a mixer as a synthesizer.\n[Simon] actually picked up the no-input technique from [Andreij Rublev] and decided to try it out on his own equipment. The basic idea is to use feedback through the mixer to generate tones. To create a feedback loop, connect an auxiliary output on the mixer to one of the mixers input channels. The gain on the channel is then increased on the channel to create a great deal of feedback. The mixers output is then gently turned up, along with the volume on the channel that has formed the feedback loop. If youve hooked things up correctly, you should have some kind of tone feedbacking through the mixer. Want to change the pitch? Easy  just use the mixers EQ pots!\nIts pretty easy to get some wild spacey sounds going. Get creative and you can make some crunchy sounds or weird repeating tones if you play with the mixers built in effects. Plus, the benefit of a mixer is that it has multiple channels. You can create more feedback loops using the additional channels if you have enough auxiliary sends for the job. Stack them up or weave them together and you can get some wild modulation going.\nWho needs a modular synth when you can do all this with a four channel mixer and some cables? Video after the break.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\u30b4\u30df\u7bb1\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u7121\u8996\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3044Behringer\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u97f3\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u9ad8\u3055\u306f\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u306eEQ\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b4\u30df\u7bb1\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5185\u8535\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u306a\u97f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

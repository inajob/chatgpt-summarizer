Oh, wait, we mean 12-qubit. That makes more sense. Code named Tunnel Falls, the chip uses tiny silicon spin quantum bits, which Intel says are more advantageous than other schemes for encoding qubits. Theres a video about the device below.\nIt is a research chip and will be available to universities that might not be able to produce their own hardware. You probably arent going to find them listed on your favorite online reseller. Besides, the chip isnt going to be usable on a breadboard. It is still going to take a lot of support to get it running.\nIntel claims the silicon qubit technology is a million times smaller than other qubit types. The size is on the order of a device transistor  50 nanometers square  simplifying things and allowing denser devices. In silicon spin qubits, information resides in the up or down spin of a single electron.\nOf course, even Intel isnt suggesting that 12 qubits are enough for a game-changing quantum computer, but you do have to start somewhere. This chip may enable more researchers to test the technology and will undoubtedly help Intel accelerate its research to the next step.\nThere is a lot of talk that silicon is the way to go for scalable quantum computing. It makes you wonder if theres anything silicon cant do? You can access todays limited quantum computers in the proverbial cloud.\n\n"}

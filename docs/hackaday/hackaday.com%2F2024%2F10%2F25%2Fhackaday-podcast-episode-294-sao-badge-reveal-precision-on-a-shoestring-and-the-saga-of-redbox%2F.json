From there theyll go over the results of a particularly challenging installment of Whats that Sound?, discuss a promising DIY lathe that utilizes 3D printed parts filled with concrete, and ponder what the implosion of Redbox means for all of their disc-dispensing machines that are still out in the wild.\nYoull also hear about custom macropads, lifting SMD pins, and how one hacker is making music with vintage electronics\u00a0 learning kits. Finally, theyll reassure listeners that the shifting geopolitical landscape probably wont mean the end of Hackaday.io anytime soon, and how some strategically placed pin headers can completely change how you approach designing your own PCBs.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 294 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nThe 2024 Hackaday Supercon SAO Badge Reveal\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [I can see the sounds] for guessing the HAARP.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nA 3D Printed, Open Source Lathe?\n\nPrecision CNC With Epoxy Granite\nExperiments In Creating The Best Epoxy Granite\n\n\nRedbox Is Dead, But The Machines Are Kind Of Hanging On\n\nRedbox hack reveals customer info. from 2K rentals  Ars Technica\nFoone: the unit Ive got an image for has records going \u2026  digipres.club\n\n\nLibre Space Foundation Aims To Improve Satellite Tech\n\nFlying The First Open Source Satellite\n32C3: So You Want To Build A Satellite?\nOpen Source CubeSats Ease The Pain Of Building Your Own\nHow To Build A CubeSat\nSatNOGS  Global Network of Ground Stations\n\n\nKeeping Tabs On An Undergraduate Projects Lab\u2019s Door Status\nDIY Air Bearings, No Machining Required\n\nLearn 40 Years Of Mech Prototyping At Lightspeed\nHigh-Precision Air Bearing CNC Lathe And Grinder\n\n\nI2C The Hard Way\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\n3D Printed Tires, By The Numbers\nZero To Custom MacroPad In 37 Easy Steps\nMake Your Own Remy The Rat This Halloween\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nGive Your SMD Components A Lift\n75-In-One Music\nFiguring Out The Most Efficient Way To Reuse Bags Of Desiccant\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nWill .IO Domain Names Survive A Geopolitical Rearrangement?\nHacker Tactic: Building Blocks\n\nPower Supply PCB Redesign\n\n\n", "title": "- \u300c2024 Hackaday Supercon\uff1a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "body": "2024\u5e74Hackaday Supercon\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3084DIY\u5de5\u5177\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c2024 Hackaday Supercon\uff1a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u65cb\u76e4\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "- \u300c\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5d29\u58ca\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u914d\u4fe1\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u672a\u6765\u300d", "- \u300c\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3068SMD\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u65b9\u300d", "- \u300c\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c6\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30d4\u30f3\u30d8\u30c3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u300d"]}

While the patterns are immediately obvious to the human eye, anyone whos run one can tell you that theyre pretty computationally expensive to produce. Fortunately, as with many things in graphics, rendering the Mandelbrot set can be easily parallelized.\nThats what [rak277] and [ir93] demonstrate in their RP2040-based finals project. Computron, as they call it, is a network of Raspberry Pi Picos that work together to compute a visualization of the Mandelbrot set and show it on a VGA display. The Computron is made of two or more math units and one projection unit. The math units communicate over a shared I\u00b2C bus with the projection unit to first divide the workload and then compute their share of the work.\nThis project shows both the strengths and limitations of parallel computation. It makes use of multiple math units on a highly parallelizable workload, but as more math units are added there are diminishing performance gains due to the increased communications load on the network, which [rak277] and [ir93] suspect to be the current bottleneck in the Computron.\nIf youre fresh out of Pi Picos, and dont mind waiting awhile, you could always crank out a Mandelbrot set on your trusty Atari 800 in BASIC."}

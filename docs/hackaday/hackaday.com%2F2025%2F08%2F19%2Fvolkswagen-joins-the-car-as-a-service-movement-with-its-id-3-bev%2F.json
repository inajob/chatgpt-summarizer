The software unlock changes the maximum motor output from 150 kW to 170 kW, which some users report as being noticeable.\nRegardless of whether you find this to be a good deal, the concept of Car-As-A-Service (CAAS) has becoming increasingly prevalent, with the BBC article referencing BMWs heated seats subscription and Mercedes acceleration subscription. Considering that all the hardware is already in the car that you purportedly purchased, this is sure to rub people the wrong way, not to mention that from a car tuning perspective this seems to suggest that third-party tuners dont need to apply.\nThanks to [Robert Piston] for the tip."}

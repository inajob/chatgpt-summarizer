Its good at some of these tasks, and absolutely incapable of others. [Filipe dos Santos Branco] and [Edward Gu] had an out of the box idea, though. What if ChatGPT could do something musical?\nThey built a system that, at the press of a button, would query ChatGPT for a 10-note melody in a given musical key. Once the note sequence is generated by the large language model, its played out by a PWM-based synthesizer running on a Raspberry Pi Pico.\nUltimately, ChatGPT is no musical genius. Its simply picking a bunch of notes from a list that are known to work together melodically; thats the whole point of musical keys. It would have been wild if it generated some riffs on the level of\u00a0Stairway to Heaven or Spontaneous Devotion,\u00a0but that might be asking for too much.\nHeres the question, though. If you trained a large language model, but got it to digest sheet music instead of written texts could it learn to write music in various genres and styles? If someone isnt working on that already, theres surely an entire PhD you could get out of that idea alone. We should talk!\nIn any case, its one of the more creative projects from the ever-popular ECE 4760 class at Cornell. Weve featured a bunch of projects from the class over the years, and noted how the course now runs on the RP2040.\n"}

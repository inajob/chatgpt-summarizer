This project from [JGJMatt] ticks all our boxes  the build creates a planar speaker that uses salvaged magnets from a hard drive.\nA planar speaker, according to the post, uses wires and magnets to manipulate a flat film that acts as the transducer. The speaker housing is 3D printed and looks great but is otherwise unremarkable. The fun starts when a Dremel with a diamond disk cuts the magnets in half. Cutting neodymium poses several challenges. For example, if you heat the material up too much while cutting, it can lose its magnetism.\nWith the proper magnets, you can move to the tedious method of creating the coils. The post shows three different methods. But the part we really liked was using a resin 3D printer as a UV source to expose a resist mask which transfers to a copper or aluminum foil that will be the sound-generating film. [JGJMatt] used a similar technique to put resist on PC board blanks, too. Unfortunately, there were some issues so the finished speakers didnt use the foil prepared using this method. Instead, a quick modification to the resin printer allowed a thin film of resin to rest on the foil, which was then exposed.\nOnce you have the pieces, there isnt much left to do but put them together. Honestly, this is one of those things you probably wont do yourself unless you are obsessed with speakers. But there were a lot of interesting techniques here that might come in handy, even if you dont care about audio reproduction.\n[JGJMatt] showed us a ribbon speaker before. We have seen some speakers that are practically all 3D printed."}

It brings you 3D modeling, but not in a CAD way  instead, people commonly use it to create animations, movies, games, and even things like VR models. In short, Blender is about all things art and visual expression. Now, what if you want a breathtaking render of your KiCad board? Look no further than the pcb2blender tool from [Bobbe 30350n].\nThis isnt the first time weve seen KiCad meet Blender. However, compared to the KiCad to Blender paths that people used previously, pcb2blender makes the import process as straightforward and as quick as humanly possible. Install a plugin for both tools, and simply transfer a .pcb3d file out of the KiCad plugin into the Blender plugin. Want to make the surfaces of your design look like theyre meant to look in real life? Use the free2ki plugin to apply materials to your 3D models. In fact, you should check out [30350n]s Blender plugin collection and overall portfolio, its impressive.\nTheres no shortage of Blender hacks  just this year weve covered a hacker straight up simulating an entire camera inside Blender for the purpose of making renders, and someone else showing how to use Stable Diffusion to texture 3D scenes at lightning speed. We even recently published a comprehensive tutorial on how to animate your robot in Blender ourselves! Want to give it a shot? Check out this quick and simple Red Bull can model design tutorial.\nThanks to [Aki] for sharing this with us!", "title": "KiCad\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u8868\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eBlender\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059", "body": "Blender\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30923D\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cpcb2blender\u300d\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u3002KiCad\u3084\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["KiCad\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u8868\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eBlender\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059", "pcb2blender\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u3067KiCad\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092Blender\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30013D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u3088\u308a\u9bae\u3084\u304b\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046", "Blender\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Red Bull\u306e\u7f36\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\uff1f", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304cBlender\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u3053\u3068\u3092\u6210\u3057\u9042\u3052\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059"]}

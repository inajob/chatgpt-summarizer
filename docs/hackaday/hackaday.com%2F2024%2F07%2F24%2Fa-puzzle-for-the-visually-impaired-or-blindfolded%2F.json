It just needs to look a little different. Or, in this case, feel different.\n16-year-old [feazellecw] has come up with just the solution  a puzzle with pieces that have both a defining texture and a slant in the z-height to them. While there is no picture on the puzzle face to speak of, instead there is a satisfying end result. You could change it up and add a relief image if you wanted, as long as you still observed the diagonal lines, the z-slant, and the little hole in the bottom that helps differentiate it from the top.\nAs [feazellecw] says, its important to find a box to help keep the pieces together during assembly; a 3D-printed box would be a nice touch. Files for this 15-piece puzzle are available if youd like to make one for yourself or someone else, but just the idea might inspire you to make your own variant.\nDont like putting puzzles together? Build a robot to do it for you.", "title": "\u8996\u899a\u969c\u304c\u3044\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u89e6\u899a\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u76ee\u306e\u4e0d\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u4eba\u304c\u30b8\u30b0\u30bd\u30fc\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u306f\u306a\u3044\u300216\u6b73\u306e[feazellecw]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u89e6\u611f\u3084\u9ad8\u3055\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b8\u30b0\u30bd\u30fc\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u8003\u6848\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30c4\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u8a9e\u308b\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u6e80\u8db3\u611f\u304c\u3042\u308a\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306e\u3082\u304a\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002", "titles": ["\u8996\u899a\u969c\u304c\u3044\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u89e6\u899a\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "16\u6b73\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u304c\u8003\u6848\u3057\u305f\u89e6\u899a\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb", "\u8d85\u7acb\u4f53\u611f\u3068\u89e6\u899a\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5229\u7528", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3066\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u304b\u305b\u308b"]}

Compared to 5.x, it contains a number of changes and some new features, the most interesting probably being Channel Sounding. This builds upon existing features found in Bluetooth 5.x to determine the angle to, and direction of another device using Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD), but uses a new approach to much more precisely determine these parameters. as defined in the Technical Overview document for this feature.\nIn addition to this feature, there are also new ways to filter advertising packets, to reduce the number of packets to sift through (Decision-Based Advertising Filtering) and to filter out duplicate packets (Monitoring Advertisers). On a fundamental level, the Isochronous Adaptation Layer (ISOAL) received a new framing mode to reduce latency and increase reliability, alongside frame spacing now being negotiable and additional ways to exchange link layer information between devices.\nAs with any Bluetooth update, it will take a while before chipsets supporting it become widely available, and for the new features to be supported, but it gives a glimpse of what we can likely expect from Bluetooth-enabled devices in the future.", "title": "Bluetooth 6.0\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u4ed5\u69d8\u306e\u6982\u8981", "body": "Bluetooth SIG\u306f\u6700\u8fd1\u3001Bluetooth 6.0\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u4ed5\u69d8\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u3057\u3066Channel Sounding\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001Bluetooth 5.x\u3088\u308a\u89d2\u5ea6\u3084\u65b9\u5411\u3092\u3088\u308a\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u4ed6\u306b\u30d1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u3084latency\u4f4e\u6e1b\u306e\u6539\u5584\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Bluetooth\u6709\u52b9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u672a\u6765\u5c55\u671b\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Bluetooth 6.0\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u4ed5\u69d8\u306e\u6982\u8981", "Bluetooth 6.0\u3067\u306eChannel Sounding\u306e\u5c0e\u5165", "Bluetooth 6.0\u306e\u5e83\u544a\u30d1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u5909\u66f4", "Bluetooth 6.0\u306eIsochronous Adaptation Layer\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "Bluetooth 6.0\u306e\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd"]}

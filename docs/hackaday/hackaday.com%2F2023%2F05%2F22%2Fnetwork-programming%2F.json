[Comers] TCP/IP books are a great reference but sometimes is too low level. Unix Networking Programming by [Stevens] is the usual choice, but it is getting a little long in the tooth, as well. Now we have Beejs Guide to Network Programming Using Internet Sockets. While the title doesnt exactly roll off the tongue, the content is right on and fresh. Best part? You can read it now in your browser or in PDF format.\nAll the topics youd expect are there in ten chapters. Of course, theres the obligatory description of what a socket is and the types of sockets you commonly encounter. Then theres coverage of addressing and portability. Theres even a section on IPV6.\n\nAfter covering the most common socket API calls, there is a simple example. Then Chapter 7 covers slightly advanced techniques. That includes things like the select API call, partial sends, and broadcast packets. Chapter 9 is just man pages which are handy if you have the printed reference on an airplane. Overall, a good modern treatment of the topic.\nWhile the socket API originated at Berkely, just about every network stack looks the same more or less, so if you learn these calls, youll do fine on whatever operating system you like, including many microcontrollers.\nUsually, when we are looking at networking, our eyes are focused lower in the stack. But if you arent reverse engineering, the API is definitely the way to go.", "title": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8API\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "body": "\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001Comer\u306eTCP/IP\u306e\u672c\u3084Stevens\u306eUnix Networking Programming\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001Beej\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u306f\u65b0\u9bae\u3067\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u300210\u7ae0\u306b\u308f\u305f\u3063\u3066\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u4f8b\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u307e\u305f\u306fPDF\u3067\u8aad\u3081\u308b\u3002\u5404\u7a2eOS\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8API\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "Beej\u306e\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9 - \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066", "TCP/IP\u3092\u6271\u3046\u3082\u3063\u3068\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8API\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u5fdc\u7528\u307e\u3067\u306e\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3084\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8API\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9"]}

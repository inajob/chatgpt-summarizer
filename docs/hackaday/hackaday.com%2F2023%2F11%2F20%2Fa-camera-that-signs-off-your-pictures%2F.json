Apparently, products are starting to hit the market, and Spectrum reports on a Leica that, though it will set you back nearly $10,000, can produce pictures with cryptographic signatures.\nThis isnt something Leica made up. In 2019, a consortium known as the Content Authenticity Initiative set out to establish a standard for this sort of thing. The founders are no surprise: The New York Times, Adobe, and Twitter. There are 200 companies involved now, although Twitter  now X  has left.\nThe problem, the post notes, is that software support is limited. There are only a few programs that recognize and process digital signatures. Thatll change, of course, and  we imagine  if you needed to prove the provenance of a photo in court, youd just buy the right software you needed.\nWe havent dug into the technology, but presumably keeping the private key secure will be very important. The consortium is clear that the technology is not about managing rights, and it is possible to label a picture anonymously. The signature can identify if an image was taken with a camera or generated by AI and details about how it was taken. It also can detect any attempt to tamper with the image. Compliant programs can make modifications, but they will be traceable through the cryptographic record.\nWill it work? Probably. Can it be broken? We dont know, but we wouldnt bet that it couldnt without a lot more reading. PDF signatures can be hacked. Our experience is that not much is truly unhackable."}

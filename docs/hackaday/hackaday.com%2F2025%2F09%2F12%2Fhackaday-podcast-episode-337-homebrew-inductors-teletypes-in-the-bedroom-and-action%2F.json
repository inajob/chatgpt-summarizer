Get your fresh hot hacks right here! Elliot and Dan teamed up this week to go through every story published on our pages to find the best of the best, the cream of the crop, and serve them up hot and fresh for you. The news this week was all from space, with the ISS getting its latest push from Dragon, plus checks notes oh yeah, life on Mars. Well, maybe, but its looking more and more like we are not alone, or at least not a few million years ago.\nBut even if we are, plenty is still going on down here to keep you interested. Like homebrewing? Good, because we looked at DIY inductors, wire nuts, and even a dope  but nope  ultralight helicopter. Into retro? Weve got you covered with a loving look at IRC, a 60s bedside computer guaranteed to end your marriage, and a look at the best 8-bit language you never heard of.\nWe looked at a rescued fume hood, sensors galore on your phone, a rug that should have  and did, kind of  use a 555, and raytracing for the rest of your natural life. As for Cant Miss Articles, Elliot could barely contain himself with the bounty of projects written up by our Hackaday writers, not to mention Aryas deep dive into putting GPS modules to work in your builds.\n\nDownload this MP3, full of twisty little podcasts, all alike.

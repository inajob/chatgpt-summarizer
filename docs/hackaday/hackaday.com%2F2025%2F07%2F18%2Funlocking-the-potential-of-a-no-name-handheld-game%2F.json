A handheld gaming PC with hours of battery life, for example, would have been impossible or extremely expensive until recently. But this revolution has also enabled a swath of inexpensive but low-quality knockoff consoles, often running unlicensed games, that might not even reach the low bar of quality set by their sellers. [Jorisclayton] was able to modify one of these to live up to its original promises.\nThis Ultimate Brick Game, as it is called, originally didnt even boast the number of games, unlicensed or otherwise, that it claimed to. [Jorisclayton] removed almost all of the internals from this small handheld to help it live up to this original claim. It boasts a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W now as well as a TFT screen and has a number of other improvements including Bluetooth support for external controllers and upgraded audio. A second console was used for donor parts, and some case mods were made as well to accommodate a few extra buttons missing on the original console.\nRight now the project is in a prototype phase, as [Jorisclayton] is hoping to use the donor case to build a more refined version of this handheld console in the future. Until then, this first edition upgrade of the original console can run RetroPie, which means it can run most games up through the Nintendo 64 era. RetroPie enables a ton of emulation for old video games including arcade games of the past. This small arcade cabinet uses that software to bring back a bit of nostalgia for the arcade era.", "title": "- \u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0PC\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u6539\u826f\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0PC\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01Ultimate Brick Game\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- Bluetooth\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7", "- RetroPie\u3067\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

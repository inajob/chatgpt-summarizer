We started with surprising news about the rapidly approaching Supercon keynote; no spoilers, but Star Trek fans such as we who dont have tickets will be greatly disappointed.\nElliot waxed on about taking the poop out of your prints (not pants), Dan got into a camera that adds a dimension to its images, and we both delighted in the inner workings of an air-powered squishy robot.\nQuestions? Weve got plenty. Is it possible to take an X-ray without an X-ray tube? Or X-rays, for that matter? Did Lucille Ball crack a spy ring with her fillings? Is Algol set to take over the world? Whats inside a germanium transistor? How does a flipping fish say Happy Birthday? And how far down the Meshtastic rabbit hole did our own Tom Nardi fall? Tune in to find out the answers.\n\nDownload this free-range, cruelty-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 342 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2025 Hackaday Supercon: Crafting The Final Frontier Keynote Event\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [James Barker] for picking the sound of a rake!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nSLM Co-extruding Hotend Makes Poopless Prints\n\nI built a rotating mixing nozzle to print with different colors\n3D Printer with rotating nozzle\nGitHub  Heinz-Loepmeier/nozzleboss\nWaterjet-Cut Precision Pastry\n\n\nWaverider: Scanning Spectra One Pixel At A Time\n\nPi-Based Spectrometer Puts The Complexity In The Software\n\n\nMore Than 100 Sub-Circuit Designs From Texas Instruments\nThe Singing Dentures Of Manchester And Other Places\n\nHackaday Links: March 31, 2024 (Last item)\nMore Power: Powel Crosley And The Cincinnati Flamethrower\n\n\nPrinting An Air-Powered Integrated Circuit For Squishy Robots\nTubeless X-Ray Runs On Patience\n\nThis Scratch-Built X-Ray Tube Really Shines\nTo See Within: Making Medical X-rays\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nCould This Be The Year Of Algol?\nHow Bad Can A Cheap Knockoff ADS1115 ADC Be?\nRFIDisk: When Floppy Drives Go Contactless\nAttack Turns Mouse Into Microphone\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nToasty Subwoofer Limps Back To Life\nInside A Germanium Transistor\nBilly Bass Gets New Job As A Voice Assistant\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nRubik\u2019s WOWCube: What Really Makes A Toy?\nMeshtastic: A Tale Of Two Cities\n", "title": "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\uff1a\u4fbf\u5668\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u300d", "body": "\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3084\u7591\u554f\u3092\u8b70\u8ad6\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\uff1a\u4fbf\u5668\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u300d", "\u300c\u7a7a\u6c17\u5727\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30ad\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6570\u3005\u300d", "\u300c\u7121\u7ba1X\u7dda\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30ef\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u4e0a\u306eDIY\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u300d"]}

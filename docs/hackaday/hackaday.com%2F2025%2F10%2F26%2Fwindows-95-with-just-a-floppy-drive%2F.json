The original requirements were a 386 or better, 4 megabytes of memory, and a hard drive. [Roberts Retro] is exploding one of those requirements, creating a full Windows 95 install using only a floppy drive.\nAs you might imagine, even if you had one of the super-rare 2.88 megabyte drives, such a feat would require a few tricks. In this case the biggest trick is the FlashPath, a curious 1990s peripheral that allows a SmartMedia card to be used in a floppy drive. With a special DOS driver it allows what is in effect a 32 megabyte floppy disk, but even thats not enough for 95. In come a couple of further tricks, installing Windows 95 to a compressed DriveSpace volume which is copied to the FlashPath, and copying the Drivespace volume to a RAM drive and mounting it, on boot. It needs a conventional floppy to boot before swapping to the FlashPath and it seems the copying process is extremely slow, but wed expect Windows 95 from RAM to be very quick indeed.\nThere have been other minimalist Windows 95s over the years, but what makes this one unusual is that its a full install. Five years ago at the OSs quarter century we took a look at it with 2020 eyes, and tried gauge its effect on modern desktops.\n\n", "title": "- 32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1aWindows 95\u304c\u8fce\u3048\u305f30\u5e74", "body": "Windows 95\u306f\u767b\u5834\u304b\u308930\u5e74\u304c\u7d4c\u904e\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u307f\u3067\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- 32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1aWindows 95\u304c\u8fce\u3048\u305f30\u5e74", "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067Windows 95\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- FlashPath\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWindows 95\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5", "- RAM\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306b\u3088\u308bWindows 95\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u8d77\u52d5\u6280\u8853", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eWindows 95\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u8a66\u307f"]}

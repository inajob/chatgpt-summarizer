At one time, it was ubiquitous, and many authors had a hard time giving it up. Some, like George R. R. Martin, apparently are still refusing to give it up. But most of us have moved on. Thanks to an open-source clone, WordTsar, you may not have to. This is a modern interpretation of our old friend.\nProgrammers that write were especially fond of WordStar since it had a non-document mode and was often the best text editor you had available for writing code. Being able to do your documentation without switching brain gears is useful, too. Touch typists love the efficiency of easy control of things without resorting to cursor keys or a mouse  the same thing vi and emacs fans enjoy but in a different way.\nThe software runs on multiple platforms and has some new features. Installation on Linux is easy because it is packaged in an AppImage file. Of course, you can also fire up your best CP/M machine, replica, or emulation and run the real WordStar, but  honestly  WordTsar seems more practical if you wanted to go back to using this kind of wordprocessor or editor for everyday use.\nOf course, some word processors were actual hardware. If you want some cheap CP/M hardware, thats easy enough, too.", "title": "\u300cWordTsar\u300d\u2015 WordStar\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc", "body": "Wordstar\u306f\u3001\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8ca9\u58f2\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u3001\u4e00\u6642\u306f\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001WordTsar\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u518d\u3073\u4f7f\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002WordStar\u306f\u3001\u975e\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a18\u8ff0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001WordTsar\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u3067\u3001Linux\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cWordTsar\u300d\u2015 WordStar\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc", "WordStar\u2015\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u8ca9\u58f2\u4fc3\u9032\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5", "WordStar\u304b\u3089\u6d3e\u751f\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cWordTsar\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30b9\u30c8\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u300cWordStar\u300d\u3068\u300cWordTsar\u300d\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "WordStar\u2015\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4f5c\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u304c\u624b\u653e\u305b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5"]}

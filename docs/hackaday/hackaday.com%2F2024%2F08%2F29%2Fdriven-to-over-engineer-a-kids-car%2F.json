And [Jon Petter Skagmo] just laid down a new gauntlet  the incredibly overly-engineered kids car.\nWhile the original plan was to build the entire car from scratch, [Jon] eventually opted to use an off-the-shelf car that had a dead battery.\nWhile the original architecture was quite simple, the new hardware has just about everything a kid could want in a tricked-out ride, most of which is accessible through the really cool dashboard.\nWere talking headlights, a music player, a siren, a selfie video cam that doubles as two-way communication with the driver, and even a garage door opener that uses an MQTT connection.\nUnder the cute little hood is where youll find most of the electronics. The cars brain is a Raspberry Pi 3B, and theres a custom daughter board that includes GPS/GNSS. This was originally meant to geofence [Baby Girl Skagmo] in, but Dad quickly realized that kids are gonna kid and disabled it pretty soon after.\nThis isnt the first high-tech rebuild of a kiddie car that weve seen here at Hackaday. Makes us wish we were quite a bit smaller\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba\u30ab\u30fc\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u96fb\u5b50\u8eca\u4e21", "body": "\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u306e\u8eca\u3092\u904e\u5270\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3001\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3067\u904b\u8ee2\u3059\u308b\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u8907\u6570\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3084\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3001GPS\u3001MQTT\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba\u30ab\u30fc\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u96fb\u5b50\u8eca\u4e21", "Raspberry Pi\u642d\u8f09\uff1a\u5b50\u4f9b\u5411\u3051\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u96fb\u5b50\u8eca\u4e21", "\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1a\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba\u30ab\u30fc", "\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u642d\u8f09\uff1a\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u8eca\u4e21DIY", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u89aa\uff1a\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u96fb\u5b50\u8eca\u4e21"]}

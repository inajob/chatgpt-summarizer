And [Jon Petter Skagmo] just laid down a new gauntlet  the incredibly overly-engineered kids car.\nWhile the original plan was to build the entire car from scratch, [Jon] eventually opted to use an off-the-shelf car that had a dead battery.\nWhile the original architecture was quite simple, the new hardware has just about everything a kid could want in a tricked-out ride, most of which is accessible through the really cool dashboard.\nWere talking headlights, a music player, a siren, a selfie video cam that doubles as two-way communication with the driver, and even a garage door opener that uses an MQTT connection.\nUnder the cute little hood is where youll find most of the electronics. The cars brain is a Raspberry Pi 3B, and theres a custom daughter board that includes GPS/GNSS. This was originally meant to geofence [Baby Girl Skagmo] in, but Dad quickly realized that kids are gonna kid and disabled it pretty soon after.\nThis isnt the first high-tech rebuild of a kiddie car that weve seen here at Hackaday. Makes us wish we were quite a bit smaller\n\n"}

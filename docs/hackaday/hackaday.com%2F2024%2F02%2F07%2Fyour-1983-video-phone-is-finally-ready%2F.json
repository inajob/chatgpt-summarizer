You know, like the one that appears on the cover of the magazine. Of course, you cant. But that didnt stop former Hackaday luminary [Cameron] from duplicating the mythical device, if not precisely, then in spirit. Check it out in the video, below.\nThe Byte Magazine Cover in Question!\nWhile the original Byte article was about VideoTex, [Cameron] built a device with even more capability you couldnt have dreamed of in 1983. Whats more, the build was simple. He started with an old analog phone and a tiny Android phone. A 3D-printed faceplate lets the fake phone serve as a sort of dock for the cellular device.\nThats not all, though. Using the guts of a Bluetooth headset enables the fake phones handset. Now you can access the web  sort of a super Videotex system. You can even make video calls.\nThere isnt a lot of detail about the build, but you probably dont need it. This is more of an art project, and your analog phone, cell phone, and Bluetooth gizmo will probably be different anyway.\nEveryone always wanted a video phone, and while we sort of have them now, it doesnt quite seem the same as we imagined them. We wish [Cameron] would put an app on the phone to simulate a rotary dial and maybe even act as an answering machine.\n\n"}

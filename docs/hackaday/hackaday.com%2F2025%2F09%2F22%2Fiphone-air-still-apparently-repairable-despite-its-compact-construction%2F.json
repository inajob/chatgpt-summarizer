For a while, our phones were all getting smaller, then they started getting bigger again as screens expanded to show us ever more content and advertising. The iPhone air is going back the other way, with a design that aims to sell based on its slimness. [iFixit] reckons that despite its diminutive dimensions, it should still be quite repairable.\nThinner usually means flimsier, harder to fix, and more glued-down parts, but the iPhone Air proves otherwise, states Elizabeth Chamberlain for the repair outlet. Much of this comes down to clever design, that makes repair possible at the same time as ensuring compactness. A big part of this is the way that Apple made the bottom half of the phone pretty much just battery. Most of the actual electronic components are on a logic board up by the camera. Segmenting the phone in this way makes it easier to access commonly-replaced parts like the battery without having to pull a lot of other parts out of the way first.\n[iFixit] refers to this as flattening the disassembly tree\u2014minimizing the number of components you have to touch to replace what youre there to fix. In this regard, the thinness of the iPhone Air is actually a boon. The phone is so thin, it wasnt possible to stack multiple components on top of each other, so everything is easier to get to. The design is also reasonably modular, which should make routine repairs like USB C port swaps relatively straightforward.\nWhatever smartphone youre working on, it often helps to have a disassembly guide to ensure you dont wreck it when youre trying to fix something. [iFixit] remains a stellar resource in that regard. \n", "title": "- iPhone Air\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3055", "body": "iPhone Air\u306f\u8584\u578b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306a\u304c\u3089\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u4ea4\u63db\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u512a\u308c\u305f\u4fee\u7406\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- iPhone Air\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3055", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u306e\u9006\u8ee2\uff01iPhone Air\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u308b\uff01iPhone Air\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u8584\u3055\u304c\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\uff1fiPhone Air\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u7406\u5ff5", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308biFixit\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

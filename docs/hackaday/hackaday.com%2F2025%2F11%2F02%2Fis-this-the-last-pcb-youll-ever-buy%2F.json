If youre mailing off to China for your PCBs, its shockingly quick for what it is, but a one-week turnaround is not rapid prototyping. [Stephen Hawes] has been on a quest on his YouTube channel for the ideal rapid-prototyping PCB solution, and he thinks hes finally got it.\nNow, if youre only doing single-layer PCBs, this is a solved problem. You can mechanically mill, or laser cut, or chemically etch your way to PCB perfection, far faster than the Chinese fabs can get you a part. If you want a double-sided board, however, vias are both a pain in the keister to do yourself, and a rate-limiting step.\n[Stephen Hawes] hit on the idea of buying a bulk set of PCBs from the usual vendors. The boards will be simple copper pours with vias in a grid with just a bit of etching. PCB Vendors are good at that, after all, and its not going to cost much more than raw copper. [Stephen] then uses the template of this viagrid board to lay out the circuit hes prototyping, and its off to the races.\nOr, off to the laser, rather. Unlike the fiber laser he showed us previously, [Stephen] is now recommending a diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser, as they can blast the copper off without burning FR4 substrate. Given that the vias are now part of the design, everything needs to line up perfectly, so his viagrid PCB design has a few features to lock it in using LightBurns frame feature. The DPSS laser barely shows up on the copper, but shines brilliantly off the fiberglass, and VIGrid takes advantage of this fact. Hes also got a 3D printed jig to hold everything in alignment once its dialed in, even for running off many boards.\nThis laser is just as fast as the fiber laser, giving you PCBs in minutes. And while vias are apparently best left to the professionals, through-hole components can easily be accommodated, with the laser able to cut the FR4 on request. All of his lightburn and files for the varigrid PCB are available on GitHub. [Stephen] is also looking for collaborators to see if this technique can be used without the very-expensive Commarker laser, and to come up with a better name than varigrid.\nAs [Stephen] says in the video, if you combine this with a pick-and-place and a reflow oven, you can go from design to a working two-layer PCB in about 90 minutes, which is a very exciting prospect for engineering companies and maker-spaces alike. Words like game-changing get thrown around a lot, but this just might warrant it, at least for those who have a need for speed and can afford the tools.\nWhat do you think? Is viagrid the rapid-prototyping revolution weve been waiting for, or is the headline of this article still subject to Betteridges Law?\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip.\n<!--more-->\n"}

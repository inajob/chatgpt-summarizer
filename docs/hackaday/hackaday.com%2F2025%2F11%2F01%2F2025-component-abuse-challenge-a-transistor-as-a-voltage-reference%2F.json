[Ken Yap]s use of a transistor base-emitter junction as a voltage reference certainly fits into the latter category.\nIf you forward bias\u00a0 a base-emitter junction, it will behave as a diode, which could be used as a roughly 0.7 volt reference. But this project is far more fun than that, because it runs the junctions in reverse biased breakdown mode. Using one of those cheap grab bags of transistor seconds, he finds that devices of the same type maintain the same voltage, which for the NPN devices he has works out at 9.5 volts and the PNP at 6.5. Were told it damages their operation as transistors, but with a grab bag, thats not quite the issue.\nWeve got a few days left before the end of the contest, and were sure you can think of something worth entering. Why not give it a go!\n \n\n\n", "title": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5727\u57fa\u6e96\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "body": "2025\u5e74\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u4e71\u7528\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3067\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u9762\u767d\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5727\u57fa\u6e96\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306a\u8aa4\u7528\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7d50\u679c", "\u9006\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u52d5\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "2025\u5e74\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u60aa\u7528\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

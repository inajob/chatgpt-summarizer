Not just any business card: a PCB business card. Not just any PCB business card: a PCB business card that can play pong.\n[Colin] was heavily inspired by the card [Ben Eater] was handing out at OpenSauce last year, and openly admits to copying the button holder from it. We cant blame him: the routed-out fingers to hold a lithium button cell were a great idea. The original idea, a 3D persistence-of-vision display, was a little too ambitious to fit on a business card, so [Colin] repurposed the 64 LED matrix and STM32 processor to play Pong. Aside from the LEDs and the microprocessor, it looks like the board has a shift register to handle all those outputs and a pair of surface-mount buttons.\nOf course you cant get two players on a business card, so the microprocessor is serving as the opponent. With only 64 LEDs, theres no room for score-keeping  but apparently even the first, nonworking prototype was good enough to get [Colin] a job, so not only can we not complain, we offer our congratulations.\nThe video is a bit short on detail, but [Colin] promises a PCB-business card tutorial at a later date. If you cant wait for that, or just want to see other hackers take on the same idea, take a gander at some of the entries to last years Business Card Challenge.\n", "title": "\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u306aPCB\u540d\u523a\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b66\u751f", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u5b66\u751f\u30b3\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e3\u30af\u30bd\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u30dd\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308bPCB\u540d\u523a\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u5c31\u8077\u6d3b\u52d5\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u306aPCB\u540d\u523a\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b66\u751f", "Colin Jackson\u304c\u624b\u639b\u3051\u305fLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u540d\u523a\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u540d\u523a\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "PCB\u540d\u523a\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u5c31\u8077\u306e\u6210\u529f\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u540d\u523a\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

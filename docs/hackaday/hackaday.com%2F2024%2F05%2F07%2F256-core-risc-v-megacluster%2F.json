But what if that wasnt the case? [bitluni] shows us how its done with his 256-core RISC-V megacluster.\nWhile the CH32V family of microcontrollers its based on arent nearly as powerful as what youd traditionally find in a supercomputer, [bitluni] does use them to demonstrate a property of supercomputers: many, many cores doing the same task in parallel.\nTo recap our previous coverage, a single supercluster is made from 16 CH32V003 microcontrollers connected to each other with an 8-bit bus, with an LED on each and the remaining pins to an I/O expander. The megacluster is in turn made from 16 of these superclusters, which are put in pairs on 8 blades with a CH32V203 per square as a bridge between the supercluster and the main 8-bit bus of the megacluster, controlled by one last CH32V203.\n[bitluni] goes into detail about designing PCBs that break KiCad, managing an overcrowded bus with 16 participants, culminating in a mesmerizing showcase of blinking LEDs showing that RC oscillators arent all that accurate.\n\n", "title": "256\u30b3\u30a2RISC-V\u30e1\u30ac\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306f\u666e\u901a\u306e\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u624b\u306e\u5c4a\u304b\u306a\u3044\u5b58\u5728\u3060\u304c\u3001[bitluni]\u6c0f\u306f256\u30b3\u30a2\u306eRISC-V\u30e1\u30ac\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u4e26\u5217\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u3092LED\u3067\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3002\u54048\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30d0\u30b9\u3067\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3001PCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3084\u30d0\u30b9\u7ba1\u7406\u3082\u8a73\u7d30\u306b\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["256\u30b3\u30a2RISC-V\u30e1\u30ac\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "bitluni\u306b\u3088\u308bLED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f256\u30b3\u30a2RISC-V\u30e1\u30ac\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u8d85\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f16\u500b\u306eCH32V\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "KiCad\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fPCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac", "RC\u767a\u632f\u5668\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3092\u793a\u3059LED\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9"]}

Here in Europe that means its the turn of the British hackers to have the years large event, in the form of the latest incarnation of Electromagnetic Field. Well be there, camera and microphone in hand, and with luck well be able to bring you a flavour of the event.\nThe atmosphere that comes from being in the company of several thousand like minds is stimulating enough, but what makes these outdoor events special is that the villages become so much more than simply a group of geeks at a table with their laptops. Where else can one find a tea room run by a hackerspace except courtesy of MK Makerspace, or a fully functional pop-up motor racing circuit from Hacky Racers?\nThis years event badge is an interesting one, the ESP43-S3 powered and hexagon-shaped Tildagon. Its a bold attempt to redefine the event badge away from a one-off trinket into one that lasts across multiple events, with custom Hexpansions like the petals on a flower, intended to have new ones appear on an event by event basis.\nIf youre going to be at EMF then maybe we can join you for a pint, otherwise well be bringing you the best that we find there. To whet your appetite, heres something of the last one.", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba\u30f3\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306eElectromagnetic Field\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba\u30f3\u304c\u5230\u6765\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304cElectromagnetic Field\u3067\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u958b\u50ac\u3002\u6570\u5343\u4eba\u306e\u540c\u5fd7\u3068\u96c6\u3046\u4e2d\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u5e74\u306e\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304a\u5c4a\u3051\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba\u30f3\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306eElectromagnetic Field\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u300cElectromagnetic Field\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u300cTildagon\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u5f62\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306eHexpansions\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u4f53\u9a13"]}

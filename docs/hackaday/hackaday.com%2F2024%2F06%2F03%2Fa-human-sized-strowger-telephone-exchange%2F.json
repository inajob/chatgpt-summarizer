Better still, this wasnt the huge array of racks weve come to expect from a mechanical exchange, but a single human-sized unit, maybe on a similar scale to a large refrigerator. [LBPK]s PAX, or Private Automatic Exchange, is a private telephone network, 1950s style.\nIt stood at the back of the container, with a row of four telephones in front of it. We particularly liked the angular Trimphone, the height of 1960s and 70s chic. You could dial the other phones in the network with a two digit number, and watch the exchange clicking in the background as you did so. Some of the sounds werent quite the same as the full-sized equivalents, with the various tones being replaced by vibrating reeds.\nThis exchange has an interesting history, being\u00a0built in 1956 by Automatic Telephone  Electric for the Midlands Electricity Board, power generator for much of central England, where it served its commercial life. On decommissioning it went to the Ffestiniog narrow gauge railway, in Wales. He was lucky enough to learn of its existence when the Ffestiniog had no further use for it, and snapped it up.\nWe have to admit, we want one of these, however he makes clear that its an unwieldy machine that requires quite some attention so a Hackaday mechanical exchange will have to remain a dream for now."}

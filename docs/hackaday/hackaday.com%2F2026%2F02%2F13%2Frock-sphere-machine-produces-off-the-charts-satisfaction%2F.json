Well, all that is in the past in light of the fabulous results from his self-built Rock Sphere Machine! Turns out that its neither costly to make such a machine, nor particularly time-consuming to create the spheres once things are dialed in. The video is a journey of the very first run of the machine, and its a great tour.\nThe resulting sphere? Super satisfying to hold and handle. The surface is beyond smooth, with an oil-like glossy shine that is utterly dry to the touch.\nThe basic concept  that of three cordless drills in tension  is adapted from existing designs, but the implementation is all his own. First a rough-cut rock is held between three diamond bits. The drills turn at 100 RPM while a simple water reservoir drips from above. After two hours, theres a fair bit of slurry and the rock has definitely changed.\n[Michigan Rocks] moves on to polishing, which uses the same setup but with progressively-finer grinding pads in place of the cutting bits. This part is also really clever, because the DIY polishing pads are great hacks in and of themselves. Theyre made from little more than PVC pipe end caps with hex bolts as shafts. The end caps are filled with epoxy and topped with a slightly concave surface of hook-and-loop fastener. By doing this, he can cut up larger fuzzy-backed polishing pads and stick the pieces to his drill-mounted holders as needed, all the way down to 6000 grit. He shows everything about the pads at the 11:55 mark, and its an approach worth keeping in mind.\nWhat is the end result like? See for yourself, but we think [Michigan Rocks] sums it up when he says I wish you could feel this thing, it feels so smooth. Its so satisfying to roll around in your hands. Im so happy I made this machine. This is awesome.\nWeve seen machines for making wooden spheres but this one makes fantastic use of repurposed stuff like inexpensive cordless drills, and the sort of wood structures anyone with access to hand tools can make.\n\n\nThanks to [AloofPenny] for the tip."}

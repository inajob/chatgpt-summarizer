Whether its poor build quality or a general lack of support or updates, there are quite a few things on the market not worth anyones time or money. [Jonathan] was recently handed just such a peripheral, a toy game controller originally meant for a small child, but upon further inspection it turned into a surprisingly hackable platform, capable of plenty of IoT-type tasks.\nThe controller itself was easily disassembled, and the functional buttons within were wired to a Wemos D1 Mini instead of the originally-planned ESP32 because of some wiring irregularities and the fact that the Wemos D1 Mini having the required amount of I/O. Its still small enough to be sealed back inside the controller as well, powered by the batteries that would have powered the original controller.\nFor the software, [Jonathan] is using MQTT to register button presses with everything easily accessible over Wi-Fi, also making it possible to update the software wirelessly. He was able to use it to do a few things as proof-of-concept, including playing a game in PyGame and controlling a Sonos speaker, but for now hes using it to control an LED sculpture. With something this easily modified, though, it would be pretty straightforward to use it instead for a home automation remote control, especially since it is already set up to use MQTT.\n\n", "title": "\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\uff01\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u3001IoT\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002MQTT\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Wi-Fi\u7d4c\u7531\u3067\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u62bc\u4e0b\u3092\u767b\u9332\u3057\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7121\u7dda\u3067\u66f4\u65b0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002LED\u5f6b\u523b\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u306a\u3069\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\uff01\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30de\u30cb\u30a2\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u5b50\u4f9b\u5411\u3051\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u6539\u9020\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "IoT\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5236\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "Wi-Fi\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fLED\u30b9\u30ab\u30eb\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u8853", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

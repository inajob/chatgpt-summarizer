They sure like to bark, dont they? [rrustvold]s dog likes to bark at the door when a package arrives. Or when someone walks by the house, or whenever the mood strikes, really. To solve the barking issue, at least near the front door, [rrustvold] built a spray bottle turret to teach the dog through classical conditioning.\nAs you can see from the image, its all about pulling the trigger on a standard spray bottle at the right time. This machine only sprays when two conditions are met: it hears noise (like barking) and detects motion (like overzealous tail wagging). It also has heat-seeking abilities thanks to a Raspberry Pi thermal camera.\nTo do the actual spraying, theres a DC motor mounted behind the bottle which turns a pulley thats mounted to its shaft. Around the pulley is a string that wraps around the spray bottles trigger. To complete the build, everything is mounted on a lazy Susan so theres nowhere for Fido to hide-o.\nIf youve a dog whose bite is worse than its bark, consider building a custom dog door to keep it out of the cat box.\nThe 2024 Home Sweet Home Automation contest has officially wrapped  were counting the votes now, so stay tuned for an announcement about the winners shortly.\n \n\n", "title": "\u72ac\u306e\u5420\u3048\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308bDIY\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "\u72ac\u306e\u5420\u3048\u308b\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001rrustvold\u306f\u6577\u5730\u8fd1\u304f\u306b\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u30bf\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002\u97f3\u3084\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3057\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u5674\u5c04\u3002\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u30022024\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u8fd1\u65e5\u767a\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["\u72ac\u306e\u5420\u3048\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308bDIY\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ac\u3078\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0", "DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u72ac\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u30c9\u30a2\u3092DIY\u3057\u3066\u72ac\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6d88"]}

In [Professor Bardal]s case, its a couple of motorcycle batteries and a roll of flux-core wire, and not much else.\nWe suspect this one is going to elicit quite a few comments, not least by the welding fans who no doubt will be triggered by just about everything in the video below, especially by characterizing this as MIG welding; its FCAW, or flux-core arc welding. But it bears some superficial similarities to MIG, at least insofar as theres a consumable wire electrode through which a high-current DC supply flows, creating enough heat to melt it and the base metal. In this case, the current is provided by a pair of 12-volt motorcycle batteries hooked together in series. Theres also a torch of sorts  a short length of copper capillary tubing with a 1-mm inside diameter clamped in the jaws of a stick welder stinger, or a pair of locking pliers if youre really in a pinch. The torch is connected to the negative terminal on the battery with a jumper cable, and the positive terminal is connected to the workpiece.\nTo create the weld, a piece of 0.8-mm flux-core welding wire is threaded through the capillary and into the joint, and fed by hand as its consumed. Its awkward and awful, but it works. Of course, theres no control over amperage as there would be with a legit welding machine, which would make it hard to adapt this method to different materials. Weld quality appears poor, too. But we suspect that if you were in a position to need a welder like this, you wouldnt really care about any of that.\nFabricobbled welding rigs seem to be [Professor Bardal]s thing  witness this much more professional MIG welder, complete with a baking soda and vinegar shielding gas generator.\n\n\nThanks to [Danjovic] for the tip.", "title": "\u7dca\u6025\u6642\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u6eb6\u63a5\uff1a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "\u30d0\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u6559\u6388\u306f\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u7c21\u6613\u6eb6\u63a5\u3092\u884c\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u7dca\u6025\u6642\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u6eb6\u63a5\uff1a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u88fd\u4f5c\u73fe\u5834\u306e\u77e5\u6075\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u6eb6\u63a5\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u6eb6\u63a5\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u6eb6\u63a5\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u6027", "\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u3064\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5373\u5e2d\u6eb6\u63a5\u6cd5"]}

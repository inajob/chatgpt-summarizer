(Credit: YKK)\nAt first glance the very idea of a zipper that unzips and zips up by itself seems somewhat ridiculous. After all, these contraptions are mostly used on pieces of clothing and gear where handling a zipper isnt really sped up by having an electric motor sluggishly move through the rows of interlocking teeth. Of course, thats not the goal of YKK, which is the worlds largest manufacturer of zip fasteners. The demonstrated prototype (original PR in Japanese) shows this quite clearly, with a big tent and equally big zipper that youd be hard pressed to zip up by hand.\nThe basic application is thus more in industrial applications and similar, with one of the videos, embedded below, showing a large air tent being zipped up automatically after demonstrating why for a human worker this would be an arduous task. While this prototype appears to be externally powered, adding a battery or such could make it fully wireless and potentially a real timesaver when setting up large structures such as these. Assuming the battery isnt flat, of course.\nIt might conceivably be possible to miniaturize this technology to the point where itd ensure that no fly is ever left unzipped, and school kids can show off their new self-zipping jacket to their friends. This would of course have to come with serious safety considerations, as anyone who has ever had a bit of their flesh caught in a zipper can attest to.\n\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/news/656535/ykk-self-propelled-zipper-prototype\nhttps://www.ykk.com/newsroom/g_news/2025/20250424.html", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044YKK\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc\u6280\u8853", "body": "YKK\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u30b8\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306f\u7523\u696d\u5411\u3051\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u624b\u52d5\u306e\u624b\u9593\u3092\u524a\u6e1b\u3002\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u3067\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044YKK\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc\u6280\u8853", "\u5927\u578b\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u81ea\u8d70\u5f0f\u30b8\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u529b", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30b8\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\uff1a\u7523\u696d\u7528\u304b\u3089\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u307e\u3067", "\u81ea\u52d5\u30b8\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306b\u898b\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30b8\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

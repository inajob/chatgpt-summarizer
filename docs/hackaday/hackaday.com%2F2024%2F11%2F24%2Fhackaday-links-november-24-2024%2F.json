If the name doesnt ring a bell, thats understandable, because the man behind the first computer BBS wasnt much for the spotlight. Along with Randy Suess and in response to the Blizzard of 78, which kept their Chicago computer club from meeting in person, Christensen created an electronic version of a community corkboard. Suess worked on the hardware while Christensen provided the software, leveraging his XMODEM file-sharing protocol. They dubbed their creation a bulletin board system and when the idea caught on, they happily shared their work so that other enthusiasts could build their own systems.\n\nBBSs were the only show in town for a long time, and the happy little modem negotiation tones were like a doorbell you rang to get into a club where people understood your obsession. Perhaps its just the BBS nostalgia talking, but despite the functional similarities to todays social media, the BBS experience seemed a lot more civilized. Its not that people were much better behaved back then; any BBS regular can tell you there were plenty of jerks online then, too. But the general tone of BBS life was a little more sedate, probably due in part to the glacial pace of dial-up connections. Even at a screaming 2,400 baud, characters scrolled across your screen slower than you could read them, and that seemed to have a sedating effect on your passions. By the time someones opinion on the burning issues of the day had finally been painted on your monitor, youd had a bit of time to digest it and perhaps cool down a bit before composing a reply. We still had our flame wars, of course, but it was like watching slow-motion warfare and the dynamic was completely different from todays Matrix.\nSpeaking of yearning for a probably mythical Golden Age, Casio has announced a smart ring that looks like a miniature version of their classic sports chronograph wristwatch. The ring celebrates Casios 50th anniversary of making watches, and features a stainless steel case made by metal injection molding. The six-digit LCD is pretty limited in what it can display, and the ring doesnt do much other than tell the time and date and sound alarms. So were not sure where the smarts are here, except for the looks, of course.\nWe got a tip recently on a series of really interesting videos that you might want to check out, especially if youre into EMC simulations. Panires channel is chock full of videos showing how to use openEMS, the open-source electromagnetic field solver, with KiCad EDA software to simulate the RF properties of high-speed circuits. Hes got some in-depth videos on getting things set up plus some great tutorials on creating simulations that let you see how your PCB designs are radiating, allowing you to make changes and see the results right away. Very useful stuff, and pretty fun to look at, too.\nHere at Hackaday, we get a surprising and disappointingly regular stream of projects that claim to finally have beaten the laws of thermodynamics. So the words Perpetual Motion are especially triggering to us, but we instantly put that aside when we saw the title card on this video about the Atmos Clock. No, its not perpetual motion, but since as the name suggests, being powered by atmospheric pressure and temperature changes, its about as close as you can get. We remember one of these beautiful timepieces on the mantle in our grandparents house, gifted to Grampy for years of faithful service by his employer. It was a delicate machine and fascinating to watch work, which it only briefly did once we grandkids got near it. Still, watching how the mechanism worked is pretty interesting stuff.\n\nAnd finally, if you havent checked out The Analog, you really should. Its a weekly newsletter written by our friend Mihir Shah and is full of interesting tidbits from the world of electronics and technology. This time around he gifted us with a video that looks inside optical sorting in food processing. Youve probably seen these in action before, where cascades of objects  grapes in this case, obviously in a winery  are spread out on a high-speed conveyor belt under the watchful gaze of a computer vision system, which spots the bad grapes and yeets them into oblivion with a precisely controlled jet of compressed air. The mind boggles on the control loops needed to get the jet and the bad grape to meet up at just the right time so that good grapes stay in the game.\n", "title": "- \u521d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfBBS\u306e\u5275\u8a2d\u8005\u3001\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u6c0f\u306e\u8ffd\u60bc", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfBBS\u306e\u5275\u59cb\u8005\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u304c\u6b7b\u53bb\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u696d\u7e3e\u3084BBS\u306e\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3055\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u6280\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u521d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfBBS\u306e\u5275\u8a2d\u8005\u3001\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u6c0f\u306e\u8ffd\u60bc", "- \u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u306e\u65b0\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u56de\u8def\u306eEMC\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u5927\u6c17\u306e\u5909\u5316\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u300c\u30a2\u30c8\u30e2\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u9031\u520a\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ec\u30bf\u30fc\u300cThe Analog\u300d\u3067\u898b\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3068\u98df\u7269\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u30bd\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853"]}

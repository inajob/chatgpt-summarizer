Researchers in Massachusetts have found a non-surgical way to spay cats that will help these efforts.\nA single dose of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) gene therapy suppresses ovarian follicle formation, essentially turning off the ovulation cycle. After following the test cats for two years, none had kittens, unlike the cats in the control group. Other major hormones like estrogen were unaffected in the cats and they didnt exhibit any negative side effects. The researchers said it will be some time before the treatment can be widely deployed, but it offers hope for helping our internet overlords and the environs they terrorize inhabit.\nFor those of you doing TNR work, you might want to try this trap alert system to let you know youve caught a cat for spaying or neutering. If youd rather use a cat treat dispenser to motivate your code monkeys, then check out this hack."}

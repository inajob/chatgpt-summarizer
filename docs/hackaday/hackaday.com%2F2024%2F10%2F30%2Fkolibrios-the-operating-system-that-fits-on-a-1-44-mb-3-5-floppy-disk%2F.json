Unlike MenuetOS proprietary x86_64 version, theres no 64-bit in KolibriOS, but at this level you probably wont miss it.\nIn the video by [Michael], the OS boots incredibly fast off both a 3.5 floppy and a CD-ROM, with the CD-ROM version having the advantage of more software being provided with it, including shareware versions of DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D.\nAlthough web browsers (e.g. Netsurf) are also provided, [Michael] did not get Ethernet working, though he doesnt say whether he checked the hardware compatibility list. Quite a few common 3Com, Intel and Realtek NICs are supported out of the box.\nFor audio it was a similar story, with the hardware compatibility left unverified after audio was found to be not working. Despite this, the OS was fast, stable, runs DOOM smoothly and overall seems to be a great small OS for x86 platforms that could give an old system a new lease on life.\n\n", "title": "- KolibriOS: 1.44MB\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u8efd\u91cfOS", "body": "KolibriOS\u306fx86\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3067\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u8efd\u91cf\u306aOS\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u304b\u3089\u8d77\u52d5\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- KolibriOS: 1.44MB\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u8efd\u91cfOS", "- x86\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u305fKolibriOS\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u306f", "- \u53e4\u3044PC\u3092\u8607\u751f\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff01KolibriOS\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u8efd\u5feb\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bKolibriOS\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u4f53\u9a13", "- DOOM\u3082\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u52d5\u304f\uff01KolibriOS\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc"]}

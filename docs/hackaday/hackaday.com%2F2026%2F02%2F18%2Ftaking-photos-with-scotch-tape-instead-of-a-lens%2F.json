However, [okooptics] is here to show us theres another way\u2014using Scotch tape in place of a typical lens element.\nIf you just put Scotch tape over an image sensor without a lens, youll just get a blurry image, whatever you point it at. With the right algorithms, though, its possible to recover an image from that mess, using special lensless imaging techniques. In particular, [okooptics] shows how to recreate the so-called coded aperture techniques which were previously demonstrated in [Laura Waller]s DiffuserCam paper.\nIts complicated stuff, but the video does a great job of breaking down the optics into understandable chunks. Armed with a Raspberry Pi HQ camera covered in a small amount of Scotch and electrical tape, [okooptics] is able to reconstruct a viable image from what initially looks like a blurry mess of nothingness, with the aid of the right deconvolution maths. Its all about understanding the point spread function of the tape versus a regular lens, and figuring out how to fight off noise when reconstructing the image.\nWeve featured previous work from [okooptics] before, too, like this impressive demonstration of light transport and reconstruction. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c1\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306a\u3057\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u64ae\u5f71\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "body": "\u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c1\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u30ec\u30b9\u753b\u50cf\u53d6\u5f97\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u7279\u6b8a\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3067\u307c\u3084\u3051\u305f\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c1\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306a\u3057\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u64ae\u5f71\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u753b\u50cf\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u6280\u8853", "- \u753b\u50cf\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u5149\u5b66", "- \u307c\u3084\u3051\u305f\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5b9f\u6f14\u3068\u5fdc\u7528"]}

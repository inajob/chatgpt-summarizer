However, [okooptics] is here to show us theres another way\u2014using Scotch tape in place of a typical lens element.\nIf you just put Scotch tape over an image sensor without a lens, youll just get a blurry image, whatever you point it at. With the right algorithms, though, its possible to recover an image from that mess, using special lensless imaging techniques. In particular, [okooptics] shows how to recreate the so-called coded aperture techniques which were previously demonstrated in [Laura Waller]s DiffuserCam paper.\nIts complicated stuff, but the video does a great job of breaking down the optics into understandable chunks. Armed with a Raspberry Pi HQ camera covered in a small amount of Scotch and electrical tape, [okooptics] is able to reconstruct a viable image from what initially looks like a blurry mess of nothingness, with the aid of the right deconvolution maths. Its all about understanding the point spread function of the tape versus a regular lens, and figuring out how to fight off noise when reconstructing the image.\nWeve featured previous work from [okooptics] before, too, like this impressive demonstration of light transport and reconstruction. Video after the break.\n\n"}

Starting with the NHS in England, the therapy will be offered to the approximately 460 \u03b2 thalassemia patients in that part of the UK at seven different NHS centers within the coming weeks.\nWe previously covered this therapy and the way that it might offer a one-time treatment to patients to definitely cure their blood disorder. In the case of \u03b2 thalassemia this is done by turning off the defective adult hemoglobin (HbA) production and instead turning the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production back on. After eradicating the bone marrow cells with the defective genes, the (externally CRISPR-Cas9 modified) stem cells are reintroduced as with a bone marrow transplant. Since this involves the patients own cells, no immune-system suppressing medication is necessary, and eventually the new cells should produce enough HbF to allow the patient to be considered cured.\nSo far in international trials over 90% of those treated in this manner were still symptom-free, raising the hope that this \u03b2 thalassemia treatment is indeed a life-long cure.\nTop image: A giemsa stained blood smear from a person with beta thalassemia.

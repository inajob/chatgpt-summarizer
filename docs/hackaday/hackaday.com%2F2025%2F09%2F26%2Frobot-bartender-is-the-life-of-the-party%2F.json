[benkokes] found himself in this familiar predicament and did what any of us would do, but his process wasnt without a few party fouls as well as a few head-scratchers.\nOne of the common problems that people who suddenly find themselves with an old industrial robot have is that theres usually no documentation or instructions. This was true here with the added hiccup of the robots UI being set to Chinese. Luckily no one had changed the root password, and eventually he was able to get the robot up and working.\nGetting it to make drinks was a different matter altogether. [benkokes] needed a custom tool to hold the cup as well as shake it, and 3D printed a claw-style end effector with a lid. Out of his multi-colored pack of party cups, however, the orange cups were different enough in dimension to cause problems for the shaking lid which was discovered when the robot spilled a drink all over the table.\nEventually, though, the robot was successfully serving drinks at a party. One of [benkokes]s friends happened to be a puppet maker and was able to outfit it with a tailored tuxedo for the party as well, and he also programmed it to dance in between serving drinks, completing the AI revolution we have all been hoping for. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is a common project for people who suddenly come to posses a large general-purpose industrial robot, while others build robots specifically for this task alone.\n\n"}

For as harmless as a fine cloud of flour, sawdust or even coffee creamer may appear, each of these have the potential for a massive conflagration and even an earth-shattering detonation.\nAs for the why, the answer can be found in for example the working principle behind an internal combustion engine. While a puddle of gasoline is definitely flammable, the only thing that actually burns is the evaporated gaseous form above the liquid, ergo its a relatively slow process; in order to make petrol combust, it needs to be mixed in the right air-fuel ratio. If this mixture is then exposed to a spark, the fuel will nearly instantly burn, causing a detonation due to the sudden release of energy.\nSimilarly, flour, sawdust, and many other substances in powder form will burn gradually if a certain transition interface is maintained. A bucket of sawdust burns slowly, but if you create a sawdust cloud, it might just blow up the room.\nThis raises the questions of how to recognize this danger and what to do about it.\n\nWelcome To The Chemical Safety Board\nIn an industrial setting, people will generally acknowledge that oil refineries and chemical plants are dangerous and can occasionally go boom in rather violent ways. More surprising is that something as seemingly innocuous as a sugar refinery and packing plant can go from a light sprinkling of sugar dust to a violent and lethal explosion within a second. This is however what happened in 2008 at the Georgia Imperial Sugar refinery, which killed fourteen and injured thirty-six. During this disaster, a primary and multiple secondary explosions ripped through the building, completely destroying it.\nGeorgia Imperial Sugar Refinery aftermath in 2008. (Credit: USCSB)\nAs described in the US Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) report with accompanying summary video (embedded below), the biggest cause was a lack of ventilation and cleaning that allowed for a build-up of sugar dust, with an ignition source, likely an overheated bearing, setting off the primary explosion. This explosion then found subsequent fuel to ignite elsewhere in the building, setting off a chain reaction.\n\nWhat is striking is just how simple and straightforward both the build-up towards the disaster and the means to prevent it were. Even without knowing the exact air-fuel ratio for the fuel in question, there are only two points on the scale where you have a mixture that will not violently explode in the presence of an ignition source.\nThese are either a heavily saturated solution  too much fuel, not enough air  or the inverse. Essentially, if the dust-collection systems at the Imperial Sugar plant had been up to the task, and expanded to all relevant areas, the possibility of an ignition event would have likely been reduced to zero.\nThings Like To Burn\nIn the context of dust explosions, its somewhat discomforting to realize just how many things around us are rather excellent sources of fuel. The aforementioned sugar, for example, is a carbohydrate (Cm(H2O)n). This chemical group also includes cellulose, which is a major part of wood dust, explaining why reducing dust levels in a woodworking shop is about much more than just keeping ones lungs happy. Nobody wants their backyard woodworking shop to turn into a mini-Imperial Sugar ground zero, after all.\nCarbohydrates arent far off from hydrocarbons, which includes our old friend petrol, as well as methane (CH4), butane (C4H10), etc., which are all delightfully combustible. All that the carbohydrates have in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms are a lot of oxygen atoms, which is an interesting addition in the context of them being potential fuel sources. It incidentally also illustrates how important carbon is for life on this planet since its forms the literal backbone of its molecules.\nAlthough one might conclude from this that only something which is a carbohydrate or hydrocarbon is highly flammable, theres a whole other world out there of things that can burn. Case in point: metals.\nLit Metals\nOn December 9, 2010, workers were busy at the New Cumberland AL Solutions titanium plant in West Virginia, processing titanium powder. At this facility, scrap titanium and zirconium were milled and blended into a powder that got pressed into discs. Per the report, a malfunction inside one blender created a heat source that ignited the metal powder, killing three employees and injuring one contractor. As it turns out, no dust control methods were installed at the plant, allowing for uncontrolled dust build-up.\n\nAs pointed out in the USCSB report, both titanium and zirconium will readily ignite in particulate form, with zirconium capable of auto-igniting in air at room temperature. This is why the milling step at AL Solutions took place submerged in water. After ignition, titanium and zirconium require a Class D fire extinguisher, but its generally recommended to let large metal fires burn out by themselves. Using water on larger titanium fires can produce hydrogen, leading conceivably to even worse explosions.\nThe phenomenon of metal fires is probably best known from thermite. This is a mixture of a metal powder and a metal oxide. After ignited by an initial source of heat, the redox process becomes self-sustaining, providing the fuel, oxygen, and heat. While generally iron(III) oxide and aluminium are used, many more metals and metal oxides can be combined, including a copper oxide for a very rapid burn.\nWhile thermite is intentionally kept as a powder, and often in some kind of container to create a molten phase that sustains itself, it shouldnt be hard to imagine what happens if the metal is ground into a fine powder, distributed as a fine dust cloud in a confined room and exposed to an ignition source. At that point the differences between carbohydrates, hydrocarbons and metals become mostly academic to any survivors of the resulting inferno.\nPreventing Dust Explosions\nAs should be quite obvious at this point, theres no real way to fight a dust explosion, only to prevent it. Proper ventilation, preventing dust from building up and having active dust extraction in place where possible are about the most minimal precautions one should take. Complacency as happened at the Imperial Sugar plant merely invites disaster: if you can see the dust build-up on surfaces  dust in the air, youre already at least at DEFCON 2.\nA demonstration of how easy it is to create a solid dust explosion came from the Mythbusters back in 2008 when they tested the sawdust cannon myth. This involved blowing sawdust into a cloud and igniting it with a flare, creating a massive fireball. After nearly getting their facial hair singed off with this roaring success, they then tried the same with non-dairy coffee creamer, which created an even more massive fireball.\nFortunately the Mythbusters build team was supervised by adults on the bomb range for these experiments, as it shows just how incredibly dangerous dust explosions can be. Even out in the open on a secure bomb range, never mind in an enclosed space, as hundreds have found out over the decades in the US alone. One only has to look at the USCSBs dust explosions statistics to learn to respect the dangers a bit more."}

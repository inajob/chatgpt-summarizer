[Uri Tuchman] had a different idea. He wanted to make a clock out of the gears used in the lathe. Can he do it? Of course, as you can see in the video below.\nAlong the way, he used several tools. A mill, a laser cutter, and a variety of hand tools all make appearances. Theres also plenty of CAD. Oh yeah, he uses a lathe, too.\n\nInitially, the clock ran a little fast. A longer pendulum was the answer, but that required the clock to sit on a table edge because the pendulum now extends below the bottom of the clock!\nWe have to admit there is a lot going into this, but it looks great by the time it is done. We are impressed with the range of different tools used and the clever design. Of course, he could have made the gears, too, but using the metal gears already available is a nice touch.\nYou can, of course, get by with less. Much less. Or, you might elect to try something even more elaborate.\n"}

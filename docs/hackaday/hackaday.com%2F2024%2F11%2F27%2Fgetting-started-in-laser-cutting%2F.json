A few years ago that would inevitably been one of the ubiquitous blue Chinese-made K40 machines, but here in 2024 its become common to see something far more sophisticated. For all that, many of us are still laser cutter noobs, and for us [Dominic Morrow] gave a talk at last summers EMF Camp in the UK entitled Getting Started In Laser Cutting. [Dominic] is a long-term laser cutting specialist who now works for Lightburn, so hes ideally placed to deliver this subject.\nIts fair to say that this is an overview in the time available for a hacker camp talk rather than an in-depth piece, so he takes the approach of addressing peoples misconceptions and concerns about cutters. Perhaps the most important one he addresses is the exhaust, something weve seen a few in our community neglect in favor of excessive attention to laser cooling or other factors. An interesting one for us though was his talking about the cheaper diode lasers, having some insight into this end of the market is valuable when you have no idea which way to go.\nWere sorry to have missed this one in the real world, perhaps because of the allure of junk.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5207\u65ad\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3088\u304f\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u3001\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14\u5185\u5bb9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5207\u65ad\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Dominic Morrow\u306b\u3088\u308b\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5207\u65ad\u5165\u9580", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5207\u65ad\u6a5f\u306e\u8aa4\u89e3\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6d88\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\u3068\u306f", "- EMF\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5207\u65ad\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58"]}

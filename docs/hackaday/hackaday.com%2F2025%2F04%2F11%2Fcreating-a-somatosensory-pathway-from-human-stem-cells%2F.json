One of these being human neurology, with aspects like the human brain and the somatosensory pathways (i.e. touch etc.) being not only hard to study in non-human animal analogs, but also (genetically) different enough that a human test subject is required. Over the past years the use of human organoids have come into use, which are (parts of) organs grown from human pluripotent stem cells and thus allow for ethical human experimentation.\nFor studying aspects like the somatosensory pathways, multiple of such organoids must be combined, with recently [Ji-il Kim] et al. as published in Nature demonstrating the creation of a so-called assembloid. This four-part assembloid contains somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids, covering the entirety of such a pathway from e.g. ones skin to the brains cortex where the sensory information is received.\nSuch assembloids are  much like organoids  extremely useful for not only studying biological and biochemical processes, but also to research diseases and disorders, including tactile deficits as previously studied in mouse models by e.g. [Lauren L. Orefice] et al. caused by certain genetic mutations in Mecp2 and other genes, as well as genes like SCN9A that can cause clinical absence of pain perception.\nUsing these assembloids the development of these pathways can be studied in great detail and therapies developed and tested.", "title": "- \u30d2\u30c8\u795e\u7d4c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\uff1a\u30a2\u30c3\u30bb\u30e0\u30dc\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u795e\u7d4c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3092\u7814\u7a76\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u30d2\u30c8\u7531\u6765\u306e\u30aa\u30eb\u30ac\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u9032\u5c55\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d2\u30c8\u795e\u7d4c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\uff1a\u30a2\u30c3\u30bb\u30e0\u30dc\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u7d44\u7e54\u5de5\u5b66\u306b\u3088\u308b\u502b\u7406\u7684\u306a\u4eba\u9593\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30d2\u30c8\u30aa\u30eb\u30ac\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u89e6\u899a\u7d4c\u8def\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "- \u795e\u7d4c\u969c\u5bb3\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a2\u30c3\u30bb\u30e0\u30dc\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u611f\u899a\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u5168\u4f53\u50cf\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853"]}

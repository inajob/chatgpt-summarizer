That can be an iffy thing to get right for someone who lacks familiarity with CNC platforms. Prusa Research aims to make it a bit easier with a web app that can measure tension via your mobile phones microphone and diagnose belt tightness, at least for their MK4 and XL printers.\nUsing different tools to analyze belt tightness (including belt acoustics) have been tried in the past with mixed results, but this is a pretty focused approach that aims to give exact guidance for specific printer models. Its pretty useful to provide someone with a reliable go/no-go number, after all.\nWhat happens to a printer if a belts tension is not right? Well, theres actually a pretty forgiving range within which the printer will mostly work fine, but not as well as it could be. Loose belts can have novices chasing other problems, and overly-tightened belts definitely put extra strain on parts. Its one of those things thats worth a little extra work to get right.\n3D printable tension meter is a different option for Prusa MK3 and Mini printers, if one has some Prusament PETG to print it in.\nEverything about belt tension for Prusa printers is covered in their documentation, but did you know theres also neat 3D printable tension meter for Prusa MK3 and Mini printers? Its meant to be printed in Prusament PETG (printing in other materials may have different results) but its a pretty neat idea for a tool.\nIf you have a Prusa MK4 or XL and want to try their new method, go here and allow access to your devices microphone. Then select a printer model and an axis to test. Gently strum the upper part of the belt (avoid touching the bottom belt in the process) and watch live results telling you whether the belt is too tight, too loose, or just right. Prusa have a video demonstrating the process, also embedded below.\n\n"}

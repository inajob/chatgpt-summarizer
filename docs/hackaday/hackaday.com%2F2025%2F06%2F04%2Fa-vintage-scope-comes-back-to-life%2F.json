Its definitely seen better days, and is a single-trace 10 MHz unit of the type you might have seen in a typical general purpose electronics lab back in the day.\nPulling the cover off, and as expected theres a row of tubes each side of the centrally mounted CRT. No printed circuits in sight, and no transistors either, though the rectifiers are selenium parts. After a clean-up its time to look at the tubes, and they show the metallic deposits characteristic of long operation. Were more used to that from older televisions than test equipment,\nGently bringing the power up it looks promising, but theres a purple glow from one of the PCL82 triode-pentodes. Replacing that and a double-triode results in a scope that surprisingly, is working. It was evidently a high quality device in the first place, with components capable of lasting for over six decades.\nWeve seen more from his bench involving tubes, including this device using a magic-eye tube as the heavy lifter.\n\n"}

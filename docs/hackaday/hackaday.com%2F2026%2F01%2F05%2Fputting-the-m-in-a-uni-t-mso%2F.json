He shows you how it works in a recent video below.\nHes looked at the scopes analog capabilities before and was not unimpressed. The probes arent inexpensive, but they do unlock the mixed signal capabilities of the instrument.\n\nAlthough simple logic analyzers are very affordable today, having the capability integrated with your scope has several advantages, including integrated triggering and the simple convenience of being able to switch measurement modes with no problem.\nIn many cases, being able to do things like decode UART signals without dragging out a laptop and firing up software is a nice feature. If all youve used are the super-cheap USB logic analyzers, you may find some of the features of a more serious instrument surprising.\nIs it worth the extra expense? That depends on you and what you are doing. But if you ever wondered if it was worth splurging on digital probes for a UNI-T scope, [Kerry] can help you decide.\nNot that simple logic analyzers arent useful, and they certainly cost less. Some of them will even work as a scope, too.\n"}

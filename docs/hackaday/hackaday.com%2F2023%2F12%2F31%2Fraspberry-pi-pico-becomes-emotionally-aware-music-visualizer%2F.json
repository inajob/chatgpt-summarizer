We all cultivated huge MP3 collections and spent hours staring at the best visualizers Winamp and Windows Media Player had to offer. [Rafael] and [Eric] decided to bring back those glory days with their music visualizer that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico.\nThe design is quite interesting, going beyond the usual simplistic display of waveforms and spectrograms. Instead, the Pi Pico uses a Fast Fourier Transform analysis to determine the frequencies of the music, ideally then to determine the key, and thus the mood, of the tune.\u00a0 Then, the visualizer uses different colors to represent those moods, such as green for happy music in a major key, or deeper blues for a sad piece in a minor key. The output of the visualizer is via Bruce Lands 8-bit color VGA library, which allows the Pi Pico to drive a monitor directly.\nWhether the visualizer really\u00a0gets the music is up for debate.\u00a0 The visuals simply dont look sad and depressing enough when listening to Hallelujah, but maybe thats just the lack of Jeff Buckleys vocals in the instrumental. Furthermore, getting an FFT analysis to pull out reliable musical information from an audio recording is finicky to say the least. In any case, the blocky and colorful animations are nice to watch nonetheless. Theyd make an excellent basis for visuals at your next underground chiptune show, that much is for certain. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

If you are working with modern tech its easy, there are plenty of vendors who can sell you keycaps for any purpose. With retro tech its never so simple, if a keycap hasnt been made for decades youre out of luck. This doesnt faze [Drygol] though, who has solved the coloured retro keycap in a unique and non-destructive way. Wrap them in vinyl film using a vacuum former.\nVacuum formers are an often-underrated tool in the hardware arsenal, but as this project shows, they can produce startlingly good results. Original keycaps are placed on a 3D-printed scaffold before the vinyl is formed over them, then they are carefully cut out and a triangular edge on both sides is folded underneath, The result is an Amiga with a striking orange keyboard, and for us the best bit is that the original key is safely preserved under the vinyl.\n[Drygol]s exceptional work in the retrocomputing sphere has delighted us many times on these pages. There are too many examples to link here, but one we particularly liked was this nearly-all-new Amiga 2000.", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "body": "\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u5165\u529b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u7279\u5225\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3067\u3059\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306a\u3089\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u3001\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u76ee\u7684\u306b\u5408\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001[Drygol]\u306f\u30f4\u30a3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "\u30d0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aDIY", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306b", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9bae\u3084\u304b\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210"]}

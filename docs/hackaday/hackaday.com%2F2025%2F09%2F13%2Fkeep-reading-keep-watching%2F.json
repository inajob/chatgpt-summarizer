Last weekend, I was working on some wiring that had gotten caught and ripped a pad off of the controller PCB. It wasn\u2019t so bad, because there was a large SMT capacitor nearby, and I could just piggyback on that, but the problem was how to re-route the wires to avoid this happening again.\nBy luck, I had just watched a video where someone else was building up a new quad, and had elegantly solved the exact same routing problem. I was just watching the video because I was curious about the frame in question, and I had absolutely no idea that it would contain the solution to a problem that I was just about to encounter, but because I was paying attention, it make it all a walk in the park.\nI can\u2019t count the number of times that I\u2019ve had this experience: the blind luck of having just read or seen something that solves a problem I\u2019m about to encounter. It\u2019s a great feeling, and it\u2019s one of the reasons that I\u2019ve always read Hackaday \u2013 you never know when one hacker\u2019s neat trick is going to be just the one you need next week. Indeed, that\u2019s one of the reasons that we try to feature not just the gonzo hacks that drill down deep on a particular feat, but also the little ones too, that solve something in particular in a neat way. Because reading up on the hacks is free, and particularly cheap insurance against tomorrow\u2019s unexpected dilemmas.\nRead more Hackaday!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

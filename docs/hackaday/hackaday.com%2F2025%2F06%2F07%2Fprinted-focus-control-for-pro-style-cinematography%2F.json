Instead, they will have been planned and programmed in advance and executed by a motor. If you take a close look at many lenses youll see a ring thats more than just extra knurling, its a gear wheel for this purpose. Want to experiment with this technique without buying professional grade accessories? [l0u0k0e] has you covered with a 3D printable focus zoom motor accessory.\n\nThe motor behind it all is a geared stepper motor, and there are a set of printed parts to complete the model. Its recommended to use PETG, and nylon for the gears, but it would work in PLA with a shorter life. Its designed to work with the standard 15 mm tube youll find on many camera rigs, and while you can write your own Arduino sketches to control it if you wish, were given instructions for hooking it up to existing focus drivers. The model is on Printables, should you wish to try.\nThis is by no means the first focus puller weve seen, in fact you can even use LEGO."}

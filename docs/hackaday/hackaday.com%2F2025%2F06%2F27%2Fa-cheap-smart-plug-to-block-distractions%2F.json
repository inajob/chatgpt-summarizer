You check social media, or maybe the news, and before you know it a while has been wasted. [Neil Chen] came up with a solution, to configure a cheap smart plug with a script to block his diversions of choice.\nThe idea is simple enough, the plug is in an outlet that requires getting up and walking a distance to access, so to flip that switch youve really got to want to do it. Behind it lives a Python script that can be found in a Git Hub repository, and thats it! We like it for its simplicity and ingenuity, though wed implore any of you to avoid using it to block Hackaday. Some sites are simply too important to avoid!\nOf course, if distraction at work is your problem, perhaps you should simply run something without it."}

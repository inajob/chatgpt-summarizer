But if you dont have one, no worries. You can still do a lot with common tools like a vise and torches. [Bwrussell] shows you how. He welds together a die to use as a bending jig and makes a set of table legs.\nYou might think that putting metal in a vise and bending it isnt exactly brain surgery. It isnt, but there is more to it than that. Starting with a bending plan and the creation of the jigs, clamping and bending is only part of it. You can see a little bit of the action in the video below.\nSpeaking of planning, the design was in Fusion 360s sheet metal workflow. To facilitate the bends, the build uses two torches. A MAPP torch gets very hot, and a propane torch makes sure that a larger area stays hot. There are quite a few tips you can pick up in this post, even if you arent making table legs.\nFusion 360 does a lot of the design work, but if you want a quick lesson on what happens when you bend metal, we can help. Want to make your own metal brake?\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306fFusion 360\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u66f2\u3052\u306b\u306f2\u3064\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3092\u3054\u89a7\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u66f2\u3052\u30b8\u30b0\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u811a\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cFusion 360\u3068\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "\u300c\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u30c8\u30fc\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u66f2\u3052\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u3067\u904a\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u300d"]}

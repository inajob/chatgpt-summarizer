But theres another Commodore computing story, that of the machines we never received, many of which came close enough to production\u00a0 that they might have made it.\n[Old VCR] has the story of one of these, and its a portable. Its not a C64 like the luggable which did emerge, neither is it the legendary LCD portable prototype in the possession of our Hackaday colleague [Bil Herd]. Instead its a palmtop branded under licence from Toshiba, and since its a rare device even its home country of Japan the article gives us perhaps the only one well ever see with either badge.\nThe Commodore HHC-4 was announced at Winter CES 1983, and since it was never seen again its aroused some curiosity among enthusiasts. The article goes to some lengths to cross-reference the visible features and deduce that its in fact a Toshiba Pasopia Mini, a typical palmtop computer of the era with not much in the way of processing power, a small alphanumeric display, and a calculator-style QWERTY keyboard. Were treated to a teardown of a Toshiba unit and its dock, revealing some uncertainty about which processor architecture lurks in those Toshiba custom chips.\nLooking at the magazine reviews and adverts it seems as though Commodore may have had some machines with their branding on even if they never sold them, so there exists the tantalizing possibility of one still lurking forgotten in the possession of a former staffer. We can hope.\nIf Commodore history interests you, you really should read [Bil]s autobiographical account of the company in the 1980s."}

This project was created by [Andrew Shim], [Tyler Wisniewski] and another group member for Cornells ECE 4760 class on embedded design (which should silence naysayers who think the Pi Pico cant be a serious microcontroller), and simulates the infamous soviet RMBK reactor of Chernobyl fame.\u00a0\nThe simulation uses a 4-bit color VGA model. The fission model includes uranium fuel, water, graphite moderator, control rods and neutrons. To simplify the math, all decayed materials are treated identically as non-fissile, so no xenon poisoning is going to show up, for example. You can, however, take manual control to both scram the reactor and set it up to melt down with the hardware controller.\nThe RP2040s dual-core nature comes in handy here: one core runs the main simulation loop, and the main graphic on the top of the VGA output; the other core generates the plots on the bottom half of the screen, and the Geiger-counter sound effect, and polls the buttons and encoders for user input. This is an interesting spread compared to the more usual GPU/CPU split we see on projects that use the RP2040 with VGA output.\nAn interesting wrinkle that has been declared a feature, not a bug, by the students behind this project, is that the framebuffer cannot keep up with all the neutrons in a meltdown simulation. Apparently the flickering and stuttering of frame-rate issues is befitting of the meltdown scenario. The idea that ones microcontroller melts down along with the simulated reactor is rather fitting, we agree. Check it out in a full walkthrough in the video below, or enjoy the students full writeup at the link above.\nThis project comes to us via Cornell Universitys ECE 4760 course, which weve mentioned before. Thanks to [Hunter Adams] for the tipoff. You may see more student projects in the coming weeks.\n\n"}

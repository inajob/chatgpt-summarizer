[Simon the Magpie] has been working on something thats just a little innovative, and built what he refers to as an Incredible Horror Instrument. Its all about feedback.\nThe build started with the Suzuki Andes 25F, a so-called keyboard recorder. It has the appearance of a melodion but produces flute-like sounds. [Simon]s idea was to combine the breath-powered instrument with a talk box. If youre unfamiliar, a talk box is designed for playing amplified guitar sounds through a tube that is placed in a players mouth so they can shape the guitar sound with their mouth.\nIn this role, though, the talk boxs input is hooked up to a microphone which captures the output of the Andes 25F. It then plays this back through a tube connected to the breath input of the Andes 25F. [Simon] thus created a feedback look that can effectively be played via the keyboard on the Andes 25F.\nThe audible results are eerie and haunting, and seem more than fitting for even a well-budgeted horror film. [Simon] also demonstrates some neat possibilities when combining the setup with a further feedback loop that feeds in other tones.\nWeve covered [Simons] work before; its often noisy and always entertaining. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

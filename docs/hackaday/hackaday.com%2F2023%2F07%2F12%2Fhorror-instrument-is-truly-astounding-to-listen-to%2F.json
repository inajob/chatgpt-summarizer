[Simon the Magpie] has been working on something thats just a little innovative, and built what he refers to as an Incredible Horror Instrument. Its all about feedback.\nThe build started with the Suzuki Andes 25F, a so-called keyboard recorder. It has the appearance of a melodion but produces flute-like sounds. [Simon]s idea was to combine the breath-powered instrument with a talk box. If youre unfamiliar, a talk box is designed for playing amplified guitar sounds through a tube that is placed in a players mouth so they can shape the guitar sound with their mouth.\nIn this role, though, the talk boxs input is hooked up to a microphone which captures the output of the Andes 25F. It then plays this back through a tube connected to the breath input of the Andes 25F. [Simon] thus created a feedback look that can effectively be played via the keyboard on the Andes 25F.\nThe audible results are eerie and haunting, and seem more than fitting for even a well-budgeted horror film. [Simon] also demonstrates some neat possibilities when combining the setup with a further feedback loop that feeds in other tones.\nWeve covered [Simons] work before; its often noisy and always entertaining. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u4fe1\u3058\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u307b\u3069\u306e\u6050\u6016\u306e\u697d\u5668\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f", "body": "\u300c\u4fe1\u3058\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u307b\u3069\u306e\u6050\u308d\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5438\u6c17\u5668\u3068\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u51fa\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u97f3\u8272\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u4fe1\u3058\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u307b\u3069\u306e\u6050\u6016\u306e\u697d\u5668\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u697d\u5668\u3068\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u878d\u5408", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668\u306e\u958b\u767a\uff1a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30b925F\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u697d\u5668\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u660e"]}

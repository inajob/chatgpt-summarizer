Theyre fun, but serve mostly as a way to relive old toys.\nAs microcontrollers become faster though its inevitable that the machines they can emulate become more powerful too, so were moving into the realm of emulating productivity machines from years past. An example is [Ilya Maslennikov]s pico-286, which as its name suggests, is a 286 PC emulator for the Raspberry Pi Pico.\nIt has an impressive set of sound and video card emulations, can drive either a VGA or an HDMI monitor, and uses a PS/2 keyboard and mouse. If DOS games are your thing it should provide what you want, but its caught our eye because there was a time when a 286 DOS PC was a productivity machine. Theres a huge library of still-useful software for DOS, and thus the prospect of a handheld DOS PC still has some appeal. Wed love to see someone put this in a badge.\nMS-DOS may no longer be for sale, but there are several ways to land an open-source DOS in 2025. FreeDOS is something of a powerhouse.", "title": "\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b286PC\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067286PC\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u7121\u6599\u306eDOS\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b286PC\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "\u300c\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eDOSPC\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u9ad8\u901f\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u751f\u7523\u6027\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d", "\u300cVGA\u304a\u3088\u3073HDMI\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064286\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "\u300cFreeDOS\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9DOSPC\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d"]}

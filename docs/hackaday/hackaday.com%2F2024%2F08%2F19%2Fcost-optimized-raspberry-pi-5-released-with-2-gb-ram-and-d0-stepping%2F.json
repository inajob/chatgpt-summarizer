Now Raspberry Pi has announced the launch of a third Raspberry Pi 5 variant: a 2 GB version which also features a new stepping of the BCM2712 SoC. This would sell for about $50 USD and feature the D0 stepping that purportedly strips out a lot of the dark silicon that is not used on the SBC.\nThese unused die features are likely due to the Broadcom SoCs used on Raspberry Pi SBCs being effectively recycled set-top box SoCs and similar. This means that some features that make sense in a set-top box or such do not make sense for a general-purpose SBC, but still take up die space and increase the manufacturing defect rate. The D0 stepping thus would seem to be based around an optimized die, with as only possible negative being a higher power density due to a (probably) smaller die, making active cooling even more important.\nAs for whether 2 GB is enough for your purposes depends on your use case, but knocking $10 off the price of an RPi 5 could be worth it for some. Perhaps more interesting is that this same D0 stepping of the SoC is likely to make it to the other RAM variants as well. Were awaiting benchmarks to see what the practical difference is between the current C1 and new D0 steppings.\nThanks to [Mark Stevens] for the tip.", "title": "Raspberry Pi 5 SBC\u306e\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\uff1a2 GB\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u767a\u58f2", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306b2 GB RAM\u30d0\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u3001\u3088\u308a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306aBCM2712 SoC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u6700\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u306a\u3044\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u9664\u3044\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3002\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u306f\u7d04$50\u3067\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u9055\u3044\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u5f85\u3061\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi 5 SBC\u306e\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\uff1a2 GB\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u767a\u58f2", "Raspberry Pi 5 SBC\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044BCM2712 SoC\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f3\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u30d0\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9", "Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\uff1a2 GB\u7248\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u4fa1\u683c", "Raspberry Pi 5 SBC\u306e\u65b0\u7248\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305fD0 stepping\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "Raspberry Pi 5 SBC\u306e\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u671f\u5f85"]}

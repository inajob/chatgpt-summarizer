Weve seen it done with the Raspberry Pi, and the concept is the same.\nUbuntu users should check out systemd-zram-generator instead, and be aware that zram might already be installed and configured by default on your Ubuntu Desktop system.\nIf youre interested in the history of in-kernel memory compression LWN.net has an old article covering the technology as it was gestating back in 2013: In-kernel Memory Compression. For those trying to get\u00a0a grip on what has happened with RAM prices in recent history, a good place to track memory prices is memory.net and if you swing by you can see that a lot of RAM has gone up as much as four times in the last three or four months.\nIf you have any tips or hacks for memory compression on other platforms we would love to hear from you in the comments section!", "title": "- \u9ad8\u9a30\u3059\u308bRAM\u4fa1\u683c\u306b\u5bfe\u51e6\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "AI\u9700\u8981\u5897\u52a0\u306b\u4f34\u3044\u3001RAM\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u9ad8\u9a30\u3002ZRam\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u65e2\u5b58RAM\u306e\u5727\u7e2e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u5229\u7528\u3092\u63a8\u5968\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9ad8\u9a30\u3059\u308bRAM\u4fa1\u683c\u306b\u5bfe\u51e6\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Debian\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u306eZRam\u5c0e\u5165\u3068\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- Ubuntu\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff01systemd-zram-generator\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u306eRAM\u5727\u7e2e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u5909\u52d5\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

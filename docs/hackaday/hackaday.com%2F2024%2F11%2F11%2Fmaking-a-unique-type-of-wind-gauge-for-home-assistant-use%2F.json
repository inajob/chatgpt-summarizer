Knowing the direction of the wind can be a plus, too. To that end, [Sebastian Soko\u0142owski] built himself an unusual anemometer\u2014a wind gauge\u2014to feed into his smart home system.\n[Sebastians] build is able to tell both wind speed\u00a0and direction\u2014and with no moving parts! Sort of, anyway. That makes the design altogether different from the usual cup type anemometers with wind vanes that you might be used to seeing on home weather stations. [Sebastian] wanted to go a different route\u2014he wanted a sensor that wouldnt be so subject to physical wear over time.\nThe build relies on strain gauges. Basically, [Sebastian] 3D printed a sail-like structure that will flex under the influence of the wind. With multiple strain gauges mounted on the structure, its possible to determine the strength of the wind making it flex and in what direction. [Sebastian] explains how this is achieved, particularly involving the way the device compensates for typical expansion and contraction due to temperature changes.\nIts a really unique way to measure wind speed and direction; wed love to learn more about how it performs in terms of precision, accuracy, and longevity\u2014particularly with regards to regular mechanical and ultrasonic designs. Well be keeping a close eye on [Sebastians] work going forward. Video after the break.\n\n"}

As an exemplar of naval architecture, though  well, lets just say that if it werent for the trapped air in the infilled areas, most Benchy prints wouldnt float at all. About the only way to make Benchy less seaworthy would be to make it out of cast iron. Challenge accepted.\nWeve grown accustomed to seeing [Denny] over at Shake the Future on YouTube using his microwave-powered kilns to cast all sorts of metal, but this time he puts his skill and experience to melting iron. For those not in the know, he uses standard consumer-grade microwave ovens to heat kilns made from ceramic fiber and lots of Kapton tape, which hold silicon carbide crucibles that get really, really hot under the RF onslaught. It works surprisingly well, especially considering he does it all on an apartment balcony.\nFor this casting job, he printed a Benchy model from PLA and made a casting mold from finely ground silicon carbide blasting medium mixed with a little sodium silicate, or water glass. His raw material was a busted-up barbell weight, which melted remarkably well in the kiln. The first pour appeared to go well, but the metal didnt quite make it all the way to the tip of Benchys funnel. Round two was a little more exciting, with a cracked crucible and spilled molten metal. The third time was a charm, though, with a nice pour and complete mold filling thanks to the vibrations of a reciprocating saw.\nAfter a little fettling and a saltwater bath to achieve the appropriate patina, [Denny] built a neat little Benchy tableau using microwave-melted blue glass as a stand-in for water. It highlights the versatility of his method, which really seems like a game-changer for anyone who wants to get into home forging without the overhead of a proper propane or oil-fired furnace.\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3067\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u3092\u6eb6\u304b\u3057\u3066\u9020\u5f62\uff1a3DBenchy\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "3DBenchy\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001[Denny]\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3092\u9244\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3092\u884c\u3044\u6210\u529f\u3002\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u88fd\u9244\u6cd5\u3067\u8239\u8236\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u751f\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u92f3\u578b\u4f5c\u6210\u3001\u92f3\u9020\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u793a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3067\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u3092\u6eb6\u304b\u3057\u3066\u9020\u5f62\uff1a3DBenchy\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\uff1a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6eb6\u9271\u7089", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u92f3\u9020\u307e\u3067", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306aDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3067\u98fe\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u8239", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u92f3\u9020\u6280\u8853\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30af"]}

This episode starts off with a discussion of the Vintage Computer Festival East and Philadelphia Maker Faire  two incredible events that just so happened to be scheduled for the same weekend. From there the discussion moves on to the latest developments in DIY soft robotics, the challenge of running Linux on 8-pin ICs, hardware mods to improve WiFi reception on cheap ESP32 development boards, and whats keeping old smartphones from being reused as general purpose computers.\nYoull also hear about Command and Conquer: Red Alert running on the Pi Pico 2, highly suspect USB-C splitters, and producing professional looking PCBs at home with a fiber laser. Stick around to the end to hear about the current state of non-Google web browsers, and a unique new machine that can engrave circuit boards with remarkable accuracy.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nAs always, the Hackaday Podcast is available as a DRM-free MP3 download.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 316 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nCelebrating 30 Years Of Windows 95 At VCF\nIn 2025, The Philly Maker Faire Finds Its Groove\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [laserkiwi] for winning a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nSalamander Robot Is Squishy\n\nThe Future of Robots is Soft (and Squishy!)

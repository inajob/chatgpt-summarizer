For maximum nostalgia, it was modeled after the brown breadbox C64 case which so characterized the model. However, [10p6] wanted to build a tiny C64C instead, so set about making a conversion happen.\nThe build is primarily about the case design. [10p6] created a nice 50% scale duplicate of the C64C, with an eye to making it work with the internals of the popular C64 Mini. The case was paired with a custom PETSCII keyboard PCB and keycaps designed by [Bleugh]. This was a key element, since it wouldnt really feel like a functional C64C without a functional keyboard. The build also scored a bonus USB hub for more flexibility. For the best possible finish, the case, power button, and keycaps were all printed using a resin printer, which provides a more production-like result than FDM printers are capable of.\nIts funny how retro computers remain popular to this day, particularly amongst the hacker set. In contrast, we dont see a whole lot of people trying to replicate Pentium II machines from the mid-1990s. If you do happen to have a crack at it, though, the tipsline is always open.

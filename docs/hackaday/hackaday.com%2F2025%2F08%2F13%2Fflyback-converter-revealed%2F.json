Thats because there are smarter ways to get the same effect, which is to convert between two voltages. If you work on old gear, youll see plenty of these, and going through the analysis is educational, even if youll never actually work with the circuit. Thats what the video below shows: [Sams] analysis of why this circuit works.\nThe circuit in question uses a bridge rectifier to get a high-voltage DC voltage directly from the wall. Of course,\u00a0 you could just use a transformer to convert the AC to a lower AC voltage first, but then you probably need a regulator afterwards to get a stable voltage.\n\nThe converter operates as an oscillator. The duty cycle of the oscillator varies depending on the difference between the output voltage and a zener diode reference. These circuits are often difficult to model in a simulator, but [Ben] shows an LTSpice simulation that did take a few tweaks.\nAs he mentions, today youd get a switching regulator on a chip and be done with it. But it is still interesting to understand how the design works. Another common flyback circuit used an oscillator driving a CRT for the primary, more or less. If you want to learn more, we can help with that, too.\n"}

Now, [Jaron McDaniel] has built a tool to integrate many such devices into the world of Home Assistant.\nIts called RTL-HAOS, and its intended to act as a bridge. Whatever you can pick up using the RTL_433 tool, you can set up with Home Assistant using RTL-HAOS. If youre unfamiliar with RTL_433, its a multitalented data receiver for picking up all sorts of stuff on a range of bands using RTL-SDR receivers, as well as a range of other hardware. While its most closely associated with products that communicate in the 433 MHz band, it can also work with products that talk in 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz, assuming your hardware supports it. Out of the box, its capable of working with everything from keyless entry systems to thermostats, weather stations, and energy monitors. You can even use it to listen to the tire pressure monitors in your Fiat Abarth 124 Spider, if youre so inclined.\n[Jarons] tool integrates these devices nicely into Home Assistant, where theyll appear automatically thanks to MQTT discovery. It also offers nice signal metrics like RSSI and SNR, so you can determine whether a given link is stable. You can even use multiple RTL-SDR dongles if youre so inclined. If youre eager to pull some existing environmental sensors into your smart home, this may prove a very easy way to do it.\nThe cool thing about Home Assistant is that hackers are always working to integrate more gear into the ecosystem. Oftentimes, theyre far faster and more efficient at doing this than big-name corporations. Meanwhile, if youre working on your own hacks for this popular smart home platform, wed probably like to know about it.

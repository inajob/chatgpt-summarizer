They were heavy and unwieldy, but the computing compromises of using one at the time were less than with what served for more portable machinery. Its a form factor which understandably has long ago disappeared, but that hasnt stopped [Sdomi] from reviving it with a machine that packs plenty of modern computing power.\nIts a project that started with a monitor, a diminutive green-screen model which had previously adorned a CNC machine. Its a composite model, so its driven from a VGA-to-composite converter. The computing power comes from a thin-client board that packs an up-to-date AMD Ryzen processor and 32 GB of memory, and the case is manufactured from oriented strand chipboard.\nThe result is a chunky but definitely practical and usable take on a portable cyberdeck, with the caveat that a composite monitor will not deliver the resolution some of us might be used to. We have to admit rather liking it, theres nothing like the curved glass of a CRT.\nIts by no means the only up to date luggable weve seen, though more often now they feature an LCD."}

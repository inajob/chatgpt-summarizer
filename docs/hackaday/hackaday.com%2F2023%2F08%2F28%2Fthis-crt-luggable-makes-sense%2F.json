They were heavy and unwieldy, but the computing compromises of using one at the time were less than with what served for more portable machinery. Its a form factor which understandably has long ago disappeared, but that hasnt stopped [Sdomi] from reviving it with a machine that packs plenty of modern computing power.\nIts a project that started with a monitor, a diminutive green-screen model which had previously adorned a CNC machine. Its a composite model, so its driven from a VGA-to-composite converter. The computing power comes from a thin-client board that packs an up-to-date AMD Ryzen processor and 32 GB of memory, and the case is manufactured from oriented strand chipboard.\nThe result is a chunky but definitely practical and usable take on a portable cyberdeck, with the caveat that a composite monitor will not deliver the resolution some of us might be used to. We have to admit rather liking it, theres nothing like the curved glass of a CRT.\nIts by no means the only up to date luggable weve seen, though more often now they feature an LCD.", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "\u300c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300d- Sdomi\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u51e6\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u53e4\u3044\u5f62\u614b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "CRT\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u306a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u6700\u65b0\u306eAMD Ryzen\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u8584\u578b\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u6c4e\u7528\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "LCD\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb"]}

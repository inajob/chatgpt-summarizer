From there theyll look at the state-of-the-art in the sub-$100 3D printer category, Apples latest Right to Repair loophole, running UNIX on the NES (and how its different from Japans Famicom), and the latency of various wireless protocols.\nAfter singing the praises of the new Bus Pirate 5, discussion moves on to embedded Linux on spacecraft, artfully lifting IC pins, and the saga of the blue LED. Finally youll hear the how and why behind electrical steel, and marvel at a Mach 10 missile that (luckily) never needed to be used.\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 258 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nCanada Bans Flipper Zero Over What It Imagines It Does\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Bobby Tables] who won a Podcast T-shirt by identifying the worlds longest echo.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nEasyThreed K9: The Value In A \u20ac72 AliExpress FDM 3D Printer\nApple Pushes Back On Right To Repair Bill Due To Parts Pairing\nBenchmarking Latency Across Common Wireless Links For MCUs\nHow Different Are SpaceX Thermal Tiles From The Space Shuttle\u2019s?\nRunning UNIX On A Nintendo Entertainment System\nHands On: Bus Pirate 5\n\nHow-to: The Bus Pirate, Universal Serial Interface\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nSimple Magnetic Levitator\nThe Usage Of Embedded Linux In Spacecraft\nDroplet Watch Keeps Time Via Electrowetting\nTiny Flip Display\nLift Those Pins With Ease\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nMemory Box Shows Photos Based On Fingerprint\nAI-Powered Bumper Sticker Provides Context-Sensitive Urban Camouflage\nShuji Nakamura: The Man Who Gave Us The Blue LED Despite All Odds\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nElectrical Steel: The Material At Heart Of The Grid\nSprint: The Mach 10 Magic Missile That Wasn\u2019t Magic Enough\n"}

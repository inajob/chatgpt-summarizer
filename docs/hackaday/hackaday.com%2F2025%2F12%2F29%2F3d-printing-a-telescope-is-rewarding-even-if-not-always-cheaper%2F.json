[Molly Wakeling] shares her thoughts after doing exactly that. The performance was on par with any solid 8 telescope, but in the end it wasnt really any cheaper than purchasing a manufactured unit. Does that mean it wasnt worth it? Not at all!\n[Molly] makes the excellent observation that the process of printing and building ones own telescope is highly educational and rewarding. Also, the end result is modular, user-serviceable, and customizable in a way that many commercial offerings can only dream of. Its a great conversation starter with other enthusiasts, as well!\n[Molly] printed the 203 Leavitt design (3d models available on Printables) which is an 8 Newtonian telescope. This telescope design uses a concave parabolic mirror (a significant part of the expense) at the back of the tube to gather and focus light, and a small flat mirror near the front of the tube reflects this light to an eyepiece on the side. The wood stand makes things convenient, and we like the elastic tie-down used as a simple way to put tension on the mounts.\nDo you find yourself intrigued but would prefer to start a little smaller and cheaper? Good news, because the same designer of the 203 Leavitt has a very similar design we happen to have featured before: the 114 Hadley. It features easily obtainable, lower-cost optics which perform well and can be easily ordered online, making it a great DIY starter telescope.", "title": "8\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u306f\uff1f  ", "body": "8\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u5f0f\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u4f53\u9a13\u306f\u3001\u6709\u610f\u7fa9\u3067\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u9ad8\u304f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u6027\u3068\u4f1a\u8a71\u306e\u304d\u3063\u304b\u3051\u306b\u306a\u308b\u70b9\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["8\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u306f\uff1f  ", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u4fa1\u5024\u3068\u306f  ", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3055  ", "DIY\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01114 Hadley\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb  ", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f"]}

NASAs Artemis program is in full swing, and were hoping to get back to the surface of the Moon real soon. Astronauts havent walked on the beloved sky rock since 1972! A human landing was scheduled for 2025, which has now been pushed back to 2026, and were all getting a bit antsy about it. Last time we wanted to go, it only took 8 years!\nNow, somehow, its harder, but NASA also has its sights set higher. It no longer wants to just toddle about the Moon for a bit to wave at the TV cameras. This time, theres talk of establishing permanent bases on the Moon, and actually doing useful work, like mining. Its a tantalizing thought, but what does this mean for the sanctity of one of the last pieces of real estate yet to be spoilt by humans? Researchers are already arguing that we need to move to protect this precious, unique environment.\n\nTheres Moon Gold In Them Thar Moon Hills\nFeatures like Shackleton Crater may host water ice, which could be a vital resource for astronauts on the Moon. However, they may also hold secrets for researchers to uncover, with some suggesting they are perhaps best left undisturbed at this time.

With plans being worked up for a sustained base on the Moon, theres more interest in exploiting locally-available resources. This would help cut back on the amount of cargo required to be freighted in by rocket, which is incredibly expensive. Scientists have found frozen water on the Moon, lurking in craters that are shielded from the sun. They regularly remain at temperatures below -225 C, and could hold clues to how asteroids carried water to Earth. Or, they could be mined to sustain the needs of astronauts living on the Moon, either to provide water for drinking, or to split into oxygen for breathing and hydrogen for fuel.\nThere are also hopes that these ultra-cool craters could serve as a useful base for a Moon-based telescope. Much like space-based telescopes, a telescope on the Moon wouldnt have to contend with the distortions of Earths atmosphere, nor light pollution. By being so cold, it would be possible to build a highly-sensitive detector without a need for complicated refrigeration mechanisms as used on space telescopes like the JWST. A large telescope built in a Moon crater could potentially help us image the surfaces of distant planets similar to our own.\nAreas of surface ice identified by Indias Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.

Prime candidates are rare-earth elements and helium-3 deposits that could be useful for fusion power generation. The latter can be readily found on Earth, and the latter isnt particularly useful until we have viable commercial fusion reactors. However, scientists and engineers are always planning ahead, and there are researchers working on concepts for how these resources could be obtained on the Moon and brought back to Earth for gainful exploitation.\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been used to map the surface of the Moon. There are fears that increased numbers of satellites orbiting the Moon could frustrate radio astronomy efforts in future. Credit: NASA, public domain\nThe problem with mining is that it tends to disrupt the environment a bit. Or a lot, depending on how deep you go digging and how you go about it. On Earth, humanity has started to manage this problem. Many countries now require environmental assessments and strict approvals processes to be passed before new mining projects can begin. To some degree, this keeps mining activity in check, and helps preserve the environment. Sadly, plenty of environmental damage still occurs due to mining, but were at least aware of the problem and doing something to reign it in.\nOn the Moon, though, its an altogether different situation. The Moon isnt the property of any one nation, nor does it fall neatly within one countrys borders. The Artemis Accords were developed to solve this problem, being a set of Principles for Cooperation In The Civil Exploration And Use Of The Moon, Mars, Comets and Asteroids For Peaceful Purposes. Much like earlier space treaties, they enshrine cooperation and mutual respect as core tenets, and aim to avoid conflict or military uses of such areas or resources. They also commit nations to support each other through the use of interoperable standards wherever possible, and in rescue and provision of emergency assistance to each others astronauts.\nImages taken by Galileo using spectral filters were used to generate this false color image. It shows areas of different mineral composition on the Moons surface.

Concerns have been raised that mining operations could disrupt the natural environment, compromising efforts to study the Moon as it stands today. For example, water mining operations could destroy vital clues to the history of our solar system, buried deep in lunar ice. Increased activity in the Moons orbit could disrupt science efforts, too. With more satellites orbiting around the Moon in support of new operations, theres a risk that future radio astronomy efforts on the Moons far side could be disrupted by spurious emissions. The area has been set aside as a radio quiet zone since 1971 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), but the rules dont take into account the increased prevalence of new satellites.\nFor now, only a few sites are protected under the Artemis Accords. Historic artifacts left behind by the Apollo missions are the main example\u2014no surprise given the importance of the first Moon missions. However, the accords dont provide any real protection for areas of potential interest to scientists. Thus, its possible areas of great research value could be spoiled by the forward march of human mining operations.\nThere is a hope that this will change.\u00a0 The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is on the case. It hopes to clearly define which areas of the Moon should be preserved for further research. It also plans to improve upon the ITUs work in protecting the radio silence on the far side of the Moon, by creating clear rules for whats okay, and what isnt. A working group, led by astronomer Richard Green, held its first meeting on the matter last year.\nGiven we havent landed on the Moon yet, this might seem a bit like putting the cart before the horse. The problem is, once crucial sites on the Moon are mined or otherwise interfered with, crucial science could be lost forever. Thus, its important to have all this figured out before humans return to the Moon in any major way. Heres hoping scientists can protect whats important as humanity takes baby steps towards maybe, one day, spreading itself beyond this Earth."}

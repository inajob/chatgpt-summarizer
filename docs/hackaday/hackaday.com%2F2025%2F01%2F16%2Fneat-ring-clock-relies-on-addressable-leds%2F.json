They elected to go after a ring clock design, based around the ever-popular WS2812B addressable LEDs.\nThe core of the build is the HELTEC WiFi 32 development board. Its not one were intimately familiar with, but its based around the popular Expressif ESP32. Since its got WiFi, its able to simply dial up a network time server to always keep accurate time. It then drives a set of WS2812B LEDs set up in six rings. They display the current time with a layout akin to that of a typical analog clock.\nWhat makes this build just a little more fun is the inclusion of Disco Mode. At the press of a button, the full set of LEDs flashes out some fun dancing patterns. The clock is also programmed to trigger the same display for sixty seconds at the top of each hour.\nIts a straightforward build\u2014what might have been highly complicated to build two decades ago has been simplified with the magic of addressable LEDs. Whats also cool is that this clock was apparently inspired by another project shared on these very pages. If youve been spurred to build something cool yourself, dont hesitate to notify the tipsline!"}

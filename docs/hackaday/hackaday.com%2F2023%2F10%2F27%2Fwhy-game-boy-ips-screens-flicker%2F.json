Ripping out the original screen and dropping in a modern IPS LCD is a popular mod, but that often comes with a weird flicker now and then. [makho] is here to explain why.\nThe problem was that the Game Boy didnt have any way to do transparency in the original hardware. Instead, sprites that were supposed to be a little bit transparent were instead flickered on and off rapidly. The original LCD was so slow that this flicker would be largely hidden, with the sprites in question looking suitably transparent. However, switch to a modern IPS LCD with its faster refresh rate, and the flickering will be readily visible. So its not a bug  its something that was intentionally done by developers that were designing for the screen technology of the 1980s, not the 2020s.\nIPS screens have become the must-have upgrade for modern Game Boy users. Most would tell you the improved image quality and rich color is worth a little flicker here and there.\n\n", "title": "\u300cNintendo Game Boy\u306e\u6539\u9020\u306b\u4f34\u3046IPS LCD\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u300d", "body": "\u5143\u3005\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306f\u6642\u4ee3\u9045\u308c\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eIPS LCD\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u73fe\u8c61\u3082\u8d77\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002IPS\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u753b\u8cea\u3068\u8272\u5408\u3044\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u3001\u591a\u5c11\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u8a31\u5bb9\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cNintendo Game Boy\u306e\u6539\u9020\u306b\u4f34\u3046IPS LCD\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u300d", "\u300cGame Boy\u306e\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068IPS LCD\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8868\u793a\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300cGame Boy\u306e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306e\u610f\u56f3\u3068IPS LCD\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u300d", "\u300c\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306aIPS\u6db2\u6676\u306e\u5fc5\u9808\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u751f\u3058\u308b\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56\u300d", "\u300cGame Boy\u306eIPS\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3068\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5\u300d"]}

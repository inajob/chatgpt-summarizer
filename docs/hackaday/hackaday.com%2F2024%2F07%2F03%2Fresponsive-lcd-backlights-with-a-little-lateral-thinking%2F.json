[Mousa] has a solution, involving a small LCD and a bit of lateral thinking.\nThese screens work by the LCD panel being placed in front of a bright backlight, and only letting light through at bright parts of the picture. Since LCD isnt a perfect attenuator, some of the light can make its way through, resulting in those less than perfect blacks. More recent screens replace the bright white backlight with an array of LEDs that light up with the image, but the electronics to make that happen are not exactly trivial.\nThe solution? Find a small LCD panel and feed it from the same HDMI source as a big panel. Then place an array of LDRs on the front of the small LCD, driving an array of white LEDs through transistor drivers to make a new responsive backlight. Were not sure wed go to all this trouble, but it certainly looks quite cool as you can see below the break.\nThis may be the first responsive backlight weve brought you, but more than one Ambilight clone has graced these pages.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u753b\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "LCD\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306f\u6280\u8853\u7684\u306a\u5947\u8de1\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u9ed2\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306b\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[Mousa]\u306f\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u3068\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u767a\u60f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u540c\u3058HDMI\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u4f9b\u7d66\u3057\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53cd\u5fdc\u578b\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u753b\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "HDMI\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6226\u7565", "\u753b\u8cea\u6539\u5584\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eLCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068LDR\u306e\u914d\u5217", "\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u81ea\u52d5\u5149\u91cf\u8abf\u6574\u6280\u8853"]}

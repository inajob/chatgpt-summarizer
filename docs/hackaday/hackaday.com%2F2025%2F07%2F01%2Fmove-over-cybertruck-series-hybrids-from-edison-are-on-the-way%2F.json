To recap, Edison Motors is a Canadian company building diesel-electric hybrid semi-trucks and more.\nThe last interesting thing to happen in Donald, BC was when it burned down in the 1910s.\nWell, theyve thankfully moved out of the tent in their parents back yard where the prototype was built. Theyve bought themselves a company town: Donald, British Columbia, complete with a totally-not-controversial slogan Make Donald Great Again.\nMore interesting is that their commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), right-to-repair centered approach isnt just for semi-trucks: theyre now a certified OEM manufacturer of a rolling heavy truck chassis you can put your truck cab or RV body on, and they have partnered with three coach-builders for RVs and a goodly number of manufacturing partners for truck conversion kits. The kits were always in the plan, but selling the rolling chassis is new.\nOne amazingly honest take-away from the video is the lack of numbers for the pickups: top speed, shaft horsepower, torque? They know what all that should be, but unlike the typical vaporware startup, Edison wont tell you the engineering numbers on the pickup truck kits until it has hit the race track and proved itself in the real world. These guys are gear-heads first and engineers second, so for once in a long time the adage engineers hate mechanics might not apply to a new vehicle.\nThe dirt track is the first thing under construction in Donald, so hopefully the next update we hear from Edison Motors will include those hard numbers, including pesky little things like MSRP and delivery dates. Stay tuned.\nIn our last post about an electric truck, a lot of you in the comments wanted something bigger, heavier duty, not pure battery, and made outside the USA. Well, here it is.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip. Remember, the lines are always open!"}

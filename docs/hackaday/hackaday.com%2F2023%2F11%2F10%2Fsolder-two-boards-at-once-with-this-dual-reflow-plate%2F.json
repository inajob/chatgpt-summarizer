Add a little code and youre melting solder paste. Sometimes, though, a ground-up design works better, like this scalable reflow plate with all the bells and whistles.\nNow, we dont mean to hate on the many great reflow projects weve seen, of course. But [Michael Benn]s build is pretty slick. The business end uses 400-watt positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heating elements from Amazon controlled by solid-state relays, although we have to note that we couldnt find the equivalent parts on the Amazon US site, so that might be a problem. [Michael] also included mechanical temperature cutoffs for each plate, an essential safety feature in case of thermal runaway. The plates are mounted at the top of a 3D-printed case, which also has an angled enclosure for a two-color OLED display and a rotary encoder.\nThe software runs on an ESP32 and supports multiple temperature profiles for different solder pastes. The software also supports different profiles on the two plates, and even allows for physical expansion to a maximum of four heating plates, or even just a single plate if thats what you need. The video below shows it going through its paces along with the final results. Theres also a video showing the internals if thats more your style\nWe appreciate the fit and finish here, as well as the attention to safety. Cant find those heating elements for your build? You might have to lose your appetite for waffles.\n\n\n", "title": "\u30d9\u30eb\u4ed8\u304d\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "body": "\u30c8\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3084\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u5b89\u5168\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u30aa\u30d5\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001ESP32\u4e0a\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n4\u679a\u307e\u3067\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d9\u30eb\u4ed8\u304d\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c0\u713c\u304d\u6a5f\u3084\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u914d\u616e\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c"]}

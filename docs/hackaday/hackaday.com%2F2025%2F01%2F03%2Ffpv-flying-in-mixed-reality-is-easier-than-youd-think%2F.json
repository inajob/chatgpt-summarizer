Unfortunately, while your wearing the goggles, youre also completely blind to the world around you. Thats why youre supposed to have a spotter nearby to keep watch on the local meatspace while youre looping through the air.\nBut what if you could have the best of both worlds? What if your goggles not only allowed you to see the video stream from your crafts FPV camera, but you could also see the world around you. Thats precisely the idea behind mixed reality goggles such as Apple Vision Pro and Metas Quest, you just need to put all the pieces together. In a recent video [Hoarder Sam] shows you exactly how to pull it off, and we have to say, the results look quite compelling.\n\n[Sam]s approach relies on the fact that theres already cheap analog FPV receivers out there that act as a standard USB video device, with the idea being that they let you use your laptop, smartphone, or tablet as a monitor. But as the Meta Quest 3 is running a fork of Android, these devices are conveniently supported out of the box. The only thing you need to do other than plug them into the headset is head over to the software repository for the goggles and download a video player app.\nThe FPV receiver can literally be taped to the Meta Quest\nWith the receiver plugged in and the application running, youre presented with a virtual display of your FPV feed hovering in front of you that can be moved around and resized. The trick is to get the size and placement of this virtual display down to the point where it doesnt take up your entire field of vision, allowing you to see the FPV view and the actual aircraft at the same time. Of course, you dont want to make it too small, or else flying might become difficult.\n[Sam] says he didnt realize just how comfortable this setup would be until he started flying around with it. Obviously being able to see your immediate surroundings is helpful, as it makes it much easier to talk to others and make sure nobody wanders into the flight area. But he says its also really nice when bringing your bird in for a landing, as youve got multiple viewpoints to work with.\nPerhaps the best part of this whole thing is that anyone with a Meta Quest can do this right now. Just buy the appropriate receiver, stick it to your goggles, and go flying. If any readers give this a shot, wed love to hear how it goes for you in the comments.\n", "title": "- FPV\u98db\u884c\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u73fe\u5b9f\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "body": "FPV\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u3067\u5468\u56f2\u3082\u898b\u3048\u308b\u6df7\u5408\u73fe\u5b9f\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002Meta Quest\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- FPV\u98db\u884c\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u73fe\u5b9f\u30b4\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u5468\u56f2\u3092\u898b\u306a\u304c\u3089FPV\u98db\u884c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Meta Quest\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fFPV\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- FPV\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4eee\u60f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u5b89\u5168\u306aFPV\u98db\u884c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30ae\u30a2\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

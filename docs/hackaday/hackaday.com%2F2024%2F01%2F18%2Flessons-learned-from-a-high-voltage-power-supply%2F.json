And boy, did [Advanced Tinkering] find some things to improve.\nFirst things first: if you havent seen [Advanced]s first pass at a high-voltage supply, you should go check that out. We really liked the design of that one, and were particularly impressed with the attention to detail, all of which seemed to be wisely geared to the safe operation of the supply. But as it turns out, the margin of safety in the original design wasnt as good as it could be. Of most concern was the need to physically touch the supply to control it, an obvious problem should something go wrong anywhere along the HV path, which includes a ZVS-driven flyback and an epoxy-potted Crockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier.\nTo make things a little more hands-off, [AT] added a pneumatically actuated switch to the supply, along with some indicator lights to help prevent him from leaving the supply powered up. He also reworked the low-voltage DC supply section, replacing a fixed-voltage supply and a DC-DC converter with a variable DC supply. This had the side benefit of providing a little bit more voltage to the ZVS driver, which goosed up the HV output a bit. The biggest change, though, was to the potted part of the HV section, which showed signs of arcing to the chassis. It turns out that even at 100% infill, 3D printed PLA isnt a great choice for HV projects; more epoxy was the answer to that problem. Along with rewinding the primary on the flyback transformer, the power supply not only hit the 60-kV spec, but even went a little past that  and all without any of that pesky arcing.\nWe thought [Advanced Tinkering]s first pass on this build was pretty slick, but were glad to see that its even better now. And were still keen to see how this supply will be put to use; honestly, the brief teaser at the end of the video wasnt much help in guessing what it could be.\n\n", "title": "\u3010\u6539\u826f\u7248\u3011\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e60,000V\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u304c50,000V\u306b\u5931\u671b\uff01", "body": "6\u4e07\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u304c50,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u3057\u304b\u51fa\u3055\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c17\u4ed8\u304d\u3001\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3084\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306bDC\u4f9b\u7d66\u90e8\u5206\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001HV\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30b9\u88fdPLA\u306f\u4e0d\u9069\u5207\u3060\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u6a39\u8102\u3067\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u300260kV\u306e\u4ed5\u69d8\u306b\u9054\u3057\u3001\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u793a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u3010\u6539\u826f\u7248\u3011\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e60,000V\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u304c50,000V\u306b\u5931\u671b\uff01", "\u3088\u308a\u5b89\u5168\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u96fb\u6e90\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3010\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac\u3011", "\u30cb\u30aa\u30a4\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305fDIY\u96fb\u6e90", "\u554f\u984c\u306e\u56de\u907f\u3078\u306e\u4e00\u624b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8PLA\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u4f8b\u3010\u6539\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5\u3011", "\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u5411\u4e0a\u3068\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u3010\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u6e90\u3011"]}

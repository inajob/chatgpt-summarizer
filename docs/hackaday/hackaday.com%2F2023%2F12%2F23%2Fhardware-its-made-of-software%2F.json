It\u2019s a very long running series that covers the goings on in the free, libre, and open-source software world. It\u2019s been co-hosted by our own [Jonathan Bennett] for quite a while now, and when This Week in Tech announced that they wanted to cancel it, [Jonathan] asked if he could keep it running over here at Hackaday.\nHackaday is hardware, though. Why would we be hosting a podcast on open software? It\u2019s no secret that a bunch of us are open-source software fans in general here at Hackaday, but take a quick inventory of the various open projects that you use to make and hack your hardware. We use open-source compilers, libraries, and flashing tools to handle the firmware we write on open-source text editors. Heck, half of the time we even program microcontrollers in the open-source MicroPython. We design PCBs in the open-source KiCAD, do CAD/CAM in FreeCAD, and don\u2019t even get me started in the open-source software and firmware underlying the entire 3D printing ecology. Reverse engineering? Free software, from Wireshark straight through to Ghidra.\nAll of this is to say, that even while we\u2019re making or breaking hardware, we\u2019re using open-source software to do it. So, if you\u2019re interested in peeking behind the curtain, give the FLOSS Weekly a listen.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks. It also includes our favorite articles from the last seven days that you can see on the web version of the newsletter.\n\nWant this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning?

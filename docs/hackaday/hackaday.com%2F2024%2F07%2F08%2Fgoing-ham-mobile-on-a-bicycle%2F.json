The radio is a Yaesu FT-891, a workhorse mobile rig covering everything from the 160-meter band to 6 meters. [Wes] used some specialized brackets to mount the radios remote control head to the handlebars, along with an iPad for logging and a phone holder for streaming. The radio plus a LiFePO4 battery live in a bag on the parcel rack in back. The antenna is a Ham Stick mounted to a mirror bracket attached to the parcel rack; wed have thought the relatively small bike frame would make a poor counterpoise for the antenna, but it seems to work fine  well enough for [Wes] to work some pretty long contacts while pedaling around Saskatoon, including hams in California and Iowa.\nThe prize contact, though, was with [WA7FLY], another mobile operator whose ride is even more unique: a 737 flying over Yuma, Arizona. We always knew commercial jets have HF rigs, but it never occurred to us that a pilot whos also a ham might while away the autopilot hours working the bands from 30,000 feet. It makes sense, though; after all, if truckers do it, why not pilots?\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "body": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u306e\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5bb6\u304c\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3057\u3066HF\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u901a\u4fe1\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306f\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30dd4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3082\u53ce\u7d0d\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3082\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u8a71\u984c\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30cf\u30e0\u306e\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3067HF\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "30,000\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda: \u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u8da3\u5473"]}

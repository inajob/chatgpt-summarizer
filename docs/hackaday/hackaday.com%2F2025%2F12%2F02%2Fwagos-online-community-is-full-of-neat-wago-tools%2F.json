The company knows it has a dedicated user base, though, and has established the Wago Creators site for that very community.\nThe idea behind the site is simple\u2014its a place to discover and share unique little tools and accessories for use with Wagos line of electrical connectors. Most are 3D printed accessories that make working with Wago connectors easier. There are some fun and innovative ideas up there, like an ESP8266 development kit that has a Wago connector for all the important pins, as well as a tool for easily opening the lever locks. Perhaps most amusing, though, is the project entitled Hide Your Wago From Americans\u2014which consists of a 3D-printed wire nut lookalike designed to slide over the connectors to keep them out of view. Theres also a cheerful attempt at Wago art, that doesnt really look like anything recognizable at all. Oh well, they cant all be winners.\nIts great to see Wago so openly encouraging creativity among those that use its products. The sharing of ideas has been a big part of the 3D printing movement, and Wago isnt the first company to jump on the bandwagon in this regard.

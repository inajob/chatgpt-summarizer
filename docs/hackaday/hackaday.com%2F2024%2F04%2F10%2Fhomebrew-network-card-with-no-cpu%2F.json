Not only does it do the things required to keep a computer on the network, it can even save the primary CPU from having to do certain common tasks required for communicating. But not [Ivans]. His homebrew computer  comprised of 7 colorful PCBs  now has an eighth card. You guessed it. That card connects to 10BASE-T Ethernet.\nTheres not a microcontroller in sight, although there are RAM chips. Everything else is logic gates, flip flops, and counters. There are a few other function chips, but nothing too large. Does it work? Yes. Is it fast? Umwell, no.\nThe complete computer.\nHe can ping others on the network with an 85 ms round trip and serve web pages from his homebrew computer at about 2.6 kB/s. But speed wasnt the goal here and the end result is quite impressive. He even ported a C compiler to his CPU so he could compile uIP, a networking stack, avoiding the problems of writing his own from scratch.\nSome compromises had to be made. The host computer has to do things you normally expect a network card to do. The MTU is 1024 bytes (instead of the more common 1500 bytes, but TCP/IP is made to expect different MTU sizes, which used to be more common when more network interfaces looked like this one).\nEven on an FPGA, these days, you are more likely to grab some IP to do your Ethernet controller. Rolling your own from general logic is amazing, and  honestly  the design is simpler than we would have guessed. If you check out [Ivan]s blog, you can find articles on the CPU design, its ALU, and even a VGA video card all from discrete logic. The whole design, including the network card is up on GitHub.\nWe love the idea of building a whole computer system soup to nuts. We wish we had the time.

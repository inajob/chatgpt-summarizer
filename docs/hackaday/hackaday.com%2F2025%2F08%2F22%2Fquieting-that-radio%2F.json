But if you are trying to listen to distant or low-powered station, theres a lot of competition. Our modern world is awash in a soup of electronic interference. [Electronics Unmessed] tells  and shows  us how much noise can show up on a SDR setup and what simple things you can do to improve it, sometimes tremendously.\nAccording to the video, the main culprit in these cases is the RF ground path. If you have a single antenna wire, there still has to be a ground path somewhere and that may be through the power line or through, for example, a USB cable, the host computer, and its power supply. Unsurprisingly, the computer is full of RF noise which then gets into your receiver.\nAdding a counterpoise makes a marked difference. A low inductance ground connection can also help. The counterpoise, of course, wont be perfect, so to further turn down the noise, ferrite cores go around wires to block them from being ground paths for RF.\nThe common cores you see are encased in plastic and allow you to snap them on. However, using a bare core and winding through it multiple times can provide better results. Again, thanks to the SDRs display, you can see the difference this makes in his setup.\nNone of this is new information, of course. But the explanation is clear, and being able to see the results in a spectrum display is quite enlightening. Those cores essentially turn your wire into a choke. People think that grounding is simple, but it is anything but.\n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01SDR\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u5bfe\u7b56", "body": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u53d7\u4fe1\u6642\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u5bfe\u7b56\u3084\u6539\u5584\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8aac\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01SDR\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u5bfe\u7b56", "RF\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u6539\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u52b9\u679c\u7d76\u5927\uff01\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30dd\u30a4\u30ba\u3068\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b3\u30a2\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "SDR\u3067\u898b\u308b\uff01\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u524a\u6e1b\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u614b"]}

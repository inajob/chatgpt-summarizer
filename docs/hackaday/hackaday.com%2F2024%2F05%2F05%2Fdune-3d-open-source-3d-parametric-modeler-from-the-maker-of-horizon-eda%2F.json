This is what the author of the Horizon EDA software  [Lukas K.]  struggled with as well when he decided to make his own 3D CAD package, called Dune 3D. Per the documentation for Dune 3D, its effectively the solver and workflow from SolveSpace, the Open CASCADE geometry kernel and the user interface from Horizon EDA wrapped up into a single package.\nSo why not just use FreeCAD or contribute to it? [Lukas]s main gripes appear to be the issues with the topological naming problem (TNP) in FreeCAD, as well as the modal sketcher thats limited to 2D, with no constraints in 3D for extrusions. With the recent version 1.1 release it seems to be picking up new features and fixes, and installing it is very easy on Windows with an installer. For Arch theres an AUR package, and other Linux seems to get a Flatpak if youre not into building the software yourself.\nAs for the UI, its got a definite MacOS vibe to it, with most of the functionality hidden from the main view. Fortunately some tutorials are available to get you started, but it remains to be seen where Dune 3D lands compared to FreeCAD, OnShape and others. As a sidenote, the name is probably not going to help much when asking Google for answers, courtesy of a certain vaguely well-known book with associated movies and series.", "title": "Horizon EDA\u306e\u4f5c\u8005\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u30443D CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cDune 3D\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a", "body": "Horizon EDA\u306e\u958b\u767a\u8005\u304c\u81ea\u8eab\u306e3D CAD\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u300cDune 3D\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002SolveSpace\u306e\u30bd\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u3084Open CASCADE\u306e\u30b8\u30aa\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Horizon EDA\u306eUI\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3002FreeCAD\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u6307\u6458\u3057\u3001Dune 3D\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u3002", "titles": ["Horizon EDA\u306e\u4f5c\u8005\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u30443D CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cDune 3D\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a", "FOSS 3D CAD\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "FreeCAD\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aDune 3D\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "Dune 3D\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "Dune 3D\u306eUI\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

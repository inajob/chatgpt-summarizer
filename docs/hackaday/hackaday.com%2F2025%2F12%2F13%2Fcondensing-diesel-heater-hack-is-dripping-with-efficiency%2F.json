If youre in one of those areas, this latest hack from [Hangin with the Hursts] could save you some change, or keep you\u00a0 \u03362\u03360\u0336%\u0336 \u0336c\u0336o\u0336o\u0336l\u0336e\u0336r\u0336\u00a0 25% warmer on the same fuel burn.\nIts bog simple: he takes his off-the-shelf hydronic diesel heater, which is already 71% efficient according to a previous test, and hooks its exhaust to a heat exchanger. Now, you dont want to restrict the exhaust on one of these units, as that can mess with the air fuel mix, but [Hurst] gets around that with a 3 intercooler meant for automotive intake. Sure, its not made for exhaust gas, but this is a clean-burning heater, and it wouldnt be a hack if some of the parts werent out of spec.\nSince its a hydronic heater, hes able to use the exhaust gas to pre-heat the water going into the burner. The intercooler does a very good job of that, sucking enough heat out of the exhaust to turn this into a condensing furnace. Thats great for efficiency  he calculates 95%, a number so good he doesnt trust it  but not so good for the longevity of the system, since this intercooler isnt made to deal with the slightly-acidic condensation. The efficiency numbers are combustion efficiency, to be clear. Hes only accounting for the energy in the diesel fuel, not the energy that heats the water in his test, for the record; the electrical power going into the blower is considered free. Thats fair, since thats how the numbers are calculated in the heating industry in general  the natural gas furnace keeping this author from freezing to death, for example, is a condensing unit that is also 95% efficient.\nAnother thing you can do to get the most from your diesel heating fuel is add some brains to the operation. Since this is a hydronic system, the cheapest option, long-term, might be to add some solar energy to the water. Sunlight is free, and diesel sure isnt getting any cheaper.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u71c3\u6599\u3067\u6696\u3092\u53d6\u308b\uff01\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u5411\u4e0a\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3067\u52b9\u738795%\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u71c3\u6599\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u71c3\u6599\u3067\u6696\u3092\u53d6\u308b\uff01\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u5411\u4e0a\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u71b1\u4ea4\u63db\u5668\u3067\u6696\u623f\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u6700\u592795%\u306b\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u9060\u9694\u5730\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u8853\u300d", "\u300c\u592a\u967d\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3067\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u6696\u623f\u3092\u8ce2\u304f\u904b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u6696\u623f\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u300d"]}

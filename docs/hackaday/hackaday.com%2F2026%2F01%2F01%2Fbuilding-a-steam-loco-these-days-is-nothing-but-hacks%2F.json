That last fact is down to the redoubtable work by the PRR T1 Steam Locomotive Trust, who continued their efforts to reproduce an example of these remarkable and lamentably unpreserved locomotives in the year 2025.\nThey say that 2025 was the year of the frame because the frame was finally put together. We might say that for the PRR Trust, this was the year of welding. Back when the Baldwin and Altoona works were turning out the originals, the frames for steam locomotives were cast, not welded. There might not be anywhere on Earth to get a 64 long (19.5 m), 71,000 lbs steel casting made these days. Building it up with welded steel might not be perfectly accurate, but its the sort of hack thats needed to keep the project moving.\nThe cylinders, too, would have been bored-out castings back the day. Getting the four (its a duplex, remember) assemblies cast as one piece didnt prove practical, so T1 #5550 will have welded cylinders as well. Given modern welding, we expect no problem with holding steam pressure. The parts are mostly machined and will be welded-together next year.\nThe giant wheels of the locomotive have been cast, but need to be machined. Its not impossible to believe that locomotive #5550 will be on its frame, on its wheels, in 2026. The boiler is already done and the injectors to get water into it have been reinvented, which can perhaps be considered another hack.\nRight now, if donations continue to trickle in at the current rate and prices dont rise any faster than they have been the Trust hopes to have the locomotive steaming in 2030. Shes now 59.8% complete. Thats up from 40% when we last checked in, back in 2022, which is great progress considering this is a volunteer-driven, crowd-funded effort.\nIf you dont have the skills or geographical location to volunteer with this build, but weve peaked your love of steam, perhaps you could 3D print an engine to scratch the itch.\n"}

The latest is a slip ring assembly, and he gives it a teardown to reveal its secrets.\nFor most of us, the only place we encounter a slip ring is in some electric motors or alternators when it provides a connection via a conductive ring and a graphite brush from a fixed component to a rotating one. But they also appear as components in their own right wherever a rotating assembly needs an electrical contact, and its one of these that [Clive] has on his bench. Its a compact unit with an impressive six conductors, and its manufacturer boldly claims that its good for mains voltages. Were going with the verdict in the video below the break. Thats wishful thinking, given the size of the unit.\nInside is a rotor with six brass rings and a couple of decent little bearings, while the other half of the unit is a set of gold-plated spring contacts. There is extensive use of potting, and the verdict is that this is a surprisingly good quality component for the eBay price. We look forward to our community finding inventive uses for them. Having a ready-made unit sure beats making your own.\n\n"}

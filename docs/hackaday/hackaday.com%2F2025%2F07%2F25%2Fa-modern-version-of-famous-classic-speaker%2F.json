Not so in the 1930s. Musicians of the time often had to go to great lengths to generate new types of sounds, and one of the most famous of these was the Leslie speaker, known for its unique tremolo and vibrato. Original Leslies could cost thousands now, though, so [Levi Graves] built a modern recreation.\nThe Leslie speaker itself got its characteristic sound by using two speakers. The top treble speaker was connected to a pair of horns (only one of which produced sound, the other was used for a counterweight) on a rotating platform. The second speaker in the bottom part of the cabinet faced a rotating drum. Both the horns and drum were rotated at a speed chosen by the musician and leading to its unique sound. [Levi] is actually using an original Leslie drum for his recreation but the sound is coming out of a 100-watt mystery speaker, with everything packaged neatly into a speaker enclosure. Hes using a single-speed Leslie motor but with a custom-built foot switch can employ more fine-tuned control over the speed that the drum rotates.\nEven though modern technology allows us to recreate sounds like this, often the physical manipulation of soundwaves like this created a unique feeling of sound that cant be replicated in any other way. Thats part of whats driven the popularity of these speakers throughout the decades, as well as the Hammond organs theyre often paired with. The tone generators on these organs themselves are yet another example of physical hardware providing a unique, classic sound not easily replicated.\n\n", "title": "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001Leslie\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3082\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u97f3\u306f\u552f\u4e00\u7121\u4e8c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u5275\u9020\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "- \u6614\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u98a8\u666f\uff1a1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u3068\u97f3\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u97f3\u306e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u751f\u3080\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u97ff\u304d", "- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

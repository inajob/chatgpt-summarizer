Developed by a company youve probably never heard of\u2014Smith Engineering\u2014it was put into production by General Consumer Electronics, and later sold by Milton Bradley. It was an outright commercial failure, but its remembered for its sharp vector display and oddball form factor.\nThe Vectrex was intended for tabletop use in a home environment. However, [Jeroen Domburg], also known as [Sprite_tm], decided to set about building a portable version. This wasnt easy, but that just makes the development process a more interesting story. Thankfully for us, [Sprite_tm] was kind enough to tell the tale at the 2023 Hackaday Supercon.\n\nVectorlicious\n\nVector graphics were the thing that set the Vectrex apart.\n[Sprite] starts by introducing the audience to the Vectrex, just to make sure everyone understands what was special about this thing. For comaprisons sake, he lines it up against its contemporaries. Back in the early 1980s, the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision had incredibly low resolution video output with big ugly pixels. In contrast, the Vectrex could draw clean, sharp lines with its inbuilt vector-style display.\nBasically, instead of coloring in individual pixels, the Vectrex instead drew lines from point to point on the screen. It was an entirely different way of doing graphics\u2014fast, tidy, and effective\u2014and it was popular in early video arcade games, too. Some Vectrex games even came with plastic overlays to create the impression of color on the screen. Unlike pixel displays, though, this technology didnt really scale well to prettier, more lifelike graphics. Thus after the Vectrex, no other mainstream consoles adopted this technique.\nThe talk cites the awesome Scopetrex project, which lets you play Vectrex games on an oscilloscope.\nFrom there, [Sprite_tm] walks the audience through the hardware of the Vectrex. The architecture is fairly simple, based around a 68A09 CPU, which is a Motorola CPU with some improvements over the earlier 6502. Its paired with some ROM, RAM, and I/O glue logic, and it loads its games off cartridges. Then theres the audio hardware, a digital-to-analog converter for video output, and all the subsequent analog electronics for driving the vector CRT display.\nUnlike a modern console, whats inside the box is no secret. Datasheets and full schematics are publicly available that lay out exactly how the whole thing works. This is hugely valuable for anyone looking to repair a Vectrex\u2014or make a portable one. You dont need to reverse engineer much, since its all laid out for you. Indeed, as [Sprite_tm] notes, a replica motherboard already exists that lets you play Vectrex games on an oscilloscopes XY input.\nBuilding the Portable\nSome people have built small Vectrexes before, by going the emulator route with a Raspberry Pi and a small LCD display. [Sprite] wasnt a fan of this route, as modern pixel LCDs make for jagged diagonal lines because theyre not proper vector displays like the original Vectrex CRT. Thus, to build a more authentic portable Vectrex, [Sprite_tm]s build needed certain parts. On top of replicating the CPU and logic of the Vectrex, he needed to find a small CRT that operate as a proper vector display. Plus, he wanted to build something properly portable\u2014I wanna sit on the bus and then whip it out and play it, he explains.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, finding a suitable CRT was the first big hurdle to clear. [Sprite_tm] mused over using a tube from a Sony Watchman handheld portable TV, but decided against it. He notes that these are fairly rare and valuable, and he didnt want to destroy one for his project. But he still needed a small CRT in a practical form factor, and he found the perfect donor. In the 90s, LCDs were pretty crap and expensive, so apartment video intercoms relied on CRTs instead. Now, these systems are all largely defunct, and he notes you can find old examples of these answerphones for a few dollars online.\nPretty tidy.\nOf course, these answerphone CRTs werent designed for vector operation. However, [Sprite_tm] teaches us how you can convert one to draw straight lines on command instead of scanning like a TV. You can get legit vector operation just by squirting the right voltages into the deflection coils. Of course, getting it to work in practice is a lot harder than you might think, but perseverance got the job done in the end. Understanding the physics involved is useful, too, and [Sprite_tm] explains the theory with an apt comparison between coils and a pig.\nFrom there, the talk explains how the rest of the hardware came together. [Sprite_tm] elected to stuff all the Vectrex magic into an FPGA, which felt cooler than software emulation but was more compact than using all-original chips on a replica mainboard. It lives on a custom PCB that also carries all the necessary electronics to drive the CRT in the desired vector mode.\nThe build also has a cartridge port for playing original Vectrex games. However, for ease of use, [Sprite] also fitted a RISC V CPU, some RAM, and a microSD card for loading ROMs for games that he doesnt own in physical format. Everything was then wrapped up in a custom 3D-printed case thats roughly twice as large as the Nintendo Game Boy Color in length and width\u2014and about four times thicker.\n[Jeroen] built two examples. Theyre very fully featured\u2014they can play both real carts and ROMs off a microSD card.The final result? Its a retrogaming triumph. The display isnt perfect\u2014its flickery, its a little skewed\u2014but thats not so different from the original Vectrex anyway. This thing is portable, its playable, and the vector CRT looks absolutely glorious, as does the case design. These things dont make sense to make, as [Sprite] notes, but we agree with his ultimate assessment\u2014this is art.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30f4\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "body": "Vectrex\u306f1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3067\u3001\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u7248\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30f4\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300c\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30f4\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30d9\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u30f4\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "\u300cCRT\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6b63\u771f\u6b63\u9298\u306e\u30d9\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u300d", "\u300c\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5f62\uff1a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30f4\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6210\u529f\u300d"]}

Early examples were too clunky and limited to be of use to anyone but geeks who wanted to show off their next big thing. The 2005 Fossil Wrist PDA was a prime example: although impressively compact for its time, its limited battery life and poor feature set made it obsolete as soon as it was released. But since it ran on Palm OS, it offered plenty of opportunity for hacking: Palm expert [Cameron Kaiser] has upgraded his Wrist with internet access.\nWhile Palm OS 4 natively supports TCP/IP networking, this component was deleted from the Wrist version to save memory. In any case, the only viable network interface would have been the USB port, which isnt too convenient for a watch. Not to be deterred, [Cameron] worked out a way to add network support back into the Wrist: he used the IR port on a Palm m505 to send a copy of its own network drivers to the watch. This works because both devices run the same basic OS version on the same CPU type; the only drawback is that the network setup dialog doesnt respond correctly to the Wrists different set of buttons.\nSince the Wrist PDA could now establish a PPP connection through its USB port, it was able access the internet using [Cameron]s own Overbite Palm Gopher browser. The browser had to be modified a bit to fit into the Wrists extremely limited RAM area, but the end result was still fully functional.\nOf course, a watch is of limited use if it only works while plugged into a PCs USB port, so [Cameron] also figured out a way to use the same system on the go: he set up a Raspberry Pi 3B with some scripts to automatically start a PPP connection whenever the watch is plugged in, and hooked both devices up to a powerbank. This setup requires a long USB cable running through his sleeve, but we suppose this goes well with the retro-geek style that the Wrist PDA provides anyway.\nWith the USB cable providing power as well as data, [Cameron] didnt need to upgrade his Wrists battery, either. Having just a Gopher browser may seem like a huge limitation, but theres still quite a lot going on inside this text-based world.\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/videoplayback.mp4", "title": "\"2005\u5e74\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u578bPDA\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a: \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u5229\u7528\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\"", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u304c\u60aa\u304f\u3001\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u597d\u304d\u306b\u3057\u304b\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0OS\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fFossil Wrist PDA\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001CAM\u30fcPDP\uff08\u8457\u8005\uff09\u306f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067\u3001Raspberry Pi 3B\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u5916\u51fa\u5148\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\"2005\u5e74\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u578bPDA\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a: \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u5229\u7528\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\"", "\"Palm OS\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u578bPDA\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0: \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\"", "\"\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eGopher\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u95b2\u89a7: \u624b\u9996\u306ePDA\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\"", "\"\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3068\u6642\u8a08\u578bPDA\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b: \u5916\u51fa\u6642\u3082\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\"", "\"\u6642\u8a08\u578bPDA\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4f9b\u7d66: USB\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5229\u7528\""]}

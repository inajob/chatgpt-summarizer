But it was only for maybe the first half-year that it was literally a hack a day. By the 2010s, we were putting out four or more per day, and in the later 20-teens, we settled into our current cadence of eight hacks per day, plus some original pieces over the top. That\u2019s a lot of hacks per day! (But \u201cEight-to-Ten-Hacks-a-Day\u201d just isn\u2019t as catchy.)\nWith that many posts daily, we also tend to reach out to a broader array of interests. Quite simply, not every hack is necessarily going to be just exactly what you are looking for, but we wouldn\u2019t be writing it up if we didn\u2019t think that someone was looking for it. Maybe you don\u2019t like CAN bus hacks, but you\u2019re into biohacking, or retrocomputing. Our broad group of writers helps to make sure that we\u2019ll get you covered sooner or later.\nWhat\u2019s still surprising to me, though, is that a couple of times per week, there is a hack that is actually relevant to a particular project that I\u2019m currently working on. It\u2019s one thing to learn something new every day, and I\u2019d bet that I do, but it\u2019s entirely another to learn something new and relevant.\nSo I shouldn\u2019t have been shocked when Tom and I were going over the week\u2019s hacks on the podcast, and he picked an investigation of injecting spray foam into 3D prints. I liked that one too, but for me it was just \u201clearn something new\u201d. Tom has been working on an underwater ROV, and it perfectly scratched an itch that he has \u2013 how to keep the top of the vehicle more buoyant, while keeping the whole thing waterproof.\nThat kind of experience is why I\u2019ve been reading Hackaday for 21 years now, and it\u2019s all of our hope that you get some of that too from time to time. There is a lot of \u201cnew\u201d on the Internet, and that\u2019s a wonderful thing. But the combination of new and relevant just can\u2019t be beat!

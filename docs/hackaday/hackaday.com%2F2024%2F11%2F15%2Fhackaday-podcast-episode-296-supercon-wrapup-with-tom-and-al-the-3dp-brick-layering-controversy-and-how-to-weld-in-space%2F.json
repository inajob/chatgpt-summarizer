Now that the dust has mostly settled from the 2024 Hackaday Supercon, Al Williams joins Elliot and Tom to compare notes and pick out a few highlights from the event. But before that, the weeks discussion will cover the questionable patents holding back a promising feature for desktop 3D printers, a new digital book from NODE, and the surprisingly limited history of welding in space. Youll also hear about the challenge of commercializing free and open source software, the finicky optics of the James Web Space Telescope, and the once exciting prospect of distributing software via pages of printed barcodes.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDirect MP3 download for offline, easy listening.\n\nEpisode 296 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nBritain\u2019s Oldest Satellite On The Move: A Space Curiosity\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Jon] for guessing this weeks sound, getting lucky with the 20-sided die, and for having the most correct answer to boot!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nBrick Layers: The Promise Of Stronger 3D Prints And Why We Cannot Have Nice Things\nA Beautifully Illustrated Guide To Making\n\nThe Pinouts Book Is Here, And It\u2019s Just What You Need\n\n\nBuilding A DIY Nipkow Disk Display\n\nMechanical Image Acquisition With A Nipkow Disc\n\n\nNASA Announces New Trials For In-Space Laser Welding\nThe End Of Ondsel And Reflecting On The Commercial Prospects For FreeCAD\nWhy The Saturn V Used Kerosene For Its Hydraulics Fluid\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nMaking A Unique Type Of Wind Gauge For Home Assistant Use\nRetrogadgets: Oscilloscope Cameras\nThe Constant Monitoring And Work That Goes Into JWST\u2019s Optics\nWelcome To SubTropolis: The Limestone Mine Turned Climate-Controlled Business Complex\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nHIDman Brings Modern Input To Vintage PCs\nA Brief History Of Cyrix, Or How To Get Sued By Intel A Lot\nTeaching Computers To Read \u2014 Sort Of\n\n\n"}

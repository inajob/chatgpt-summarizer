The TRS-80 series of computers live on and have a loyal following among retro computing enthusiasts. But like all such machines the original hardware is harder to find in 2024, so how about the TRS-80 experience without the failing vintage parts? The FauxTRS from [Jpasqua] is just that, the feel of a Model 3 or Model 4, powered by a Raspberry Pi.\nIn a sense then, this is a very well-designed case for a Raspberry Pi that looks a lot like the Tandy of old. With a modern LCD and keyboard it could just as easily be a normal desktop machine, but when the emulator fires up it does indeed look very much like a small version of the real thing. You can download the STL files from Printables, and for the cost of a few extra parts you can have one too.\nAlternatively, if a faux TRS doesnt do it for you, theres always the chance of making a more real one.", "title": "2024\u5e74\u306b\u3082\u6b8b\u308bTRS-80\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092Raspberry Pi\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "body": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u306eTRS-80\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eFauxTRS\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u3002TRS-80\u306e\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002TRS-80\u306e\u611f\u899a\u304c\u3042\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u6545\u969c\u3059\u308b\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["2024\u5e74\u306b\u3082\u6b8b\u308bTRS-80\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092Raspberry Pi\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bRaspberry Pi\u3067TRS-80\u4f53\u9a13", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u3067\u306eTRS-80\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\u306eTRS-80\u98a8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092Raspberry Pi\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u672c\u7269\u306b\u8fd1\u3044TRS-80\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\uff1a\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u3078"]}

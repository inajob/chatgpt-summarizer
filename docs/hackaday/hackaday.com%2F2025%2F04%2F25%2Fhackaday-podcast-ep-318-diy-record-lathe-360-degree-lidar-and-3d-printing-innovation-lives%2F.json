Our new Robot overlords may have to wait a while before they are fast enough chase us meatbags away, but it demonstrated for us how such competitions can be used to advance the state of the art.\nThe weeks stand-out hacks included work on non-planar slicing to improve strength of 3D prints. Its safe to say that the Cartesian 3D printer has matured as a device, but this work proves theres plenty more in the world of 3D printing to be developed. Then there was a beautiful record cutting lathe project, far more than a toy and capable of producing good quality stereo recordings.\nMeanwhile its always good to see the price of parts come down, and this time its the turn of LIDAR sensors. Theres a Raspberry Pi project capable of astounding resolution, for a price that wouldnt have been imaginable only recently. Finally we retrned to 3D printing, with an entirely printable machine, including the motors and the hot end. Its a triumph of printed engineering, and though its fair to say that you wont be using it to print anything for yourself, we expect some of the very clever techniques in use to feature in many other projects.\nThe weeks cant-miss articles came from Maya Posch with a reality check for lovers of physical media, and Dan Maloney with a history of x-ray detection. Listen to it all below, and youll find all the links at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nStill mourning the death of physical media?\u00a0 Download an MP3 and burn it to CD like its 1999!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 318 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nChina Hosts Robot Marathon\nAnnouncing The Hackaday Pet Hacks Contest\n\nWhats that Sound:\n\nCongrats to [Bultza] for knowing what that sound was better than we did!\nIt was thrusters firing aboard the Dragon (Instagram link)\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\n\n\nNon-planar Slicing Is For The Birds\n\nUnique 3D Printer Has A Print Head With A Twist\n3D Printering: Non-Planar Layer FDM\nA Universal, Non-planar Slicer For 3D Printing Is Worth Thinking About\nImproved And Open Source: Non-Planar Infill For FDM\n\n\nDIY Record Cutting Lathe Is Really Groovy\nA Pi-Based LiDAR Scanner\nThe Evertop: A Low-Power, Off-Grid Solar Gem\nRobot Picks Fruit And Changes Light Bulbs With Measuring Tape\n\nCompliant Robot Gripper Won\u2019t Scramble Your Eggs\nDead Simple Jamming Gripper Design\n\n\nThe Most Printable 3D Printer Yet\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\n\n\n\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nPrinted Perpetual Calendar Clock Contains Clever Cams\nHaircuts In Space: How To Keep Your Astronauts Looking Fresh\nJolly Wrencher Down To The Micron\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\nLow Cost Oscilloscope Gets Low Cost Upgrades\nOpen Source DMR Radio\nA Scratch-Built Commodore 64, Turing Style\nRestoration Of Six-Player Arcade Game From The Early 90s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\n\n\nWhy Physical Media Deserved To Die\nTo See Within: Detecting X-Rays\n\n\n"}

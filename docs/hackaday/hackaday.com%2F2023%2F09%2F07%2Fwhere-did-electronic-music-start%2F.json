Within these pages youll find plenty of synthesisers, chiptune players, and other projects devoted to synthetic sound. Not everyone here is a musician of obsessive listener, but if Hackaday had a soundtrack album were guessing it would be electronic. Along the way, many of us have picked up an appreciation for the history of electronic music, whether its EDM from the 1990s, 8-bit SID chiptunes, or further back to figures such as Wendy Carlos, Gershon Kingsley, or Delia Derbyshire. But for all that, the origin of electronic music is frustratingly difficult to pin down. Is it characterised by the instruments alone, or does it have something more specific in the music itself? Here follows the result of a few months idle self-enlightenment as we try to get tot he bottom of it all.\nWill The Real Electronic Music Please Stand Up?\nIf you own a synthesiser, the Telharmonium is its daddy.\nAnyone reading around the subject soon discovers that there are several different facets to synthesised music which are collectively brought together under the same banner and which at times are all claimed individually to be the purest form of the art. Further to that it rapidly becomes obvious when studying the origins of the technology, that purely electronic and electromechanical music are also two sides of the same coin. Is music electronic when it uses an electronic instrument, when electronics are used to modify the sound of an acoustic instrument, when it is sequenced electronically often in a manner unplayable by a human, or when it uses sampled sounds? Is an electric guitar making electronic music when played through an effects pedal?\nThe history of electronic music as far as it seems from here, starts around the turn of the twentieth century, and though the work of many different engineers and musicians could be cited at its source there are three inventions which stand out. Thaddeus Cahills tone-wheel-based Telharmonium US patent was granted in 1897, the same year as that for Edwin S. Voteys Pianola player piano, while the Russian Lev Termens Theremin was invented in 1919. In those three inventions we find the progenital ancestors of all synthesisers, sequencers, and purely electronic instruments. If it appears weve made a glaring omission by not mentioning inventions such as the phonograph, its because they were invented not to make music but to record it.\nI Never Expected To Find Myself In 1940s Cairo\nEven when weve established the origins of the technology, the same timeline doesnt apply to the music itself. Player pianos spent their lives banging out the show tunes of the day, and even the decidedly modern sound of the theremin found its place as a classical music instrument playing in a similar role to the violin. Perhaps the biggest surprise in all this comes in the foundations of the music wed recognise as being purely electronic coming as late as the middle of the 20th century. The fantastically complex compositions of Conlon Nancarrow for the player piano push the boundaries far past what were used to in a typical sequencer file today, but its in music concr\u00e8te, the assemblage of found sounds enabled by the development of tape and wire recorders, that we find the progenitor of sampled music. Halim El-Dabh recorded The Expression of Zaar on a wire recorder in Cairo in 1944, and for those of us who hear it for the first time nearly eight decades later its lost none of its haunting qualities.\nThis Moog synthesiser wouldnt have been possible without the invention of the transistor. Attila Sz\u00e1sz, CC BY-SA 4.0.\nAs a child of 1970s, the electronic music I grew up on that was part of the broadcasting soundscape and which forms the basis of what wed recognise as electronic music today, sounded nothing like the 1950s avant garde of music concr\u00e8te or the 1930s classical music of Clara Rockmores theremin. Perhaps the most significant event in electronic music history wasnt a technological one but a social one then, because the happy confluence of engineers such as Robert Moog mastering the manipulation of sound fell alongside both the huge social change of the 1960s and the solid state revolution bringing the tech within reach of the common man.\nBy the time I was a teenager and then a student at the end of the 1980s the democratisation process of electronic music was complete, as I or any other kid could have a keyboard or a Commodore Amiga with a sampler on their desk. If the electronic music geeks where I grew up had a star in their midst it was Adamski, who shot to fame with a keyboard and sampler on a stand without the performance of a would-be rockstar, with his name on a reflective UK car number plate.\nIt would be another few decades before Id learn the nuts and bolts of making music this way, because as with amateur radio my interest was in the tech not the usage. In researching this piece then Ive gone over a lot of instruments and techniques that I already knew something about, but the real joy has come in listening to a bunch of obscure compositions from decades past Id never otherwise have been fortunate enough to find. If you come to electronic music via the tech then Id urge you to open up YouTube and get searching as I did. And if youve got a recommendation for something we should be listening to, put it in the comments. Theres way more to the history of electronic music than Popcorn!"}

But if youd tasked us to run any GUI program inside a Linux terminal, wed have said that wasnt possible. But, it turns out, you should have asked [mmulet] who put together term.everything.\nYou might be thinking that of course, you can launch a GUI program from a terminal. Sure. Thats not what this is. Instead, it hijacks the Wayland protocol and renders the graphics as text. Or, if your terminal supports it, as an image. Performance is probably not your goal if you want to do this. As the old saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the dog can sing well; it\u2019s that the dog can sing at all.\u201d\nIf, like us, you are more interested in how it works, theres a write up explaining the nuances of the Wayland protocol. The article points out that Wayland doesnt actually care what you do with the graphical output. In particular,  you could print out the graphics and give them to a league of crochet grandmas to individually tie together every single pixel into the afghan of legend! We expect to see this tested at an upcoming hacker conference. Maybe even Supercon.\nWe generally dont like Wayland very much. We use a lot of hacks like xdotool and autokey that Wayland doesnt like. We also think people didnt understand X11s network abilities until it was too late. If you think of it as only a video card driver, then you get what you deserve. But we have to admit, we are humbled by term.everything.", "title": "\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bGUI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u300cterm.everything\u300d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "Linux\u306e\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067GUI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u300cterm.everything\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002Wayland\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bGUI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u300cterm.everything\u300d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "Linux\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "Wayland\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5883\u754c\u3092\u58ca\u3059\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u8b0e\u306b\u6e80\u3061\u305f\u300cterm.everything\u300d\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u89e3\u8aac\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

If you need more power, why not try an electric conversion?\n[Ron \u201cMr. G\u201d Grosinger] is a high school auto shop and welding teacher who worked with his students to replace the 40 hp gas motor in this Daihatsu Hijet with the 127 hp of a Hyper 9 electric motor. The motor sits in the original engine bay under the cab and is mated to the stock transmission with a custom adapter plate made from plate steel for less than $150. We really appreciate how they left all the electronics exposed to see what makes the conversion tick.\nThe faux battery was made by a foam sculptor friend out of urethane foam shaped with a carving knife and then painted. It slides on a set of unistrut trolleys and reveals the 5 salvaged Tesla battery modules that power the vehicle. The fold down sides of the truck bed allow easy access to anything not already exposed if any tweaking is necessary.\nWeve seen a kei truck become a camper as well or an ebike powered with actual power tool batteries. If youre thinking of your own electric conversion, which battery is best?\n\n", "title": "- \u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u5b66\u751f\u3068\u5171\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ea4\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "- \u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u9078\u3073\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8"]}

Right now, it enumerates the devices on your network and can alert you when anything sketchy joins in. We can totally imagine customizing this to include other network security or health checks, and extending the available facial expressions accordingly.\nYou might not always be thinking about your network, and if youre like us, thats probably just fine. But we love standalone displays that show one thing in an easily digestable manner, and this fits the bill, with a smile."}

Theyre readily available and easy to play with, they work with open source hubs, so whats not to like! As an example, [Circuit Valley] has an IKEA Vallhorn motion sensor for a teardown, its as you might expect, a passive infrared sensor (PIR) sensor coupled with a Zigbee interface.\nInside the ultrasonic welded case is a small PCB and a Fresnel lens on the inside of the top cover, and a small PCB for the electronics. We applaud the use of a Swiss Army knife can opener as a spudger. The interesting part comes in identifying the individual components: the Silicon Labs EFR32MG21 SoC is easy enough, but another mystery 8-pin chip is more elusive. The part number suggests an Analog Devices op-amp for signal conditioning the PIR output, but the pinout seems not to support it and from here we think its too expensive a part for a budget item like this.\nTheres a handy header for talking to the SoC, which wed love to report is open and ready to be hacked, but were not getting too optimistic. Even if not hackable though, were guessing many of you find uses for these things.\n"}

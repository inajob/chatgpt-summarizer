To that end, [msylvain59] has been kind enough to give us a look inside the Elektronika MK-26\u2014a calculator built in the former Soviet Union.\nTheres lots of interesting stuff to see from the get-go. The oddball button pad is covered in Cyrillic symbols, quite alien to those of us more accustomed to the Latin character set. Its also constructed somewhat unlike more familiar models from Western-aligned companies like Casio or Commodore. It also rattles when shaken, which doesnt inspire confidence. Inside, its got old-school brown PCBs without the usual green solder mask, a chunky IC in a weird package, and display is via a power-hungry VFD.\nIt doesnt look so totally alien inside; much of the construction is pretty typical of the mid-1970s, wherever you went around the world. The most striking differences are more in the graphics and visual design than anything else.\nUltimately, there are reasons why manufacturers around the world tend to converge on similar techniques. Generally, its because its more economical or easier to do things a certain way. And yet, we still see regional variances because conditions, technologies, and parts availability varies around the world. This teardown highlights that quite clearly.\nIf youre just getting a taste for Soviet hardware teardowns, youll love this video diving inside a real Soyuz clock.\n\n"}

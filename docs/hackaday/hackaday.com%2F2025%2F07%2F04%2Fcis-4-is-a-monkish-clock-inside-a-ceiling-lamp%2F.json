They were the hackers of the middle ages, establishing monestaries across western Europe that were chock full of hacks including their own numeral system. Cistercian numerals were much more efficient (in spaces and penstrokes) than the Roman numerals they replaced, and even the Arabic numerals that replaced them. A single glyph could record anything from 1 to 9,999. (The Europeans hadnt yet cottoned on to zero.)\nThe Cistertian glyphs reduced to a 44 display.\nDepending how you wanted to count time, a single glyph could be used; it looks like [danjovic] is using the thousands and hundreds portions of the glyph for hours and the tens and ones for minutes. This is all accomplished with a 44 neopixel matrix, run by an Attiny85 Digispark with a DS3231 RTC module keeping time. A slight simplification is required to reduce the glyphs to 44, but we dont think the monks would mind. For those of us who dont wear tonsures, an easy read mode scrolls the time in Arabic numerals. (Which still arent super easy,with only 44 LEDs to display them. See the demo video embedded below and try and guess the time.)\nOne nice quality of life feature is an LDR for ambient light detection, to automatically adjust the neopixels brightness. The hackiest part, which we thought was really clever, is the enclosure: its a cheap LED ceiling light. This provides a diffuser, housing and mounting hardware with decent design for no effort. A 3D-printed mask sits between the diffuser and the LEDs and doubles as a PCB holder. All very elegant.\n[danjovic] did include a buzzer in the design, but does say if its been programed to sound off for matins, nones and vespers. In any case, at least its easier to read than his binary-coded-octal clock that we featured a few years back. This isnt our first look at this number system,so evidently people can read them with practice.\nHave you made or seen a cool clock? Send us a tip. We always have time for clocks.\n"}

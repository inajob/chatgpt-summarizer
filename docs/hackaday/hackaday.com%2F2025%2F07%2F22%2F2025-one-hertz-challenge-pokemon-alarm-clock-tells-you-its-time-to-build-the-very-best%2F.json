How many of us have said Who designed this crap? I could do better with an Arduino! while resisting the urge to drop that new smart doorbell in the garbage disposal?\nIts an all-too familiar thought, and when it passed through [Mathieu]s head while he was resetting the time and changing the batteries in his sons power-hungry Pok\u00e9mon alarm clock for the umpteenth time, he decided to do something about it.\nThe only real design requirement, imposed by [Mathieu]s son, was that the clocks original shell remained. Everything else, including the the controller and antique LCD could go. He ripped out the internals and installed an ESP32, allowing the clock to automatically sync to network time in the event of power loss. The old-school LCD was replaced with a modern, full-color TFT LCD which he scored on AliExpress for a couple of Euros.\nRather than just showing the time, the new display sports some beautiful pixel art by Woostarpixels, which [Mathieu] customized to have day and nighttime versions, even including the correct moon phase. He really packed as much into the ESP32 as possible, using 99.6% of its onboard 4 MB of flash. Code is on GitHub for the curious. All in all, the project is a multidisciplinary work of art, and it looks well-built enough to be enjoyed for years to come.\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

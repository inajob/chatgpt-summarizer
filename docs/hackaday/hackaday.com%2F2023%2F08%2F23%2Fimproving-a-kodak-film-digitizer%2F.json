Theres a special aura around an 8 mm image which electronic recordings dont replicate, plus for film makers theres an attraction to working with real film. Unsurprisingly almost all of the devices used with 8 mm film have ceased to be manufactured, but a few items escaped the cut. Its still possible to buy an 8 mm digitizer for example, and its one of these with a Kodak brand that [Mac84] has. Unsatisfied with its image quality, hes set about tinkering with its firmware to give it some video adjustment possibilities and remove its artifact-prone artificial sharpening.\nHelped by the device having a handy EEPROM from which to extract the code, he was able to recover the firmware intact. From here on he was in luck, because the digitizers Novatek CPU is shared with some dash cams and this had spawned a hacker scene. From there he was able to find the relevant area and adjust those settings, and after a few false starts, re-flash it to the device.\nThe results can be seen in the video below the break, and perhaps reveal much about what we expect from an image in the digital age. The sharpened images look good, until we see untampered versions which are closer to the original.\nIf you dont have a Kodak scanner you can always build one yourself, and meanwhile like many people we are still wondering what happened to that new Super 8 camera they announced in 2018 but never released.\n\n"}

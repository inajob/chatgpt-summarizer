This also includes the peripherals, such as the Z84C10 range of MPUs. These are currently already marked as EoL on stores like Mouser, with Littelfuse noting that the last orders with them can be placed until June 14th of 2024. After that youll have to try your luck with shady EBay sellers and a lucky box of old-new-stock found in the back of a warehouse.\nWhat this effectively means is that after just under 48 years since its launch in 1976, the Zilog Z80 will no longer be available for sale as discrete components, which is likely to primarily impact hobbyists and people who are trying to keep retro systems going. This does not mean that its the end of the road for Z80, however, as the eZ80 will be produced for the foreseeable future.\nThese new chips will of course not come in easy to drop in DIPs, making the challenge of breadboarding your own Z80-based microcomputer that much tougher. Yet one thing that definitely wont happen is any of us witnessing the end of the era of the Z80, 6502 and 8051 architectures.\nThanks to [Techokami] for the tip.", "title": "Zilog (Littelfuse\u5098\u4e0b)\u3001Z80\u88fd\u54c1\u306eEoL\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "Zilog\u793e\u306fZ80\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u7d42\u4e86\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3057\u30012024\u5e746\u670814\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u6ce8\u6587\u53d7\u3051\u4ed8\u3051\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3002eZ80\u306f\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u751f\u7523\u3002Z80\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u7d42\u4e86\u306f\u8da3\u5473\u5bb6\u3084\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "titles": ["Zilog (Littelfuse\u5098\u4e0b)\u3001Z80\u88fd\u54c1\u306eEoL\u3092\u767a\u8868", "Z84C00\u88fd\u54c1\u7fa4\u306e\u7d42\u4e86\u3001\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306f2024\u5e746\u670814\u65e5\u307e\u3067", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3001Z80\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u7d42\u4e86", "eZ80\u751f\u7523\u306f\u7d9a\u304f\u3001\u65b0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306fDIP\u5bfe\u5fdc\u305b\u305a", "Z80\u30016502\u30018051\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\u7d42\u4e86\u306f\u8a2a\u308c\u305a"]}

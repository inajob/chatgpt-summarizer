Putting the wings on a rotor and calling them blades is not a huge step away from that. But theres no reason the wing has to rotate, or for that matter be attached to a fixed platform, in order to generate electricity. Anything that generates lift can be used, and this company is demonstrating that with their kite-powered wind generators.\nLike other wind energy producers that have used kites to generate electricity, this one is similar in that the kite is flown in a figure-8 pattern downwind where it can harness energy the most efficiently, pulling out a tether which is tied to a generator. When fully extended, it is flown to a position where the wind doesnt strike the kite as strongly and the tether is reeled in. Unlike other kite generators weve seen, though, this one is offered as a turnkey system complete with battery backup and housed in a self-contained shipping unit, allowing it to be deployed quickly to be used in situations where something like a diesel generator would be impossible to get or where the fuel cant be obtained.\nThe company, called Kitepower, does note that these arent replacements for traditional wind turbines and would be used more for supporting microgrids. There are still some advantages to using kites over fixed turbine blades though: kites can reach higher altitude where the wind is stronger, and they require less materials for a given amount of energy production, often making them even more environmentally friendly and possibly more economical as well. Surprisingly enough, kites can also be used to generate energy even in places where theres no wind at all.", "title": "\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\uff1a\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u306f\u3001\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u98a8\u529b\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3044\u3001\u9ad8\u3044\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3084\u98a8\u306e\u306a\u3044\u5834\u6240\u3067\u3082\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306b\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u4e00\u4f53\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044\u5834\u6240\u3067\u306e\u5229\u7528\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u98a8\u529b\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u307b\u3069\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u88dc\u52a9\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\uff1a\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\uff1a\u9ad8\u3044\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3067\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u751f\u7523", "\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u98a8\u529b\u767a\u96fb\uff1a\u71c3\u6599\u304c\u624b\u306b\u5165\u3089\u306a\u3044\u5834\u6240\u3067\u3082\u53ef\u80fd", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u652f\u3048\u308b\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u767a\u96fb\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u751f\u7523\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2"]}

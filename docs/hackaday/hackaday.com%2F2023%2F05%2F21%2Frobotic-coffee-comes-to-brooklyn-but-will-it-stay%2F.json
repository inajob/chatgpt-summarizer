Everyone knows it, and [Eater NY] highlights a coffee shop with a robotic server opening in Brooklyn. While robots able to prepare and serve drinks or food is not new, it isnt every day a brick-and-mortar caf\u00e9 with a robot behind the counter opens up. But expensive automation isnt the only puzzle piece needed to make a location work.\nA robotic coffee shop (like a robotic burger joint) certainly offers novelty, but can it sustain itself beyond that?\nAs one example, the linked article above points out that the city of New York prohibits entirely cashless businesses. Establishments must accept cash payments, and its unclear how the touchscreen-driven system would comply with that requirement.\nThere are also many tasks involved in running even a modest establishment  loading, cleaning, and maintaining for example  that cant be realistically taken care of by an immobile robot barista. Its unclear to what extent the robotic coffee shop will employ human staff, but its clear that human involvement is something that isnt going be eliminated any time soon.\nSome of you may remember the robotic burger joint that our own Brian Benchoff managed to check out, and many of his same observations come to mind. The robot burger was perhaps ahead of its time (its single location is listed as closed on Google maps with no recent activity) but maybe the robot coffee place can make it work. Still, expensive automation is only one piece of a system, and the ability to crank out a drink per minute 24/7 might not actually be the missing link.", "title": "\"\u30d6\u30eb\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\"", "body": "\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u306b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u3067\u3082\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b58\u5728\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306f\u73fe\u91d1\u3092\u542b\u3081\u305f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u89e3\u6c7a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u6383\u9664\u3084\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4eba\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u4e8b\u4f8b\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u304c\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u304b\u306f\u672a\u78ba\u8a8d\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u30d6\u30eb\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\"", "\"\u73fe\u91d1\u4e0d\u53ef\u306e\u304a\u5e97\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u3069\u3046\u306a\u308b\uff1f\"", "\"\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4eba\u4e8b\u3092\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u4ee3\u66ff\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\"", "\"\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d0\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u6027\"", "\"\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306f\u5e97\u8217\u904b\u55b6\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u5fc5\u8981\u4e0d\u53ef\u6b20\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f\""]}

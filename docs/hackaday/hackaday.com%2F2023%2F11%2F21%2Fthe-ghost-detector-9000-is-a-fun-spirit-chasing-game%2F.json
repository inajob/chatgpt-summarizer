Case in point, the Ghost Detector 9000 from [Jules].\nEffectively, what youre looking at here is a fun interactive ghost-detecting game. It consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero hooked up with an IMU sensor that can detect the rigs movement and orientation. As the user moves the Ghost Detector 9000 around, it outputs lights and sound when its aimed at a so-called ghost-signal. The user then pulls the trigger to capture the ghost. The whole rig is built inside a flashlight which presented a useful form factor for modification.\nFor those eager to dive into the nitty-gritty, [Jules] has shared the project files on GitHub. Theres some nifty stuff going on, like Rust code that interfaces with I2C devices hooked up to the Pi, and a sensor-fusion algorithm to make the most out of the data from the 9-axis IMU.\nIts a fun build that probably taught [Jules] a great deal along the way, even if its a game at heart. If you prefer to shoot zombies instead of capture ghosts, weve seen a build that lets you go hunting with a laser crossbow, too.\n\n"}

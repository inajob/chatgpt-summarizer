While theyre fun to build out of tiny little blocks, theyre a little small for use as your main Christmas tree. Sadly, a bigger version simply doesnt exist in the Lego catalogue, so if thats your desire, youll have to build your own\u2014as [Ruth] and [Ellis] did!\nThe concept behind the build is as youd expect. The duo effectively just 3D printed giant versions of Lego pieces, with which they then assembled a large Christmas tree. It sounds very straightforward, but scaling an existing Lego design up by six times tends to come with some complications. A tactical decision was made early on to ease proceedings\u2014the original Lego tree had a large brown base that would take lots of printing. This was eliminated in the hopes that it would speed the build significantly. The long plastic shafts that supported the original Lego design were also replaced with steel shafts since printing them would have been incredibly difficult to do well.\nThe rest of the video demonstrates the huge amount of work that went into actually 3D printing and assembling this thing. Its pretty great to watch, and youll learn a lot along the way.\nWeve seen other creators try similar projects, where they 3D print their own building blocks from scratch. It normally turns out much harder than expected! No surprise when you think about all the engineering that went into perfecting Lego all those years ago. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Jonathan for the tip!]", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5927\u304d\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u72ec\u81ea\u306b\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01 LEGO\u306e\u62e1\u5927\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "- \u8907\u96d1\u306a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3092\u7d4c\u3066\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc", "- LEGO\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01 \u5927\u578b\u4f5c\u54c1\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

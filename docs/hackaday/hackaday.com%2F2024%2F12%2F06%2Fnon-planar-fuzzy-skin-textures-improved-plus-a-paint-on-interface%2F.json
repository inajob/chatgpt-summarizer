Most slicers have it as an option, but limit the wiggling action of the print head needed to achieve it to the XY plane. Recently, [TenTech] released post-processing scripts for three popular slicers that enable non-planar fuzzy skin by wiggling the print head in the Z-axis, allowing you to texture upward-facing surfaces.\nThe first half of the video below goes through [TenTech]s updates to that work that resulted in a single script that can be used with any of the slicers. Thats a pretty neat trick by itself, but not content to rest on his laurels, he decided to make applying a fuzzy skin texture to any aspect of a print easier through a WYSIWYG tool. All you have to do is open the slicers multi-material view and paint the areas of the print you want fuzzed. The demo print in the video is a hand grip with fuzzy skin applied to the surfaces that the fingers and palm will touch, along with a little bit on the top for good measure. The print looks fantastic with the texture, and we can see all sorts of possibilities for something like this.\n\n\nThanks for the tip, [John].", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8868\u73fe\u3092\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "3D\u5370\u5237\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8868\u73fe\u3092\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Z\u8ef8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u306e\u65bd\u3057\u65b9", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01WYSIWYG\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u5370\u5237\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u5411\u4e0a", "- 3D\u5370\u5237\u306e\u8868\u9762\u3092\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a1\u30b8\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

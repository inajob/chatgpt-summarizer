You know, the kind where you answer a question and go to a new page based on your answer. But they can also be entertaining choose your own adventure stories. You might say, You are standing in front of an oak door, two meters high, with an iron handle. Do you a) open it? b) knock on it? c) ignore it? Then, based on your answer, you go to a different part of the story. These are tough to write, but you can get some help using Yarn Spinner and the Yarn scripting language.\nThe original purpose of Yarn is to produce conversations for games. Theres a tutorial for that. The difference is to produce a book, you get a choose your own adventure PDF at the end. For the tutorial, you can try to read the text on the left-hand side of the editor or just press Test (at the top) and let it read the tutorial to you, which is a little more fluid.\n\nThe scripting language is mostly text, but you can have branching logic, which is critical for the book generation. You can also set variables as in:\nset $gold to 5\nThen you can test variables with if as you might expect. You can also jump to other parts of the script using jump. This works with nodes that look like this:\ntitle: HackadayNode\n---// Yarn script goes here===\nThats about it. We took the liberty of writing a cheeky Hackaday adventure. The source code is available, too. Youll notice the script is simplistic. It doesnt merge the lines, so if you have, say, three jumps to node X, you will get three copies of node X in the book. Then again, that helps your page count, and it doesnt distract from the enjoyment of the finished product. And, yes, we added the title graphic after the fact.\nIt should be possible to write programmed instruction material with this, too. Why just pretend to submit a project to Hackaday when you could do it for real so easily?", "title": "Yarn Spinnner\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u578b\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u9078\u629e\u578b\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Yarn Spinner\u3068Yarn\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u66f8\u3051\u308b\u3002\u8907\u96d1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u3084\u9078\u629e\u578bPDF\u3092\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fHackaday\u5192\u967a\u3082\u53c2\u7167\u53ef\u3002", "titles": ["Yarn Spinnner\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u578b\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "Yarn scripting language\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u4f1a\u8a71\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u578bPDF\u306e\u751f\u6210", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aYarn Spinnner\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u578bPDF\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

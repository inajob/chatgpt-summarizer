Obviously, you cant sidestep the acquisition of the processor\u2014unless you emulate\u2014but what about replacing the IMS C011/C012 link chip? You need this (expensive) part to interface the transputer to the programming host, but as [Erturk Kocalar] discovered, its perfectly possible to coax a Teensy to do that job for you just as well.\nThe unusual two-bit start sequence differentiates a data packet from an ACK. Its simple to emulate if you use the LSB of a 9-bit word as a dummy start bit!\nTransputers work by utilizing an array of bit serial interfaces to connect a network of devices, allowing for cooperative computation on tasks too large to fit on a single device. This protocol is, at its link level, a simple asynchronous bit serial affair, with 11-bit data messages, and a raw two-bit frame for the acknowledge. The C011 device at its heart is just a specialized UART\u2014it takes 8-bit parallel data from the host, dealing with handshaking, and pushes it out to the first transputer in the chain at 5, 10 or 20 Mbps, but inverted and with two start bits and a single stop bit. In parallel, it performs the same task in the reverse direction.\n[Erturk] realized that the Teensy UART has an inverted mode and, crucially, a 9-bit data mode. This allows the second start bit to be generated as bit 0 of the word, with the remaining eight bits forming the payload. Simple stuff. Additionally, the Teensy UART is capable of the maximum transputer bitrate of 20 Mbps, without breaking a sweat.\n\nThere is a slight issue, however, in that there is no way to send or receive the two-cycle acknowledgement frame directly. Since the protocol stop bit is a low, it is possible to implement this by simply sending a dummy data word with all 9 data bits low (since the acknowledge is a 1, 0 pattern). In one specific corner case, that of a direct memory PEEK operation, the command is clocked into the transputer, which sends back a two-cycle ACK\u2014almost immediately followed by the 11-cycle data packet with the result. But, since the Teensy UART is still busy fake decoding the full 11-bit dummy ACK message, it will miss the data packet entirely.\nIt turns out that the easiest way to get around this is to speed up the link and run at the maximum 20 Mbps rate. That way, the Teensy will have fully received the overly-long ACK long before the transputer has completed the PEEK command and started to send over the result. Why you would voluntarily run the link slower escapes us, once youd got the design dialled in and reliability was a given, anyway.\nWe like transputers, a cool technology that died too soon. Heres a quick guide to these innovative devices. Some people are really into transputer hardware, like this person. Finally, with the genuine hardware finicky to work with, expensive and hard to find, you could play along with your trusty web browser, and tick it off your nerdy bucket list.", "title": "- Teensy\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fInmos Transputer\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u7f6e\u63db\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u53e4\u3044Inmos Transputer\u306f\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u304c\u3001Teensy\u3067\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4ee3\u66ff\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- Teensy\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fInmos Transputer\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u7f6e\u63db\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\uff01Transputer\u3068Teensy\u3067\u306e\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "- Transputer\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\uff1aACK\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- Teensy UART\u306e9\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fTransputer\u63a5\u7d9a\u6cd5", "- Transputer\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6848"]}

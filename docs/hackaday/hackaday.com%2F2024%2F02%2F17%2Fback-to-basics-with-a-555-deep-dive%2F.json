Its really not that hard, which is a bit strange considering how flexible the ubiquitous chip is, and how many ways it can be wired up. But when was the last time you sat down and really thought about what goes on inside that little fleck of silicon?\nIf its been a while, then [DiodeGoneWild]s back-to-basics exploration of the 555 is worth a look. At first glance, this is just a quick blinkenlights build, which is completely the point of the exercise. By focusing on the simplest 555 circuits, [Diode] can show just what each pin on the chip does, using an outsized schematic that reflects exactly whats going on with the breadboarded circuit. Most of the demos use the timer chip in free-running mode, but circuits using bistable and monostable modes sneak in at the end too.\nYes, this is basic stuff, but theres a lot of value in looking at things like this with a fresh set of eyes. Were impressed by [DiodeGoneWild]s presentation; while most 555 tutorials focus on component selection and which pins to connect to what, this one takes the time to tell you why each component makes sense, and how the values affect the final result.\nCurious about how the 555 came about? Weve got the inside scoop on that.\n\n", "title": "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fcIC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "body": "555\u56de\u8def\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u67d4\u8edf\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u914d\u7dda\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3042\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\u3002[DiodeGoneWild]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a555\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\u306f\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5149\u306e\u70b9\u6ec5\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u5404\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3084\u56de\u8def\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fcIC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u4e0a\u3067\u306e555\u56de\u8def\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fcIC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u56de\u8def\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u30e2\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fcIC\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

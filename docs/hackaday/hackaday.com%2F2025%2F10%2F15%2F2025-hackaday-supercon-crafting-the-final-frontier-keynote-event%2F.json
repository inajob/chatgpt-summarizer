In 950 episodes across the twelve television series that have carried the name, the franchise has made a spectacle not of explosions and machismo, but of competent professionals working together to solve complex problems. In the world of Star Trek, the coolest people in the room are the scientists, engineers, physicists, and doctors  is it any wonder so many in the sciences credit the show for putting them on their career path?\nHardware hacker, maker, and Trekkie Andrew [MakeItHackin] will lead the panel.To celebrate the impact of Star Trek, were proud to announce our keynote event for the 2025 Hackaday Supercon: Crafting the Final Frontier. This round-table discussion led by Andrew [MakeItHackin] will bring together some of the artists that have helped cultivate the look and feel of the final frontier since Star Trek: The Next Generation and all the way into the modern era with Star Trek: Picard.\nWhile the art direction of the original Star Trek series from 1966 was remarkably ahead of its time, these are some of the key individuals who were brought in to refine those early rough-hewn ideas into cultural touchstones. Their work ended up becoming more than simple entertainment, and ultimately helped inspire some of the real-world technology we use on a daily basis. The iconic LCARS computer interface predicted the rise of the touch screen, while its impossible to look at props such as the PADD and Tricorder and not see the parallels with modern tablets and smartphones.\n\nThe following Star Trek veterans are set to join us at Supercon 2025:\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Okuda\nMichael Okuda invented the iconic \u201cLCARS\u201d graphic style for Star Trek.

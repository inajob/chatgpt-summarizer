Were not sure weve quite seen the like of [Jonathan R]s video walkie talkie before though, a pair of units which as you might guess, deliver two-way video and audio communications.\nThe trick involves not one but two ESP32s: an ESP32-S3 based camera module, and a more traditional Tensilica ESP32 in a screen module. Its an opportunity for an interesting comparison, as one device uses the Cheap Yellow Display board, and the other uses an Elecrow equivalent. The audio uses ESP-NOW, while the video uses WiFi, and since the on-board audio amplifiers arent great, theres a small amp module.\nThe video below has a comprehensive run-down including the rationale behind the design choices, as well as a demonstration. Theres a small lag, but nothing too unacceptable for what is after all an extremely cheap device. Perhaps after all this time, the video phone has finally arrived!\n\n"}

Were not sure weve quite seen the like of [Jonathan R]s video walkie talkie before though, a pair of units which as you might guess, deliver two-way video and audio communications.\nThe trick involves not one but two ESP32s: an ESP32-S3 based camera module, and a more traditional Tensilica ESP32 in a screen module. Its an opportunity for an interesting comparison, as one device uses the Cheap Yellow Display board, and the other uses an Elecrow equivalent. The audio uses ESP-NOW, while the video uses WiFi, and since the on-board audio amplifiers arent great, theres a small amp module.\nThe video below has a comprehensive run-down including the rationale behind the design choices, as well as a demonstration. Theres a small lag, but nothing too unacceptable for what is after all an extremely cheap device. Perhaps after all this time, the video phone has finally arrived!\n\n", "title": "ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30c8\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u53cc\u65b9\u5411\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u901a\u8a71\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u97f3\u58f0\u306fESP-NOW\u3001\u6620\u50cf\u306fWiFi\u3067\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30c8\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc", "\u4e8c\u3064\u306eESP32\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u53cc\u65b9\u5411\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u901a\u4fe1", "\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u901a\u8a71\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "ESP32-S3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "WiFi\u3068ESP-NOW\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u30fb\u6620\u50cf\u901a\u4fe1\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

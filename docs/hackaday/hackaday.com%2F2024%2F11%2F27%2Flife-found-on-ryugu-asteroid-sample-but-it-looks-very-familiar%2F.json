Inside the cleanest of clean rooms, a tiny particle was collected from the returned sample with sterilized tools in a nitrogen atmosphere and stored in airtight containers before being embedded in an epoxy block for scanning electron microscopy.\nIts hard to imagine what more one could do, but despite all the precautions taken, the samples were\u00a0rapidly colonized by terrestrial microorganisms. Only the upper few microns of the sample surface, but it happened. Thats what the images above show.\nThe surface of Ryugu from Rover 1Bs camera. Source: JAXA\nObtaining a sample from asteroid Ryugu was a triumph. Could this organic matter have come from the asteroid itself? In a word, no. Researchers have concluded the microorganisms are almost certainly terrestrial bacteria that contaminated the sample during collection, despite the precautions taken.\nYou can read the study to get all the details, but it seems that microorganisms  our worlds greatest colonizers  can circumvent contamination controls. No surprise, in a way. Every corner of our world is absolutely awash in microbial life. Opening samples on Earth comes with challenges.\nAs for off-Earth, robots may be doing the exploration but despite NASA assembling landers in clean room environments we may have already inadvertently exported terrestrial microbes to the Moon, and Mars. The search for life to which we are not related is one of science and humanitys greatest quests, but it seems life found on a space-returned samples will end up looking awfully familiar until we step up our game.", "title": "- \u5c0f\u60d1\u661f\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30b0\u30a6\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u306e\u6b63\u4f53", "body": "\u5c0f\u60d1\u661f\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30b0\u30a6\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306f\u5730\u7403\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u306b\u6c5a\u67d3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u60d1\u661f\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30b0\u30a6\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u306e\u6b63\u4f53", "- \u53b3\u91cd\u306a\u5bfe\u6c5a\u67d3\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u4e0b\u3067\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306e\u63a1\u53d6\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30b0\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306b\u4fb5\u5165\u3057\u305f\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u5b87\u5b99\u63a2\u7d22\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56", "- \u5730\u7403\u5916\u751f\u547d\u63a2\u67fb\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\uff1a\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u6c5a\u67d3\u306e\u73fe\u5b9f"]}

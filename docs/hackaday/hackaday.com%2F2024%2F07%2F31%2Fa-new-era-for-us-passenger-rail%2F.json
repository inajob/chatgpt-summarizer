The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has just released a story map of how the US could close the gap (a little).\nThe Corridor Identification and Development (CID) Program is a way for FRA to provide both funding and technical assistance as corridor sponsors (mostly state Departments of Transportation) evaluate either new intercity service or expansion of existing services. While it isnt a guarantee of anything, it is a step in the right direction to rebuilding passenger rail capacity in the US.\nSome cities would be getting rail service back for the first time in decades, and perhaps even more exciting is that several of the routes being studied are for high speed rail primarily or solely on new trackage. As any railfan can tell you, vintage rails arent the best for trains going fast (sorry, Acela). With recent polling showing strong public support for the build out of high speed rail, its an exciting time for those who prefer to travel by rail.\nWe dont think youll be able to ride a gyro monorail, nuclear-powered, or jet train on these proposed routes, but we do hope that Amtrak and FRA are looking to the state-of-the-art when it comes to those high speed alignments. While youre eagerly awaiting new passenger service, might we recommend this field guide to what all those different freight cars going by are for here in North America?"}

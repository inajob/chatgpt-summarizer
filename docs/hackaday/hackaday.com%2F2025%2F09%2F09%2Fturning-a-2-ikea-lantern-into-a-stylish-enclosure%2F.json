Some of those builds will be spaghetti on a breadboard, but at some point youll probably have a project that needs a permanent case. If youre looking for a small case for your latest creation, check out [Julius Curts] modification of an IKEA V\u00e5rsyren lantern into a customizable enclosure!\n\n\nLike most things IKEA, the V\u00e5rsyren lantern is flat pack  but rather than coming as a collection of wooden components, the lantern is made of sheet metal. Its hexagonal in shape with a pair of three sided panels, so [Curt] simply snaps one of them off to make three sides of the final case. The other three sides are 3D printed with the STEP files provided so the case can be made to fit anything around 60x60x114 mm in size.\nIf flat pack hacking is up your alley, make sure to check out this IKEA 3D printer enclosure next!\n\nThanks [Clint] for the tip!"}

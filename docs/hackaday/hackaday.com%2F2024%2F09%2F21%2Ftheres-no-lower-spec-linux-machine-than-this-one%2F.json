Perhaps after seeing this project though, youll never again complain about that two-generations-ago 64-bit multi-core behemoth, because [Dimitri Grinberg]  who else!  has succeeded in booting an up-to-date Linux on the real most basic of processors. Were not talking about 386s, ATmegas, or 6502s, instead hes gone right back to the beginning. The Intel 4004 was the first commercially available microprocessor back in 1971, and now it can run Linux.\nSo, given the 4004s very limited architecture and 4-bit bus, how can it perform this impossible feat? As you might expect, the kernel isnt being compiled to run natively on such ancient hardware. Instead hes achieved the equally impossible-sounding task of writing a MIPS emulator for the venerable silicon, and paring back the emulated hardware to the extent that it remains capable given the limitations of the 1970s support chips in interfacing to the more recent parts such as RAM for the MIPS, an SD card, and a VFD display. The result is shown in the video below the break, and even though its sped up its clear that this is not a quick machine by any means.\nWed recommend the article as a good read even if youll never put Linux on a 4004, because of its detailed description of the architecture. Meanwhile weve had a few 4004 stories over the years, and this ones not even the first time weve seen it emulate something else.\n\n", "title": "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306e\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3067Linux\u3092\u8d77\u52d5 - \u30a6 \u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "1971\u5e74\u306b\u6700\u521d\u306b\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb4004\u304cLinux\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u30024\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u3067\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001MIPS\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u7a3c\u50cd\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u901f\u5ea6\u306f\u9045\u3044\u304c\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u8a18\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306e\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3067Linux\u3092\u8d77\u52d5 - \u30a6 \u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8", "\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb4004\u3067Linux\u306e\u5b9f\u884c\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb4004\u3068MIPS\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1aLinux\u306e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eLinux\u3092\u4f53\u9a13", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb4004\u3067\u306eLinux\u5b9f\u884c\u306b\u6311\u6226"]}

Aside from the cranberries, Thanksgiving is probably one of my favorite holidays because of the spirit behind it \u2013 thinking about what\u2019s gone well, how you lucked out, and who has done you right over the year.\nOne of the most poignant expressions of thanks I\u2019ve heard in a while came from Hackaday superfriend [Sprite_tm] in his Supercon talk this year, which he closed by thanking \u201cyou all\u201d for pushing him on to keep making crazy projects. \u201cI would never finish these projects without people who would be entertained by seeing all this. This is is effectively art \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t make sense. The only way it makes sense is because I want it to exist, and because I know that you all love hearing and reading about stuff like this existing. So thank you very much for that.\u201d\nThat same sentiment goes for all of us here at Hackaday: Thank you all very much for reading! Without this global community of crazy hackers to write for, we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep doing what we do \u2013 it just wouldn\u2019t make sense. And without your hacks, of course, we\u2019d have nothing to write about.\nThanks for sharing, thanks for following along, thanks for inspiring us and for being inspired. Thanks for hacking.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

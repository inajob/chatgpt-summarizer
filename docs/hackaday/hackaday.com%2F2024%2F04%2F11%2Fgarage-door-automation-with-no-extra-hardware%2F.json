Building computers to handle minutiae so we dont have to is one of lifes great joys. Among the more popular is adding some sort of system to a garage door. Besides adding Internet-connected remote control to the action of opening and closing, its also helpful to have an indicator of the garage door state for peace-of-mind. Most add some sensors and other hardware to accomplish this task but this project doesnt use any extra sensors or wiring at all.\nIn fact, the only thing added to the garage door for this build besides some wiring is the microcontroller itself. After getting the cover of the opener off, which took some effort, a Shelly Uni was added and powered by the 12V supply from the opener itself. The garage door opener, perhaps unsurprisingly, has its own way of detecting when the door is fully open or closed, so some additional wire was added to these sensors to let the microcontroller know the current state. Shelly Uni platforms have a WiFi module included as well, so nothing else was needed for this to function as a complete garage door automation platform.\n[Stephen] uses Home Assistant as the basis for his home automation, and he includes all of the code for getting this platform up and running there. It wouldnt be too hard to get it running on other openers or even on other microcontroller platforms; the real key to this build is to recognize that sometimes its not necessary to reinvent the wheel with extra sensors, limit switches, or even power supplies when its possible to find those already in the hardware youre modifying. This isnt always possible, though, especially with more modern devices that might already be Internet-connected but probably dont have great security.", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u306b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u4ee5\u6765\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u4f59\u5206\u306a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30fb\u914d\u7dda\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u305b\u305a\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30b7\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u30e6\u30cb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u6249\u306e\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30c9\u30a2\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3084\u914d\u7dda\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u5b85\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0"]}

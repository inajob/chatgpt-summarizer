The currently developed architecture, Kunminghu, is impressive, with a sophisticated instruction fetch unit, a reorder buffer, and a register renaming scheme.\nThe point of these types of circuits in a CPU is to allow multiple instructions to process at once. This also implies that instructions can be executed out of order. A cursory glance didnt show any branch prediction logic, but that may be a limitation of the documentation. If there isnt one, that would be an interesting thing to add in a fork if you are looking for a project.\nOn the computing side, the processor contains an integer block, a floating point unit, and a vector processor. Clearly, this isnt a toy processor and has the capability to compete with serious modern CPUs.\nThere is a separate GitHub for documentation. It looks like they try to keep documentation in both Mandarin and English. You can also find some of the academic papers about the architecture there, too.\nWe love CPU design, and this is an interesting chance to contribute to an open CPU while there are still interesting things to do. If you need to start with something easier, plenty of small CPUs exist for educational purposes."}

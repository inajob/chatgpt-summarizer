This is due to it combining the best of the only good programming language (Prolog) with the best of the only useful programming language (C). Although the resulting mash-up syntax that results may trigger Objective-C flashbacks, its actually valid SWI-Prolog, that is subsequently converted to C for compilation.\nLanguage flamewars aside, the motivation for C+P as explained in the projects README was mostly the exploring of macros in a system programming language. More specifically, by implementing a language-within-a-language you can add just about any compile-time feature you want including  as demonstrated in C+P  a form of generics. Even as a way to have a bit of fun, C+P comes dangerously close to being a functional prototype. Its main flaw is probably the lack of validation and error messages, which likely leads to broken C being generated.\nAlso mentioned are the Nim and Haxe languages which can be compiled (transpiled) to C or C++, which is somewhat of a similar idea as C+P, as well as cmacro (based on Common Lisp) and the D language.", "title": "C Plus Prolog (C+P): \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "C Plus Prolog\uff08C+P\uff09\u306fProlog\u3068C\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305f\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u3001\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u63a2\u6c42\u304c\u76ee\u7684\u3002\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30d0\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4e0d\u8db3\u304c\u6b20\u70b9\u3002", "titles": ["C Plus Prolog (C+P): \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a00\u8a9eC+P\uff1aProlog\u3068C\u306e\u7d71\u5408", "C+P\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aC+P\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4ef2\u9593\u305f\u3061", "C+P\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u8ab2\u984c\uff1a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u6642\u306e\u7279\u9577\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42"]}

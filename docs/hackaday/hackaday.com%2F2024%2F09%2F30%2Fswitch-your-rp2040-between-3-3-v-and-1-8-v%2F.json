Bad news,\u00a0 everything also means adding 1.8 V GPIO voltage support. The good news is that this write-up by [xenia] explains the process of adding a 3.3 V/1.8 V slide switch onto your board.\nSome parts are obvious, like the need to pick a flash chip that works at either voltage, for instance. Unfortunately, most of them dont. But theres more youd be surprised by, like the crystal, a block where the recommended passives are tuned for 3.3 V, and you need to re-calculate them when it comes to 1.8 V operation  not great for swapping between voltages with a flick of a switch. Then, you need to adjust the bootloader to detect the voltage supplied  thats where the fun begins, in large part. Modifying the second stage bootloader to support the flash chip being used proved to be quite a hassle, but were graced with a working implementation in the end.\nAll the details and insights laid out meticulously and to the point, well-deserved criticism of Raspberry Pi silicon and mask ROM design choices, code fully in Rust, and a success story in the end  [xenia]s write-up has all you could wish for.\nWant to learn more about the RP2040s bootloader specifically? Then check this out  straight out of Cornell, a bootloader thats also a self-spreading worm. Not only is it perfect for updating your entire RP2040 flock, but it also teaches you everything you could want to know about RP2040s self-bringup process.", "title": "RP2040\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b1.8V GPIO\u96fb\u5727\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "RP2040\u30c7\u30a3\u30d9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u969b\u306b\u30011.8V GPIO\u96fb\u5727\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u90e8\u306a\u3069\u3001\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u90e8\u5206\u3082\u89e6\u308c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5de5\u7a0b\u3092\u8a73\u7d30\u306b\u8aac\u660e\u3002Rust\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u8a18\u8ff0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3082\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["RP2040\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b1.8V GPIO\u96fb\u5727\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "RP2040\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u75283.3V/1.8V\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u624b\u9806", "RP2040\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b1.8V\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9078\u5b9a", "RP2040\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u5727\u691c\u51fa\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5", "RP2040\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u5df1\u5897\u6b96\u30ef\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u5b66\u3076\u81ea\u5df1\u8d77\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9"]}

Yeah, the whole instrument cluster is on [David]s Volvo PV544 is nixified, and were here for it.\n\nHes using a mixture of tubes here the big ones in the middle are the speedo and tachometer, while the ovals on either side handle the rest. Theres a microcontroller on the front of the firewall that acts a bit like a modern engine control unit (ECU)  at least for the gauges; it sounds like the Volvos engine is stock, and that means carbureted for a car of that vintage.\nThe idea that this hack could have been done back in the 50s when the car was new just tickles us pink. Though youd have probably needed enough valves to fill up the boot, as our British friends would say. Translate that to enough vacuum tubes to fill the trunk if youre in one of the rebellious colonies.\nWeve featured [David]s projects previously, in the form of his wearable video coat. But his best known work is arguably the Nixie Watch, famously the timepiece of choice for Steve Wozniak.\nThanks to [JohnU] for the tip!\n\nAll images by Griffin Riley via The Autopian"}

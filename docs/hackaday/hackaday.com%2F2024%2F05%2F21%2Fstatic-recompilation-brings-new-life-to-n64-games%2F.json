This allows for these games to not only run natively on PCs, but also for improvements to be made to the rendering engine and other components.\nYet this artisan approach to porting these games means a massive time investment, something which static binary translation (static recompilation) may conceivably speed up. Enter the N64: Recompiled project, which provides a binary translation tool to ease the translation of the N64s binaries into C code.\nThis is effectively quite similar to what an emulator does in real-time, just with the goal of creating a permanent copy of the translated instructions. After this static binary translation, the C code can be compiled again, but as noted by the projects documentation, a suitable runtime is needed to get a functional game. An example of this is the Zelda 64: Recompiled project, which uses the N64: Recompiled project at its core, while providing the necessary scaffolding and wrappers to create a working copy of The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask as output.\nIn the video below, [Modern Vintage Gamer] takes the software for a test drive and comes away very excited about the potential it has to completely change the state of N64 emulation. To be clear, this isnt a one-button-press solution  it still requires capable developers to roll up their sleeves and get the plumbing in. Its going to take some time before you favorite game is supported, but the idea of breathing new life into some of the best games from the 1990s and early 2000s certainly has us eager to see where this technology goes\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip.", "title": "Nintendo 64\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092C\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u4efb\u5929\u580264\uff08N64\uff09\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u304cC\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002N64: Recompiled\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u7ffb\u8a33\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u7ffb\u8a33\u3092\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002\u30bc\u30eb\u30c064: Recompiled\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u300e\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u30e0\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u306e\u4eee\u9762\u300f\u3092C\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3002N64\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5909\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Nintendo 64\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092C\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "N64: Recompiled\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u76ee\u6a19", "N64\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30bc\u30eb\u30c064: Recompiled\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u6027", "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u3092\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u547d\u3092\u5439\u304d\u8fbc\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

Building a multi-ton guided missile that can handle the chaotic environment of rush-hour traffic without killing someone is a challenge, to say the least. So if youre looking to get into the autonomous car game, perhaps its best to start small.\nIf [Austin Blake]s fun-sized Tesla go-kart looks familiar, its probably because we covered the Teskart back when he whipped up this little demon of an EV from a Radio Flyer toy. Adding self-driving to the kart is a natural next step, so [Austin] set off on a journey into machine learning to make it happen. Having settled on behavioral cloning, which trains a model to replicate a behavior by showing it examples of the behavior, he built a bolt-on frame to hold a steering servo made from an electric wheelchair motor, some drive electronics, and a webcam attached to a laptop. Ten or so human-piloted laps around a walking path at a park resulted in a 48,000-image training set, along with the steering wheel angle at each point.\nThe first go-around wasnt so great, with the Teskart seemingly bent on going off the track. [Austin] retooled by adding two more webcams, to get a little parallax data and hopefully improve the training data. After a bug fix, the improved model really seemed to do the trick, with the Teskart pretty much keeping in its lane around the track, no matter how fast [Austin] pushed it. Check out the video below to see the Teskart in action.\nIts important to note that this isnt even close to Full Self-Driving. The only thing being controlled is the steering angle; [Austin] is controlling the throttle himself and generally acting as the safety driver should the car veer off course, which it tends to do at one particular junction. But its a great first step, and were looking forward to further development.\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u304b\u3089\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01", "body": "\u624b\u306e\u7a7a\u304b\u306a\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u4eba\u3092\u50b7\u3064\u3051\u305a\u306b\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u6df7\u96d1\u3059\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u904b\u8ee2\u3067\u304d\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002\n\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3082\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u307f\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u904b\u8ee2\u624b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\n\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3082\u304b\u304b\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u6210\u679c\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u767a\u5c55\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u304b\u3089\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01", "\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30e9\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01", "\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u4e0a\u3092\u5b89\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u8d70\u884c\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01", "\u81ea\u8d70\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u306e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b69\uff01"]}

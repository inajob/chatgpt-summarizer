However, if you desire fancier equipment, you might like the interactive hopscotch setup from [epatell].\nThe build uses yoga mats as the raw material to create each individual square of the hopscotch board. The squares all feature simple break-beam light sensors that detect when a foot lands in the given space. These sensors are monitored by a Raspberry Pi Pico in each square. In turn, the Pico lights up addressable NeoPixel LED strips in response to the current position of the player.\nIts a simple little project which makes a classic game just a little more fun. Its also a great learning project if youre trying to get to grips with things like microcontrollers and addressable LEDs in an educational context. Wed love to see the project taken a step further, perhaps with wirelessly-networked squares that can communicate and track the overall game state, or enable more advanced forms of play.\nMeanwhile, if youre working on updating traditional playground games with new technology, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

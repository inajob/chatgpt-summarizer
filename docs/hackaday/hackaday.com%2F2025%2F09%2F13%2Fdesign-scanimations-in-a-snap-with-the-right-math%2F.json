Move a set of opaque strips over a pattern, and watch as different slices of that image are alternately hidden and revealed, resulting in a simple animation. The tricky part is designing the whole thing  but researchers at MIT designed FabObscura as a design tool capable not only of creating the patterned sheets, but doing so in a way that allows for complex designs.\nThe barrier grid need not consist of simple straight lines, and movement of the grid can just as easily be a rotation instead of a slide. The system simply takes in the desired frames, a mathematical function describing how the display should behave, and creates the necessary design automatically.\nThe paper (PDF) has more details, and while it is possible to make highly complex animations with this system, the more frames and the more complex the design, the more prominent the barrier grid and therefore the harder it is to see whats going on. Still, there are some very nice results, such as the example in the image up top, which shows a coaster that can represent three different drink orders.\nWe recommend checking out the video (embedded below) which shows off other possibilities like a clock that looks like a hamster wheel, complete with running rodent. Its reminiscent of this incredibly clever clock that uses a Moir\u00e9 pattern (a kind of interference pattern between two elements) to reveal numerals as time passes.\nWe couldnt find any online demo or repository for FabObscura, but if you know of one, please share it in the comments.\n\n"}

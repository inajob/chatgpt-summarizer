This is due to, typically, an inability to run traces beyond your board  and most panel generators dont give you the option, either. However, if you go for hand-crafted panels or modify a KiKit-created panel, you can easily add extra elements  for instance, why not add vias in the V-Cut path to preserve electrical connectivity between your boards?\n[Adam Gulyas] went out and tried just that, and its a wonderfully viable method. He shows us how to calculate the via size to be just right given V-Cut and drilling tolerances, and then demonstrates design of an example board with discrete component LED blinkers you can power off a coin cell. The panel gets sent off to be manufactured and assembled, but dont break the boards apart just yet  connect power to the two through-hole testpoints on the frame, and watch your panel light up all at once.\nIts a flashy demonstration  even more so once you put light-diffusing spheres on top of the domes. You could always do such a trick with mousebites, but you risk having the tracks tear off the board, and, V-Cuts are no doubt the cleanest way to panelize  no edge cleaning is required after breaking the boards apart.

This led to quite a few of these Nebra LoRa Miners getting sold off, with the [Buy it Fix it] channel being one of those who sought to give these chunks of IP-67-rated computing hardware a new life.\nOriginally designed to be part of the Helium Network Token (HNT) cryptocurrency mining operation, with users getting rewarded by having these devices operating, they contain fairly off-the-shelf hardware. As can be glanced from e.g. the Sparkfun product page, its basically a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+ on a breakout board with a RAK 2287 LoRa module.\u00a0The idea in the video was to convert it into a Meshcore repeater, which ought to be fairly straightforward, one might think.\nUnfortunately the unit came with a dead eMMC chip on the compute module, the LoRa module wasnt compatible with Meshcore, and the Nebra breakout board only covers the first 24 pins of the standard RPi header on its pin header.\n\nThe solutions involved using a \u00b5SD card for the firmware instead of the eMMC, and doing some creative routing on the bottom of the breakout board to connect the unconnected pins on the breakouts RPi header to the pins on the compute modules connector. This way a compatible LoRa module could be placed on this header.\nRather than buying an off-the-shelf LoRa module for the RPi and waiting for delivery, a custom module was assembled from an eByte E22 LoRa module and some stripboard to test whether the contraption would work at all. Fortunately a test of the system as a Meshcore repeater showed that it works as intended, serving as a pretty decent proof-of-concept of how to repurpose those systems from a defunct crypto mining scheme into a typical LoRa repeater, whether Meshcore or equivalent.\n", "title": "\u300cLoRa\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\uff1aMeshcore\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u6539\u9020\u300d", "body": "Helium\u306eLoRa\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u3092Meshcore\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cLoRa\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\uff1aMeshcore\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u6539\u9020\u300d", "\u300cHelium\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3001\u518d\u751f\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "\u300ceMMC\u6545\u969c\u306e\u514b\u670d\uff1aNebra LoRa Miners\u306e\u6539\u9020\u8a18\u300d", "\u300c\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0LoRa\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "\u300c\u4e0d\u826f\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306eLoRa\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u300d"]}

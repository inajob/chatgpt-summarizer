For [Ruth Amos], a $78,000 LED bed had caught her eye, and she wondered if she could recreate the same functionality on the cheap.\nThe concept behind [Ruth]s build is simple enough. Rather than buy a crazy-expensive off-the-shelf beauty product, she decided to just buy equivalent functional components: a bunch of cheap red LEDs. Then, all she had to do was build these into a facemask and loungewear set to get the same supposed skin improving benefits at much lower cost.\n[Ruth] started her build with a welding mask, inside which she fitted red LED strips of the correct wavelength for beneficial skin effects. She then did the same with an over-sized tracksuit, lacing it with an array of LED strips to cover as much of the body as possible. While its unlikely she was able to achieve the same sort of total body coverage as a full-body red light bed, nor was it particularly comfortable\u2014her design cost a lot less\u2014on the order of $100 or so.\nOf course, you might question the light therapy itself. Were not qualified to say whether or not red LEDs will give you better skin, but its not the first time weve seen a DIY attempt at light therapy.\n"}

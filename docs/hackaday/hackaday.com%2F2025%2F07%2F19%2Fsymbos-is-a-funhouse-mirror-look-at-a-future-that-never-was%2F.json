Case in point is SymbOS, a multitasking OS for Z80 machines by Amstrad, Sinclair, and the MSX2 family of computers that updated to version 4.0 earlier this year.\nThe best way to describe SymbOS is like looking at an alternate reality where Microsoft created Windows 95 ten years early to put on the MSX instead of the BASIC they were paid to provide. SymbOS 4.0 comes even further into alignment with that design language, with a new file explorer that looks a lot like Windows Explorer replacing (or supplementing) the earlier Midnight Commander style utility in version 3.\nThanks to the preemptive multitasking, you can listen to tracker music while organizing files and writing documents, and even play a port of DOOM. Chat with your friends on IRC while watching (low res) videos on SymboVid. If youre looking for productivity, all the old business software written for CP/M can run in a virtual machine. Theres even an IDE if you can stand the compile times on what is, we have to remember, an 8-bit, 1980s machine. Its hard to remember that while watching the demo video embedded below.\nThe operating system supports up to 1024kb of RAM (in 64kb chunks, of course) and file systems up to 2 TB, which is an absolutely bonkers amount of space for this eras machines.\u00a0 One enterprising dev has even got his CPC talking to ChatGPT, if thats your jam. You can try SymbOS for free online on an MSX emulator, or toss it onto a spare Raspberry Pi.\u00a0 If youre feeling adventurous, theres a port in the works for the Isetta TLL retrocomputer.\nThis isnt the first modern OS weve featured for the Z80,\u00a0the processor which will live forever in our hearts and tapeouts.\nThanks to [Manuel] for the tip.\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aZ80\u5411\u3051OS\u300cSymbOS\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f34.0\u767b\u5834", "body": "Z80\u7528\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30bf\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0OS\u300cSymbOS\u300d\u304c\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u30021980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aZ80\u5411\u3051OS\u300cSymbOS\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f34.0\u767b\u5834", "- SymbOS 4.0\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- Z80\u3068\u5171\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bSymbOS\u306e\u591a\u5f69\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd", "- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u904a\u3076\uff01SymbOS\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "- Raspberry Pi\u3084\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u8a66\u305b\u308bSymbOS\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

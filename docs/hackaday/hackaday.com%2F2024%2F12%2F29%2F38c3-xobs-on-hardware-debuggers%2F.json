But if you want to make a hardware debugger yourself, you need to understand the various target chips debugging protocols, and then youre deep in the weeds. But never fear, Sean [Xobs] Cross has been working on a hardware debugger and is here to share his learnings about the ARM, RISC-V, and JTAG debugging protocols with us.\nHe starts off with a list of everything you need the debugger hardware to be able to do: peek and poke memory, read and write to the CPU registers, and control the CPUs execution state. With that simple list of goals, he then goes through how to do it for each of the target chip families. We especially liked [Xobs]s treatment of the JTAG state machine, which looks pretty complicated on paper, but in the end, you only need to get it in and out of the shift-dr and shift-ir states.\n\nThis is a deep talk for sure, but if youre ever in the throes of building a microcontroller programmer or debugger, it provides a much-appreciated roadmap to doing so.\nAnd once youve got your hardware setup, maybe its time to dig into GDB? Weve got you covered.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002ARM\u3084RISC-V\u3001JTAG\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u7d30\u306b\u8aac\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "ARM\u3001RISC-V\u3001JTAG\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u7406\u89e3", "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "JTAG\u72b6\u614b\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "GDB\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306e\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1"]}

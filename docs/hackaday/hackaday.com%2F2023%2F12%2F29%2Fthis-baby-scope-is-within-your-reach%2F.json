They dont cost much, and having one on your bench gives you an edge unavailable in a previous time. Thats not to dismiss older CRT scopes though, the glow of a phosphor trace has illuminated many a fault finding procedure. These older instruments can even be pretty simple, as [Mircemk] demonstrates with a small home-made example that we have to admit to rather liking.\nAt its heart is a small 5 cm round CRT tube, with an off-the-shelf buck converter supplying the HT, a neon lamp relaxation oscillator supplying the timebase, and a set of passive components conditioning the signal to the deflection plates. The whole thing runs from 12 V and fits in a neat case. It has one huge flaw in that there is no trigger circuit, and sadly this compromises its usefulness as an instrument. Our understanding of a neon oscillator is a little rusty but were guessing the two-terminal neon lamp would have to be replaced by one of the more exotic gas-filled tubes with more electrodes, of which one takes the trigger pulse.\nEven without a trigger its still a neat device, so take a look at it. Perhaps surprisingly weve seen few CRT scopes made from scratch here at Hackaday, but never fear, heres one used as an audio visualiser.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5c0f\u578bCRT\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "body": "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3001\u96fb\u5727\u8a08\u3001\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u53e4\u3044CRT\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3082\u4f9d\u7136\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6709\u7528\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u304c\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306e5cm\u306eCRT\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u56de\u8def\u304c\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5236\u9650\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5c0f\u578bCRT\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046", "DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3066", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u306b\u7f6e\u304f\u3079\u304d\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3068\u306f", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306aCRT\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

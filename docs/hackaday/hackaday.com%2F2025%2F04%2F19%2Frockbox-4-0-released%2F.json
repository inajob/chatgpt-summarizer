But, in this case, the venerable MP3 firmware actually did update after a long absence.\u00a0Its great to see that good old Rockbox is still kicking along. We first mentioned Rockbox here at Hackaday approaching 20 years ago. How time flies. There used to be a whole scene around hacking Personal Media Players (PMPs), also known as MP3 Players. \nWe tracked down Rockbox contributor [Solomon Peachy] to ask for some simple advice: If someone wants to install Rockbox on a personal media player today, what hardware should they buy? [Solomon] referred us to the AIGO EROS Q / EROS K, which is the only compatible hardware still being manufactured and sold. Beyond that, if you want to buy compatible hardware, youll need to find some secondhand somewhere, such as eBay. See the Rockbox Wiki for supported hardware.\nSmartphones and streaming services have subsumed the single-purpose personal media player. Will you put the new Rockbox on something? Let us know in the comments.\n"}

Next time you are in a room with someone, ask them to name everything in the room. Only certain kinds of people will say air or light. For most people, those are just givens, and you dont think about them unless, for some reason, you dont have them. Resistance is like that in electronics. You use it constantly, but do you ever think much about what it is? For a resistor, the value in ohms really represents the slope of the line that describes the amount of voltage youll see across the component when it carries a certain amount of current. For resistors, that slope is  at least in theory  constant and positive. But [Void Electronics] made a video exploring negative resistance, and it is worth watching, below.\nIf you havent seen negative resistance before, you might wonder how that is possible. Ohms law is just a shorthand for calculating the slope of a graph with voltage on the Y axis and current on the X axis. It works because the voltage and current are always zero at the same time, so the slope is (V-0)/(I-0), and we just shorten that to the normal Ohms law equation.\nBut not everything has a linear response to current. Some devices will have different slopes over different current regions. And sometimes that slope can be negative, meaning that an increase in current through the device will cause it to drop less voltage. Of course, this is usually just over a narrow range and, as [Void] points out, most devices dont specify that parameter on their data sheets. In fact, some transistors wont even work in the circuit.\nThe circuit in question in the video below the break is an odd one. It uses two resistors, an LED, and a transistor. But the transistors base is left disconnected. No 555 needed. How does it work? Watch the video and youll see. Theres even a curve tracer if you dont like to see hand-drawn graphs.\nWeve looked at negative resistance more than once. There are a few exotic devices, like tunnel diodes, that are explicitly used for the negative resistance property. When the gas in a neon bulb breaks down, you get the same effect.\n"}

Unlike some indicators, the F-4s can rotate to show pitch, roll, and yaw, so it moves in three different directions. [Ken] wondered how that could work, so, like any of us, he took it apart to find out.\nWith the cover off, the device is a marvel of compact design. Then you realize that some of the circuit is inside the ball, so theres even more than it appears at a quick glance. As you might have guessed, there are two separate slip rings that allow the ball to turn freely without tangling wires. Of course, even if you dont tangle wires, getting the ball to reflect the aircrafts orientation is an exercise in control theory, and [Ken] shows us the servo loop that makes it happen. Theres a gyroscope and synchros\u2014sometimes known by the trade name selsyn\u2014to keep everything in the same position.\nYou have to be amazed by the designers of things like this. Sophisticated both electrically and mechanically, rugged, compact, and able to handle a lot of stress. Good thing it didnt have to be cheap.\nWeve seen inside an ADI before. If you want to make any of this look simple, check out the mechanical flight computers from the 1950s.\n\n", "title": "F-4\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u5de5\u5730\u5e73\u7dda\u8a08\u5668\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b", "body": "F-4\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u5165\u624b\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u304c\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5730\u5e73\u7dda\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3001\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u56de\u8def\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u5185\u306b\u3042\u308b\u30b9\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u56de\u8ee2\u3002\u5236\u5fa1\u7406\u8ad6\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u59ff\u52e2\u3092\u53cd\u6620\u3002\u6280\u8853\u306f\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["F-4\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u5de5\u5730\u5e73\u7dda\u8a08\u5668\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b", "F-4\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f\u306e\u8a08\u5668\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u5236\u5fa1\u7406\u8ad6\u3092\u5fdc\u7528", "\u4eba\u5de5\u5730\u5e73\u7dda\u8a08\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\uff1a\u56de\u8ee2\u81ea\u5728\u306a\u7403\u90e8\u306b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc", "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\uff1aF-4\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f\u306e\u8a08\u5668\u306e\u4e2d\u8eab", "1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u822a\u7a7a\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3092\u901a\u3057\u3066\u898b\u308b\uff1a\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u5730\u5e73\u7dda\u8a08\u5668"]}

But when you need to get a certain reduction in a very small space with minimal to no backlash, you might find a wave drive very useful. [Mishin Machine] shows us how to build one with (mostly) 3D printed components.\nThe video does a great job of explaining the basics of the design. Right off the bat, well say this one isnt fully printed\u2014it relies on off-the-shelf steel ball bearings. Its easy to understand why. When you need strong, smooth-rolling parts, its hard to print competitive spheres in plastic at home. Plastic BBs will work too, though, as will various off-the-shelf cylindrical rollers. The rest is mostly 3D printed, so with the right design, you can whip up a wave drive to suit whatever packaging requirements you might have.\nCombined with a stepper motor and the right off-the-shelf parts, you can build a high-reduction gearbox that can withstand high torque and should have reasonable longevity despite being assembled with many\u00a0 printed components.\nWeve seen other interesting gear reductions before, too.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u6ce2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u6ce2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u306b\u3082\u8010\u3048\u308b\u30ae\u30a2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u304c\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u6ce2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u308b\u6ce2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u30ae\u30a2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ae\u30a2\u6e1b\u901f\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u9ad8\u52b9\u7387\u30ae\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

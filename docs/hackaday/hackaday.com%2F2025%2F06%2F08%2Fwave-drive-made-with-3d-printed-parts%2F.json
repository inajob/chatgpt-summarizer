But when you need to get a certain reduction in a very small space with minimal to no backlash, you might find a wave drive very useful. [Mishin Machine] shows us how to build one with (mostly) 3D printed components.\nThe video does a great job of explaining the basics of the design. Right off the bat, well say this one isnt fully printed\u2014it relies on off-the-shelf steel ball bearings. Its easy to understand why. When you need strong, smooth-rolling parts, its hard to print competitive spheres in plastic at home. Plastic BBs will work too, though, as will various off-the-shelf cylindrical rollers. The rest is mostly 3D printed, so with the right design, you can whip up a wave drive to suit whatever packaging requirements you might have.\nCombined with a stepper motor and the right off-the-shelf parts, you can build a high-reduction gearbox that can withstand high torque and should have reasonable longevity despite being assembled with many\u00a0 printed components.\nWeve seen other interesting gear reductions before, too.\n\n"}

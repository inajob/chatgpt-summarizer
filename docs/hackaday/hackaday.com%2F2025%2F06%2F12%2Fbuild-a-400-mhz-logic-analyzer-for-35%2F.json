As [nanofix] shows in a recent video, you find one thats available as an open hardware project and build it yourself.\nThe project, aptly named LogicAnalyzer was developed by [Dr. Gusman] a few years back, and has actually graced these pages in the past. In the video below,\u00a0[nanofix] concentrates on the mechanics of actually putting the board together with a focus on soldering. The back of the build is the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and the TXU0104 level shifters.\nIf youd like to follow along at home, all the build instructions and design files are\u00a0 available on GitHub. For your convenience the Gerber files have been shared at PCBWay\nOf course we have heaps of material here at Hackaday covering logic analyzers. If youre interested in budget options check out $13 Scope And Logic Analyzer Hits 18 Msps or how to build one using a ZX Spectrum!

Its filmed using an array of cameras in an arc, something which was pretty expensive back then but is now within the reach of almost anyone. Just how cheaply bullet time can be filmed is shown by [3DSage], who turned nine toy cameras into a budget bullet time rig.\nThe cameras themselves are what you might expect for the princely sum of nine dollars, but as he points out, their low-resolution video has a certain charm. Some iteration was required to produce the rig without fouling their flip-out screens, and he found that the video quality was far better than their still image quality. But eventually he was able to extract the required array of frames and stitch them together with a video interpolator for the required effect. His cat is a handsome creature from any angle, we can now reveal.\nThe video below the break has all the details, and while we couldnt spot quite the same camera he used on our local version of the online shop he used, there seem to be plenty of similar cheap devices should you wish to try it for yourself. Either way, this cost much less than the previous budget bullet time contender.\n\n", "title": "1999\u5e74\u306e\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d\u304c\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u300cBullet time\u300d\u30929\u53f0\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "body": "1999\u5e74\u306b\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u304c\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u3067\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u624b\u306e\u5c4a\u304f\u7bc4\u56f2\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u30029\u3064\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f[3DSage]\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u3002", "titles": ["1999\u5e74\u306e\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d\u304c\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u300cBullet time\u300d\u30929\u53f0\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "9\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u73a9\u5177\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u300cBullet time\u300d\u64ae\u5f71\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u53ef\u80fd\u306aBullet time\u64ae\u5f71\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fBullet time\u6620\u50cf\u5236\u4f5c", "\u304a\u624b\u9803\u4fa1\u683c\u3067Bullet time\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

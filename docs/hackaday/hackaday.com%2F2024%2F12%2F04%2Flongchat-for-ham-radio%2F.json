A new program, LongChat, is a new entry into the ham radio software world that could bring chatting back to ham radio. [Tech Minds] has a video covering it (and using it), which you can see below.\nWhile some people do talk using microphones or Morse code keys, there are a lot of digital modes now. Some, like RTTY or PSK31, can support conversations, but the more popular ones, like FT-8, are very stripped down. Your computer exchanges basic information with the other stations computer, and thats it.\n\nThe LongChat program is very new, and we were sad to see it is only for Windows so far. It also isnt open source, so we arent sure if other platforms will get any love.\nLike other modern modes, it uses forward error correction and can operate in as little as 300 Hz of bandwidth. Subtracting overhead, you can expect to send 40 bits per second which is about five characters per second. This isnt for file transfer, but for leisurely chats.\nThe software is from\u00a0 [Oguz] (TA2STO), a ham from T\u00fcrkiye. His video about the software is the second video below. The original intent was to allow sensors to send data long distances on very low power.\nOf course, new modes like this are only useful if people start using them and can find each other. For now, youd probably have to do like [Tech Minds] and try it out with a friend.\nIf youd rather get started with FT8 first, we can help you out. For better or worse, ham radio and computers are inextricably married.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u98a8\u3092\uff01LongChat\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u300cLongChat\u300d\u306f\u3001\u4f1a\u8a71\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002\u73fe\u72b6\u306fWindows\u5c02\u7528\u3067\u3001\u4ef2\u9593\u3068\u8a66\u3059\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u98a8\u3092\uff01LongChat\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aLongChat\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u4f1a\u8a71\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- Windows\u5c02\u7528\uff01LongChat\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- 40\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8/\u79d2\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- FT8\u304b\u3089LongChat\u3078\uff1a\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

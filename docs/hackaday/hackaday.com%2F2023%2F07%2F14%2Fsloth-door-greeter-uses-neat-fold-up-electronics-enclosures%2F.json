Sloxel, as he is affectionately known, can move around and even talk, with [Alan] using some nifty tricks in the design process\nSloxels job is to vet visitors to [Alans] house, before inviting them to knock on the door or to leave their details and go away. Theres still plenty of work to do on that functionality, which [Alan] plans to implement using ChatGPT. In the meantime, though, hes been working hard on the hardware platform that will power Sloxel. A Raspberry Pi 3B+ is charged with running the show, including talking to the ChatGPT API and handling Sloxels motion along a linear rail with a number of stepper motors.\nWhat we really love about this build, though, is the enclosure. [Alan] designed a housing for everything that can be 3D printed as a single part with print-in-place hinges. The four sides of the enclosure can then be folded up and into place with a minimum of fuss. Plus, the enclosure has plenty of nifty features that makes it easy to mount all the required hardware. Its a neat design that wed love to repurpose for some of our own projects.\nWeve seen other neat ideas in this area before, like using PCBs themselves as an enclosure. Video after the break.\n\n"}

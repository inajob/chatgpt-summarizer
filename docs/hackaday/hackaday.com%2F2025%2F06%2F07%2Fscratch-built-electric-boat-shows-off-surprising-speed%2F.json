Looking to go green on the water, [NASAT] put together this impressively nimble boat propelled by a pair of brushless motors.\nThe boat itself has a completely custom-built hull, using plywood as a mold for the ultimate fiberglass body. Its a catamaran-like shape that seems to allow it to get on plane fairly easily, increasing its ultimate speed compared to a displacement hull. It gets up to that speed with two electric motors totaling 4 kW, mated to a belt-driven drivetrain spinning a fairly standard prop. Power is provided by a large battery, and the solar panel at the top can provide not only shade for the operator, but 300 W to charge the battery when the motors are not being used.\nWith the finishing touches put on, the small single-seat boat effortlessly powers around the water with many of the same benefits of an electric car: low noise, low pollution, a quiet ride, and a surprisingly quick feel. Electrification has come for other boats as well, like this sailing catamaran converted to electric-only. Even some commercial boats have begun to take the plunge.\n\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9769\u547d\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u822a\u6d77\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "body": "NASAT\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u52d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u9a12\u97f3\u3067\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u52d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9769\u547d\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u822a\u6d77\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "- \u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u6c34\u4e0a\u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5207\u308a\u958b\u304f", "- \u9759\u97f3\u3068\u4f4e\u6392\u51fa\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u52d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u9032\u3080\u8266\u8239\uff1a\u96fb\u6c17\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u8239\u8236"]}

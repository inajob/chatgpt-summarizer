While there are plenty of commercial solutions out there, [Caelestis Cosplay] has created a simple document scanner that takes documents, as [Caelestis Cosplay] puts it, from papers to pixels.\nThe build is probably what youre expecting  its essentially a Raspberry Pi (in this case a 4B), a V2 Pi camera, and a handful of custom 3D-printed parts. [Caelestis Cosplay] says they had never designed anything for printing before, and we think it looks great. Theres also a buzzer to indicate that the scan is starting (one beep) or has completed (two beeps), a ready indicator, and a working indicator.\nEverything youd need to build your own is available over on Instructables, including document scanner and controller scripts. Be sure to check it out in action after the break, and see it quickly scan in a document and put it on a thumb drive.\nLooking for a 3D scanner? Check out the OpenScan project.\n\n"}

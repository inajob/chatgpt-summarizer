While this has become easier in recent years, scientists have found\u00a0some promising results in mice for disabling the disease. [via ScienceAlert]\nSince celiac is an auto-immune disorder, finding ways to alter the immune response to gluten is one area of investigation to alleviate the symptoms of the disease. Using a so-called inverse vaccine, researchers engineered regulatory T cells (eTregs) modified to orthotopically express T cell receptors specific to gluten peptides could quiet gluten-reactive effector T cells.\nThe reason these are called inverse vaccines is that, unlike a traditional vaccine that turns up the immune response to a given stimuli, this does the opposite. When the scientists tried the technique with transgenic mice, the mice exhibited resistance to the typical effects of the target gluten antigen and a related type on the digestive system. As with much research, there is still a lot of work to do, including testing resistance to other types of gluten and whether there are still long-term deleterious effects on true celiac digestive systems as the transgenic mice only had HLA-DQ2.5 reactivity.\nIf this sounds vaguely familiar, we covered inverse vaccines in more detail previously.", "title": "- \u30bb\u30ea\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u9006\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30bb\u30ea\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u75c5\u306b\u306f\u6cbb\u7642\u6cd5\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30b0\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u9006\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u3067\u514d\u75ab\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bb\u30ea\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u9006\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "- \u30b0\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u514d\u75ab\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u6291\u5236\u3059\u308bT\u7d30\u80de\u306e\u751f\u6210\u306b\u6210\u529f", "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30b8\u30a7\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30bb\u30ea\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u9032\u5c55", "- \u9006\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u304c\u793a\u3059\u514d\u75ab\u5fdc\u7b54\u306e\u6291\u5236\u52b9\u679c", "- \u30bb\u30ea\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u75c5\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b0\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u8010\u6027\u7372\u5f97\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u72b6\u6cc1"]}

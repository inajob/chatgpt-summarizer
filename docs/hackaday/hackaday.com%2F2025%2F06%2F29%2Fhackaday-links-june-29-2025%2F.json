Gone are the days when an overworked human in a snappy windbreaker would give your rental return a once-over with the old Mark Ones to make sure you hadnt messed the car up too badly. Instead, Hertz is fielding up to 100 of these MRI scanners for cars. The damage discovery tool uses cameras to capture images of the car and compares them to a model thats apparently been trained on nothing but showroom cars. Redditors whove had the displeasure of being subjected to this thing report being charged egregiously high damage fees for non-existent damage. To add insult to injury, if renters want to appeal those charges, they have to argue with a chatbot first, one that offers no path to speaking with a human. While this is likely to be quite a tidy profit center for Hertz, their customers still have a vote here, and backlash will likely lead the company to adjust the model to be a bit more lenient, if not outright scrapping the system.\n\nHave you ever picked up a flashlight and tried to shine it through your hand? You probably have; its just a thing you do, like the double tap every time you pick up a power drill. Weve yet to find a flashlight bright enough to sufficiently outline the bones in our palm, although weve had some luck looking through the flesh of our fingers. While thats pretty cool, its quite a bit different from shining a light directly through a human head, which was recently accomplished for the first time at the University of Glasgow. The researchers blasted a powerful pulsed laser against the skull of a volunteer with fair skin and no hair and managed to pick up a few photons on the other side, despite an attenuation factor of about 1018. We havent read the paper yet, so its unclear if the researchers controlled for the possibility of the flesh on the volunteers skull acting like a light pipe and conducting the light around the skull rather than through it, but if the laser did indeed penetrate the skull and everything within it, its pretty cool. Why would you do this, especially when we already have powerful light sources that can easily penetrate the skull and create exquisitely detailed images of the internal structures? Why the hell wouldnt you?!\nTIG welding aluminum is a tough process to master, and just getting to the point where youve got a weld youre not too embarrassed of would be so much easier if you could just watch someone who knows what theyre doing. Thats a tall order, though, as the work area is literally a tiny pool of molten metal no more than a centimeter in diameter thats bathed in an ultra-bright arc thats throwing off cornea-destroying UV light. Luckily, Aaron over at 6061.com on YouTube has a fantastic new video featuring up-close and personal shots of him welding up some aluminum coupons. He captured them with a Helios high-speed welding camera, and the detail is fantastic. You can watch the weld pool forming and see the cleaning action of the AC waveform clearly. The shots make it clear exactly where and when you should dip your filler rod into the pool, the effect of moving the torch smoothly and evenly, and how contaminants can find their way into your welds. The shots make it clear what a dynamic environment the weld pool is, and why its so hard to control.\n\nAnd finally, the title may be provocative, but The Sensual Wrench is a must-see video for anyone even remotely interested in tools. Its from the New Mind channel on YouTube, and it covers the complete history of wrenches. Our biggest surprise was learning how relatively recent an invention the wrench is; it didnt really make an appearance in anything like its modern form until the 1800s. The video covers everything from the first adjustable wrenches, including the classic monkey and Crescent patterns, through socket wrenches with all their various elaborations, right through to impact wrenches. Check it out and get you ugga-dugga on.\n"}

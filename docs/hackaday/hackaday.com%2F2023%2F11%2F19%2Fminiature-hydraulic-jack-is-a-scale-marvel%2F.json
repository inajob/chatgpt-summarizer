But heres the kicker: Its a real hydraulic jack with real hydraulic fluid! At 1/5th scale, it obviously isnt as strong as a full-size jack, but it can still easily lift an impressive 24 soda cans! Switching between the lathe and mill, [Maker B] shows how all the parts of the jack are made from stock metal in detail, and even explains in simple terms how a hydraulic jack works in this masterpiece of a video.\nOver the years, weve seen plenty of tiny objects cranked out from stock pieces of metal  often bolts. But the fact that the end result here is a working tool, puts it into a decidedly less common niche. Of course, given what weve seen from [Maker B] in the past, its hardly a surprise.\n\n"}

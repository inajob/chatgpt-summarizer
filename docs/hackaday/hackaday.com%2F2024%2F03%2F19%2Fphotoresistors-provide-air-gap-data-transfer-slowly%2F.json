This can often include other peripherals like USB drives and other removable storage as well, so getting information to and from secure (or compromised) systems behind air gaps can often present a challenge. But assuming you have local access to the computer and your parts bin handy, these optical solutions from [Nikolay] can allow\u00a0 data transfer to or from\u00a0such off-line computers.\n[Nikolay]s specific use case for this project is to transfer small amounts of information to or from computers that may be compromised in some way, or computers that might otherwise be dangerous to connect to other equipment. Theres actually several methods described in the project, the first involves temporarily attaching a photoresistor to the computers screen which has been wired into the remains of a USB keyboard. A script running on the compromised machine translates data into a series of white and black squares. The sensors can detect these patterns much like playing Duck Hunt on an old CRT television and transmit the data across the air gap with reasonable certainty nothing harmful crossed with it.\n\n\nThe second is essentially a DIY optoisolator arrangement, where the audio output of the compromised computer is used to flash an LED by way of a simple transistor circuit. On the receiving side, a photoresistor connected to the audio input picks up the flashing LED as sound. The whole thing is enclosed in a black plastic box, and with the appropriate software, [Nikolay] says it can transfer 345 bytes per second between the two machines.\nWhile the methods detailed by [Nikolay] certainly arent fast, they could still be extremely useful in a number of cases. Hes also set up all of the code so that its ready to go as soon as the diodes and transistors are soldered together. A friendly reminder to all, though, that although its definitely a step in the right direction an air gap isnt an impenetrable wall of security.", "title": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u3001\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30a8\u30a2\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002[Nikolay]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3053\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8ee2\u9001\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff12\u3064\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u65b9\u6cd5", "USB\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306a\u3069\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\uff1a\u30a8\u30a2\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ea\u30be\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u9593\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u8ee2\u9001\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u3068LED\u306b\u3088\u308bDIY\u5149\u7d76\u7e01\u5668\uff1a\u60c5\u5831\u4f1d\u9054\u901f\u5ea6\u306f345\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8/\u79d2", "\u30a8\u30a2\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u4e00\u5f79\u8cb7\u3046\uff1a\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u3092\u884c\u3046"]}

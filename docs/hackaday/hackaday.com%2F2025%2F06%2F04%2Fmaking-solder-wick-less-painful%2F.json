Unfortunately, solder suckers and vacuum pumps lose most of their utility when you move from through-hole to SMD components, forcing us to use the dreaded wick. For those of us in this mindset, [nanofix]\u2019s recent video which weve placed below the break on tips for solder wick could make desoldering a much less annoying experience.Most of the tips have to do with maintaining proper control of heat flow and distribution. [nanofix]\u2019s first recommendation is to cut off short segments of wick, rather than using it straight from the roll, which reduces the amount of heat lost to conduction along the rest of the length. It\u2019s also important to maintain a certain amount of solder on the soldering iron\u2019s tip to improve conduction between the tip and the wick, and to periodically re-tin the tip to replace absorbed solder. Counterintuitively, [nanofix] explains that a low temperature on the soldering iron is more likely to damage the board than a high temperature, since solder wick getting stuck to a pad risks tearing the traces. [nanofix] also notes that most boards come from the factory with lead-free solder, which has a higher melting point than tin-lead solder, and thus makes it harder to wick. He recommends first adding eutectic lead-based solder to the pads, then wicking away the new, lower melting-point mixture. Other miscellaneous tips include cutting a more precise tip into pieces of wick, always using flux, avoiding small soldering iron tips, and preheating the board with hot air. We\u2019ve seen a couple of guides to desoldering before. If you\u2019re looking for more exotic methods for easing the task, you can always use bismuth.\n"}

But the real star of the show here is NiTinol, a shape metal alloy composed of nickel and titanium. It is increasingly available, with a lot of potential; maybe we should add it to our repertoire of materials for building.\nFirst the inspiration for the discussion; a project making airless tires for bikes and scooters using nitinol. The company has been on Shark Tank (unsuccessfully) pedaling their wares, but their Kickstarter project has already met their goal. We should soon see a real commercial application of this miracle metal, and not long after well see what happens when the rubber meets the road on these airless tires and their long-term performance. Its not accurate to say they dont use rubber; they just use LESS, because theyre still treaded, albeit with a layer that is adhered to the metal coil, and you dont need tubes, either. The tread will still wear down and needs to be replaced occasionally for the lifetime of the tire, but the real advantage is never having a flat tire again. Considering how inconvenient flats are, and the number of meetings Ive been late commuting to because of an unplanned rapid deflation, these tires might be worth it. If youre wondering why theyre so expensive, some napkin calculations of the nitinol coil have somewhere between 100 ft  200 ft of wire per wheel, and at $1-2/ft, the raw materials alone before assembly make it an expensive piece of kit.\nSo whats so cool about nitinol that its worth playing with, and what does it do that spring steel or stainless steel cant? Well, you can soak it in acid for a year and it will continue unaffected. It has great biocompatibility, so you can put it in someones arteries as a stent and it will go through tens of millions of cycles without cracking. Its 10 times better at recovery, and lighter, and its not magnetic, which can be useful. The memory capability is handy, too, because it means you can rapidly prototype springs, then heat and quench them to set their memory, and easily adjust them.\nAdmittedly, I dont have a use for it right now. But just like the coils of nichrome and piano wire waiting anxiously in my bins for their opportunity to shine, nitinol is screaming for a fun use.\n"}

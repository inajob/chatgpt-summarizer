New offices and apartments were built higher and higher as density increased and skylines grew ever upwards. One could live and work at height, but this created a simple inconvenience\u2014if you wanted to send any mail, you had to go all the way down to ground level.\nIn true American fashion, this minor inconvenience would not be allowed to stand. A simple invention would solve the problem, only to later fall out of vogue as technology and safety standards moved on. Today, we explore the rise and fall of the humble mail chute.\n\nGoing Down\nBorn in 1848 in Albany, New York, James Goold Cutler would come to build his life in the state. He lived and worked in the growing state, and as an architect, he soon came to identify an obvious problem. For those occupying higher floors in taller buildings, the simple act of sending a piece of mail could quickly become a tedious exercise. One would have to make their way all the way to a street level post box, which grew increasingly tiresome as buildings grew ever taller.\nCutlers original patent for the mail chute.

It then became as simple as dropping a letter in, and down it would go to a collection box at the bottom, where postal workers could retrieve it during their regular rounds. Cutler filed a patent for this simple design in 1883. He was sure to include a critical security feature\u2014a hand guard behind each floors mail chute. This was intended to stop those on lower levels reaching into the chute to steal the mail passing by from above. Installations in taller buildings were also to be fitted with an elastic cushion in the bottom to prevent injury to the mail from higher drop heights.\nA Cutler Receiving Box that was built in 1920.

The chute proved fit for purpose in the seven-story building, but there was a problem. The collection box at the bottom of Cutlers chute was seen by the postal authorities as a mailbox. Federal mail laws were taken quite seriously, then as now, and they stated that mailboxes could only be installed in public buildings such as hotels, railway stations, or government facilities. The Elwood was a private building, and thus postal carriers refused to service the collection box.\nIt consists of a chute running down through each story to a mail box on the ground floor, where the postman can come and take up the entire mail of the tenants of the building. A patent was easily secured, for nobody else had before thought of nailing four boards together and calling it a great thing.\nLetters could be dropped in the apertures on the fourth and fifth floors and they always fell down to the ground floor all right, but there they stated. The postman would not touch them. The trouble with the mail chute was the law which says that mail boxes shall be put only in Government and public buildings.\nThe Sun, New York, 20 Dec 1886\nCutlers brilliantly simple invention seemed dashed at the first hurdle. However, rationality soon prevailed. Postal laws were revised in 1893, and mail chutes were placed under the authority of the US Post Office Department. This had important security implications. Only post-office approved technicians would be allowed to clear mail clogs and repair and maintain the chutes, to ensure the safety and integrity of the mail.\nThe Cutler Mail chutes are easy to spot at the Empire State Building.

As skyscrapers became ever more popular at the dawn of the 20th century, so did the mail chute, with over 1,600 installed by 1905. The Cutler Manufacturing Company had been the sole manufacturer reaping the benefits of this boom up until 1904, when the US Post Office looked to permit competition in the market. However, Cutlers patent held fast, with his company merging with some rivals and suing others to dominate the market. The company also began selling around the world, with Londons famous Savoy Hotel installing a Cutler chute in 1904. By 1961, the company held 70 percent of the mail chute market, despite Cutlers passing and the expiry of the patent many years prior.\nThe value of the mail chute was obvious, but its success was not to last. Many companies began implementing dedicated mail rooms, which provided both delivery and pickup services across the floors of larger buildings. This required more manual handling, but avoided issues with clogs and lost mail and better suited bigger operations. As postal volumes increased, the chutes became seen as a liability more than a convenience when it came to important correspondence. Larger oversized envelopes proved a particular problem, with most chutes only designed to handle smaller envelopes. A particularly famous event in 1986 saw 40,000 pieces of mail stuck in a monster jam at the McGraw-Hill building, which took 23 mailbags to clear. It wasnt unusual for a piece of mail to get lost in a chute, only to turn up many decades later, undelivered.\nAn active mail chute in the Law Building in Akron, Ohio.

Come 1997, the National Fire Protection Association outright banned the installation of new mail chutes in new and existing buildings. The reasoning was simple. A mail chute was a single continuous cavity between many floors of a building, which could easily spread smoke and even flames, just like a chimney.\nDespite falling out of favor, however, some functional mail chutes do persist to this day. Real examples can still be spotted in places like the Empire State Building and New Yorks Grand Central station. Whether in use or deactivated, many still remain in older buildings as a visible piece of mail history.\nBetter building design standards and the unstoppable rise of email mean that the mail chute is ultimately a piece of history rather than a convenience of our modern age. Still, its neat to think that once upon a time, you could climb to the very highest floors of an office building and drop your important letters all the way to the bottom without having to use the elevator or stairs.\nCollage of mail chutes from Wikimedia Commons, Mark Turnauckas, and Britta Gustafson.", "title": "\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u767a\u660e\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "body": "\u90f5\u4fbf\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u30011848\u5e74\u306b\u767a\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u4eba\u6c17\u3092\u535a\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30011997\u5e74\u306b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u7406\u7531\u3067\u7981\u6b62\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u767a\u660e\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "\u9ad8\u5c64\u30d3\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316", "\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6804\u5149\u3068\u8870\u9000\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u6e96\u306e\u5909\u5316\u304c\u62db\u3044\u305f\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6d88\u6ec5", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u6b8b\u308b\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u540d\u6b8b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f79\u5272"]}

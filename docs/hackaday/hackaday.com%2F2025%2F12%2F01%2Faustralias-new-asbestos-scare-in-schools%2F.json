Its known for releasing fine, microscopic fibers that can lodge in the bodys tissues and cause deadly disease over a period of decades. Originally prized for its fire resistance and insulating properties, it was widely used in all sorts of building materials. Years after the dangers became clear, many countries eventually banned its use, with strict rules around disposal to protect the public from the risk it poses to health.\nAustralia is one of the stricter countries when it comes to asbestos, taking great pains to limit its use and its entry into the country. This made it all the more surprising when it became apparent that schools across the nation had been contaminated with loose asbestos material. The culprit was something altogether unexpected, too\u2014in the form of tiny little tubes of colored sand. Authorities have rushed to shut down schools as the media asked the obvious question\u2014how could this be allowed to happen?\n\nHiding In Plain Sight\nAustralia takes asbestos very seriously. Typically, asbestos disposal is supposed to occur according to very specific rules. Most state laws generally require that the material must be collected by qualified individuals except in minor cases, and that it must be bagged in multiple layers of plastic prior to disposal to avoid release of dangerous fibers into the environment. The use, sale, and import of asbestos has been outright banned since 2003, and border officials enforce strict checks on any imports deemed a high risk to potentially contain the material.\nColored sand is a popular artistic medium, used regularly by children in schools and households across Australia. Via: ProductSafety.gov.au\nThus, by and large, you would expect that any item you bought in an Australian retailer would be free of asbestos. That seemed to be true, until a recent chance discovery. A laboratory running tests on some new equipment happened to accidentally find asbestos contamination in a sample of colored sand\u2014a product typically marketed for artistic use by children. The manager of the lab happened to mention the finding in a podcast, with the matter eventually reaching New Zealand authorities who then raised the alarm with their Australian counterparts. This led to a investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which instituted a national safety recall in short order.\nThe response from there was swift. At least 450 schools instituted temporary shutdowns due to the presence or suspected presence of the offending material. Some began cleanup efforts in earnest, hiring professional asbestos removalists to deal with the colored sand. In many cases, the sand wasnt just in sealed packaging\u2014it had been used in countless student artworks or spilled in carpeted classrooms. Meanwhile, parents feared the worst after finding the offending products in their own homes. Cleanup efforts in many schools are ongoing, due in part to the massive spike in demand for the limited asbestos removal services available across the country. Authorities in various states have issued guidelines on how to handle cleanup and proper disposal of any such material found in the workplace.\nOver 87 retailers have been involved in a voluntary recall that has seen a wide range of colored sand products pulled from shelves.\nAt this stage, its unclear how asbestos came to contaminate colored sand products sold across the country, though links have been found to a quarry in China. Its believed that the products in question have been imported into Australia since 2020, but have never faced any testing regarding asbestos content. Different batches have tested positive for both tremolite and chrysotile asbestos, both of which present health risks to the public. However, authorities have thus far stated the health risks of the colored sand are low.\u00a0The danger from asbestos comes when there are very, very fine fibres that are released and inhaled by humans, stated ACCC deputy chair, Catriona Lowe. We understand from expert advice that the risk of that in relation to these products is low because the asbestos is in effect naturally occurring and hasnt been ground down as such to release those fibres.\nInvestigations are ongoing as to how asbestos-containing material was distributed across the country for years, and often used by children who might inhale or ingest the material during use. The health concerns are obvious, even if the stated risks are low. The obvious reaction is to state that the material should have been tested when first imported, but such a policy would have a lot of caveats. Its simply not possible to test every item that enters the country for every possible contaminant. At the same time, one could argue that a mined sand product is more likely to contain asbestos than a box of Hot Wheels cars or a crate of Belgian chocolates. A measured guess would say this event will be ruled out as a freak occurrence, with authorities perhaps stepping up random spot checks on these products to try and limit the damage if similar contamination occurs again in future.\nFeatured image and other sand product images from the Australian governments recall page.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u767a\u899a\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u6c5a\u67d3\u306e\u771f\u76f8", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u5b66\u6821\u304c\u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u6c5a\u67d3\u3002\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u7802\u306b\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u767a\u899a\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u6c5a\u67d3\u306e\u771f\u76f8", "- \u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u7802\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u898f\u5236\u306e\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u306e\u4e0d\u6e2c\u306e\u4e8b\u614b", "- \u5b66\u6821\u9589\u9396\u3092\u62db\u3044\u305f\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u7802\u3068\u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u554f\u984c", "- \u30a2\u30b9\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u542b\u6709\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

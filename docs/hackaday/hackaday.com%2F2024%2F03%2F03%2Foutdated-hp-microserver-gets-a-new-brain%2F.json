[jacksonliam] decided to restomod it by installing a mini PC into the drive bay.\nThe HP N54L MicroServer was still running, but its soldered CPU and non-standard motherboard made a simple upgrade impossible. Evaluating the different options, [jacksonliam] decided to save the case and PSU by transplanting an Intel Alder Lake mini PC into the drive bay with 3D printed brackets and heat set inserts.\nSelecting a fanless router model to increase reliability, he was able to find an M.2 to mini-SAS adapter to attach the four drive cage to the NVME slot on the new PC. Power is supplied via the 12 V line on the ATX power supply and one of the mini PCs Ethernet lines was broken out to a 3D printed PCI slot cover.\nLooking for more ways to rejuvenate an old computer? How about putting a Mac mini inside an old iMac or a Raspberry Pi inside an Apple ][?", "title": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30d9\u30a4\u306b\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01HP MicroServer\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u53e4\u3044HP MicroServer\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044mini PC\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30d9\u30a4\u306b\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01HP MicroServer\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5", "HP MicroServer\u3092\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c9\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30df\u30cbPC\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b", "HP N54L MicroServer\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080", "\u53e4\u3044HP MicroServer\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30ebAlder Lake\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01HP MicroServer\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30d9\u30a4\u306b\u30df\u30cbPC\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051"]}

But what he learned about centimeter-resolution GPS is pretty interesting, especially for owners of large rural properties like him.\n[Ben]s mapping needs are less rigorous than an official survey; he just wants to get the locations of features like streams and wood lines, and to get topographic elevations so that he has a general lay of the land for planning purposes. He originally engaged a surveyor for that job, but after shelling out $4,600 to locate a single property line, he decided to see what else could be done. Luckily, real-time kinematics, or RTK, holds the key. RTK uses a fixed GPS station to provide correction signals to a mobile receiver, called a rover. If the fixed stations position is referenced to some monument of known position, the rovers position can be placed on a map to within a couple of centimeters.\nTo build his own RTK system, [Ben] used some modules from SparkFun. The fixed station has an RTK breakout board and a multi-band GNSS antenna to receive positioning data, along with a Raspberry Pi to run the RTK server. An old iPhone with a prepaid SIM provides backhaul to connect to the network that provides correction data. [Ben]s rover setup also came mainly from SparkFun, with an RTK Facet receiver mounted on a photographers monopod. Once everything was set up and properly calibrated, he was able to walk his property with the rover and measure locations to within 4 centimeters.\nThis was not an inexpensive endeavor  all told, [Ben] spent about $2,000 on the setup. Thats a lot, especially on top of what he already paid for the legal survey, but still a fraction of what it would have cost to have a surveyor do it, or to buy actual surveyors equipment. The post has a ton of detail thats worth reading for anyone interested in the process of mapping and GPS augmentation.", "title": "DIY\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044GPS\u5730\u56f3\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eRTK\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30014cm\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3067\u571f\u5730\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002300\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u6599\u91d1\u3057\u304b\u304b\u304b\u3089\u305a\u3001\u6e2c\u91cf\u58eb\u306b\u4f9d\u983c\u3059\u308b\u3088\u308a\u306f\u5b89\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044GPS\u5730\u56f3\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5cRTK\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u30e9\u30eb\u5730\u57df\u306e\u571f\u5730\u3092\u6e2c\u91cf", "$2,000\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u306aRTK\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u65b9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u5358\u4f4d\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3067\u571f\u5730\u306e\u6e2c\u91cf\u3092\u3059\u308b", "\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u6e2c\u91cf\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u5b89\u304f\u3066\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u571f\u5730\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b"]}

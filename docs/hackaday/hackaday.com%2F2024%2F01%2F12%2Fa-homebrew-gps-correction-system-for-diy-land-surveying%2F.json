But what he learned about centimeter-resolution GPS is pretty interesting, especially for owners of large rural properties like him.\n[Ben]s mapping needs are less rigorous than an official survey; he just wants to get the locations of features like streams and wood lines, and to get topographic elevations so that he has a general lay of the land for planning purposes. He originally engaged a surveyor for that job, but after shelling out $4,600 to locate a single property line, he decided to see what else could be done. Luckily, real-time kinematics, or RTK, holds the key. RTK uses a fixed GPS station to provide correction signals to a mobile receiver, called a rover. If the fixed stations position is referenced to some monument of known position, the rovers position can be placed on a map to within a couple of centimeters.\nTo build his own RTK system, [Ben] used some modules from SparkFun. The fixed station has an RTK breakout board and a multi-band GNSS antenna to receive positioning data, along with a Raspberry Pi to run the RTK server. An old iPhone with a prepaid SIM provides backhaul to connect to the network that provides correction data. [Ben]s rover setup also came mainly from SparkFun, with an RTK Facet receiver mounted on a photographers monopod. Once everything was set up and properly calibrated, he was able to walk his property with the rover and measure locations to within 4 centimeters.\nThis was not an inexpensive endeavor  all told, [Ben] spent about $2,000 on the setup. Thats a lot, especially on top of what he already paid for the legal survey, but still a fraction of what it would have cost to have a surveyor do it, or to buy actual surveyors equipment. The post has a ton of detail thats worth reading for anyone interested in the process of mapping and GPS augmentation."}

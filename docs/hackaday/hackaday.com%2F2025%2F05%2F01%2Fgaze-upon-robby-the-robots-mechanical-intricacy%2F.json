It looks simple, but as the video (embedded below) shows, re-creating it involves a load of moving parts and looks like a fantastic amount of work has gone into it. At least bearings are inexpensive and common nowadays, and not having to meet film deadlines also means one can afford to design things in a way that allows for easier disassembly and maintenance.\nRobby the Robot first appeared in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet and went on to appear in other movies and television programs. Robby went up for auction in 2017 and luckily [Mike] was able to take tons of reference photos. Combined with other enthusiasts efforts, his replica is shaping up nicely.\nWeve seen [Mike]s work before when he shared his radioactive Night Blossoms which will glow for decades to come. His work on Robby looks amazing, and we cant wait to see how it progresses.\n\n"}

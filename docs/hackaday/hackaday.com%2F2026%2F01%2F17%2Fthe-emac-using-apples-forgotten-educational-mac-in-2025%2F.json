(Credit: MattKC, YouTube)\nWhats it like to use a 2002-era Apple eMac all-in-one in 2025? Thats what [MattKC] asked himself after obtaining one of these systems from a seller who ominously mentioned that it had been left outside for years.\nThe Apple iMac is a bit of a cult symbol, whether youre talking about the iconic fruity iMac G3 or the desk lamp-like iMac G4, but few reminisce or actively collect the Apple eMac. Manufactured from 2002 to 2006, it featured the PowerPC 7450 (G4e) CPU with clock speeds ranging from 700 MHz to 1.42 GHz, as well as a 17 CRT. In terms of design it was basically a bland iMac G3 that was firmly targeting the education markets to try and regain market share after Windows PCs had begun to eat its lunch there.\nAs for the model that [MattKC] purchased, it was this earliest model, featuring a 700 MHz PowerPC G4 CPU in addition to 640 MB SDRAM. Despite the sellers description it seems to be in good nick with it firing right up, and even a glance inside after beating the challenge of 2.5 mm hex screws showed it to be in relatively good condition.\nUnlike the iMac G3, you can play the Mac port of Halo on it, but the Minecraft port is very much not performant. With generally multimedia and gaming working well, it does show why the eMac was released, as its quite capable relative to an iMac G3 which would have struggled with the educational software of the era. We definitely hope that [MattKC] restores it to its full glory instead of ripping out its innards, as the neglected status of the eMac makes it much more likely to go extinct than PowerPC-based iMacs.\n\n", "title": "- 2025\u5e74\u306b2002\u5e74\u88fdApple eMac\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u307f\u305f\uff01", "body": "2002\u5e74\u88fd\u306eApple eMac\u30922025\u5e74\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002eMac\u306f\u6559\u80b2\u5e02\u5834\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u610f\u5916\u3068\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- 2025\u5e74\u306b2002\u5e74\u88fdApple eMac\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u307f\u305f\uff01", "- Apple eMac\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6559\u80b2\u5e02\u5834\u3067\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1aApple eMac\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u63a2\u691c", "- eMac\u3068iMac G3\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u6804\u5149\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u623b\u3059\uff1fApple eMac\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85"]}

But five decades ago this was by no means a given, and when Tektronix shipped their P7001 digitiser module for their high-end oscilloscopes in 1971, they were initially designed to interface with a minicomputer. Not everybody has a PDP/11 lying around in 2023, but [Holger L\u00fcbben] wasnt fazed by this. He set about creating a USB interface for this ancient piece of test equipment.\nAt its heart is a Teensy 4.1 which does the job of interfacing with the Tektronix 16-bit bus through a level shifting transceiver. The software for the Teensy comes with some demos, but sadly not the Tek BASIC of the original. Were particularly impressed with the care to make the card frame for the module resemble as closely as possible an original Tektronix product.\nWere guessing very few of you will have this ancient test module on your bench, but the depth into which he goes over its internal design and programming makes this very much worth a read. If you fancy more vintage Tek goodness, take a look at this current probe.", "title": "\"1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u30922023\u5e74\u306b\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\"", "body": "1971\u5e74\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7P7001\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u5f53\u521d\u306f\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u60f3\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001Holger L\u00fcbben\u6c0f\u306fTeensy 4.1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3053\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u306bUSB\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8a2d\u8a08\u3084\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u30922023\u5e74\u306b\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\"", "\"P7001 Digitiser Module\u306eUSB\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"Teensy 4.1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u53e4\u3044\u6e2c\u5b9a\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u306eUSB\u63a5\u7d9a\"", "\"Tektronix\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30a4\u30b6\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\"", "\"\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u5fa9\u5143 - \u5143\u306eTektronix\u88fd\u54c1\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u67a0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\""]}

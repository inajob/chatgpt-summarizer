It isnt easy, though; those inscrutable black epoxy blobs dont give up their secrets easily, with most decapping methods being some combination of toxic and dangerous. Isnt there something better than acid baths and spinning bits of tungsten carbide?\n[Janne] over at Fraktal thinks so, and the answer he came up with is laser decapping. Specifically, this is an extension of the laser fault injection setup we recently covered, which uses a galvanometer-scanned IR laser to induce glitches in decapped microcontrollers to get past whatever security may be baked into the silicon. The current article continues that work and begins with a long and thorough review of various IC packaging technologies, including the important anatomical differences. Theres also a great review of the pros and cons of many decapping methods, covering everything from the chemical decomposition of epoxy resins to thermal methods. Thats followed by specific instructions on using the LFI rig to gradually ablate the epoxy and expose the die, which is then ready to reveal its secrets.\nThe benefit of leveraging the LFI rig for decapping is obvious  its an all-in-one tool for gaining access and executing fault injection. The usual caveats apply, of course, especially concerning safety; youll obviously want to avoid breathing the vaporized epoxy and remember that lasers and retinas dont mix. But with due diligence, having a single low-cost tool to explore the innards of chips seems like a big win to us."}

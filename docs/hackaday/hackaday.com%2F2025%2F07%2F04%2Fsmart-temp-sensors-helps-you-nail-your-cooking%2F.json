To aid in this regard, [Printerforge] created a smart temperature alarm to keep them aware of exactly whats going on in the pot.\nThe device is simple  it uses an Arduino Nano hooked up to a thermistor to measure the temperature of fluid in a pot. The microcontroller displays the current temperature and the target temperature on a simple 162 character LCD. Upon the fluid reaching the target temperature, the alarm is sounded, indicating that the cooking has reached a given stage or must otherwise be seen to. The whole build is wrapped up in a simple 3D printed case, along with a lithium-ion cell with charging managed via a TP4056 module.\nIf youre regularly letting your pasta overcook or your stews burn in the pot, this kind of tool could be useful for you. Similarly, if youve ever wanted to pursue the 64-degree egg, this could be a way to do it.\u00a0 The trick is to make sure you build it safely\u2014ensuring that any parts that come into contact with the food are rated as food safe for your given application.\nIf this build has you contemplating the possibilities of machine-assisted cooking, you might like to go even further. How about getting involved in the world of sous vide?

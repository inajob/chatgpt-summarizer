This has resulted in a much quicker passage through some borders as automatic barriers can replace human officials, but at the same time, it adds an opaque layer to the process. Just what data is on your passport, and can you read it for yourself? [Terence Eden] wanted to find out.\nThe write-up explains whats on the passport and how to access it. Surprisingly, its a straightforward process, unlike, for example, the NFC on a bank card. Security against drive-by scanning is provided by the key being printed on the passport, requiring the passport to be physically opened.\n He notes that its not impossible to brute force this key, though doing so reveals little thats not printed on the document. The write-up reveals a piece of general-purpose technical knowledge we should all know. However, theres a question were left with that it doesnt answer. If we can read the data on a passport chip, could a passport forger thus create a counterfeit one? If any readers are in the know, wed be interested to hear more in the comments. If you are into NFC hacking, maybe you need a handy multitool.\nHeader: [Tony Webster], CC BY-SA 4.0.", "title": "- NFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "body": "\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306eNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8a18\u9332\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u507d\u9020\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u793a\u5506\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- NFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u96a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u7269\u7406\u7684\u306b\u958b\u3051\u3066\u78ba\u8a8d\uff01\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3", "- \u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- NFC\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u89b3\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308b\u30d1\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u771f\u5b9f"]}

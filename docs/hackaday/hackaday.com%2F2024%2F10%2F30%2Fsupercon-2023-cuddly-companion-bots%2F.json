All these robots had smarts, capability, and agency. More than that, though\u2014they were faithful(ish) companions to humans, fulfilling what that role entails.\nThe thing is, were not gonna get robots like that unless somebody builds them. [Angela Sheehan] is a artist and an educator, and a maker\u2014and shes trying to create exactly that. She came down to the 2023 Hackaday Supercon to tell us all about her efforts to create cuddly companion bots for real.\n\nBeep Boop\n\nYou might remember Angela from her 2019 Supercon costume\u2014she showed up dressed as a color-changing fairy. In fact, she has dabbled in all kinds of fields, which has given her a broad skillset applicable to creating companion bots. Shes done lots of costuming and cosplay over the years, shes worked in product design, and she brands herself a bit of a fashion hacker. These skills might not be particularly relevant to building a high-speed industrial robot arm to perform 2000 welds an hour. However, they come in absolute clutch when youre trying to build a robot that acts as a soft, cuddly companion. She notes that she was inspired to create her own companion bots by the work of others formerly showcased by Hackaday\u2014you might remember work in this field from Alex Glow and Jorvon Moss.\nThats Nova, right there!\nAngelas talk soon tackles the elephant in the room\u2014from the drop, youve probably been wondering about the cute critter perched on her shoulder. The long-tailed creature is named Nova, and shes remarkably friendly and soothing once you get to know her.\nDevelopment took some time, with Angela doing lots of research and development to create the Nova we see today. I actually did a lot of the prototyping and field testing for this bot in the library makerspace that I work at, she explains. It was great to see people who dont know the inside and out of technology interact with [Nova] and I could pinpoint the moment that she became alive to people. The bot got quite a response, transcending the level of basic machine to something a little more. People wanted to come in and visit her and pet her, says Angela. That was such a powerful moment that happened as soon as I started putting a face on her. Angela doesnt just tell the tale\u2014during the talk, she passes Nova to the audience so they can interact with her up close. She explains that this is something that she does regularly\u2014and we get to see photos of the lovely interactions Nova has had with dozens of smiling, happy people.\n[Angela] covers some of the tools and techniques she used to develop her robot companion. At times, she looked to commercial products to figure out how to make something thats properly cuddleable.Nova leverages Angelas skills in sewing, 3D modelling, and 3D printing. She explains how components like Novas wings were first drafted in Adobe Illustrator. From there, the structure was refined into actual models in Fusion 360, while a PCB was developed in Eagle for the lighting electronics.\nThe face, though, was perhaps most crucial\u2014as is the case for any anthropomorphic character. She took inspiration from Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon, using a stuffed toy as reference. Initial attempts werent particularly satisfying though, so she learned 3D sculpting for a further attempt in clay. Feedback from Twitter helped her develop the face further into the Nova we see today. The eyes were sourced from an Etsy supplier specializing in doll eyes. Angela notes theres some magic there\u2014when backlit with LEDs, switching them on and off can create a really believable blink pattern that feels super realistic. What are those elements that make it feel alive? Angela muses. There are just little pieces of the psychology of it that you can dial into and you can make something that feels very alive.\nPart of the development process was figuring out how to make the eyes and movements feel natural\u2014like a living creature rather than a pile of electronics, motors, and lights.\nThe talk then covers the rest of the design that helps create the illusion of life. Angela explains using servos and a robot gripper mechanism to flap the wings, and dialing in the motion so it felt as authentic as possible. She also covers robustness, designing cuddle-worthy bodies, and the value of designing for modularity. Theres also a useful discussion about how to make these builds more accessible, including useful starting points like which microcontroller and code platforms are good to use.\nEven better, we get a look into the companion bot community, and we learn about the emotional impact these robots can have. Sometimes thats intentional, other times, its down to a happy accident. There is an unintended effect with [Novas] servos, that it feels like a purr, says Angela. Its very comforting right on your shoulder, and I was thinking maybe I should try and insulate it a little bit, but actually people love it.\nNova puts smiles on faces wherever she goes. Angela is always letting people hold her and get to know her, and this kind of gleeful response is a common one.\nFundamentally, companion bots are a bit like virtual reality. Weve seen a ton of products make big promises over the years, but weve never seen a killer app. However, as [Angela] demonstrates, its very possible to create something very real and very lovable if you pay attention to the right things. Perhaps its the personal touch that makes DIY companion bots so seemingly lifelike in a way that Furby never was.\nIn any case, if youve ever wanted a robot companion of your very own, theres no reason you cant start building your own. With maker skills, enthusiasm, and the will to succeed, you can create a fun and cuddly robot critter that has that magical spark of life.\n", "title": "- \u300c\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u53cb\u9054\u3092\u4f5c\u308b: \u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30e9\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "body": "2024\u5e74\u3001Angela Sheehan\u306f\u611b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cNova\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002\u5f7c\u5973\u306fDIY\u3068\u60c5\u71b1\u3067\u3001\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u7652\u3057\u3092\u5c4a\u3051\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u53cb\u9054\u3092\u4f5c\u308b: \u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30e9\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "- \u300cNova: \u4eba\u3005\u3092\u7652\u3084\u3059\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a\u79d8\u8a71\u300d", "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u751f\u304d\u751f\u304d\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5275\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "- \u300cDIY\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8: \u611f\u60c5\u3092\u6301\u3064\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "- \u300c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u4ef2\u9593\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9: \u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30e9\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u300d"]}

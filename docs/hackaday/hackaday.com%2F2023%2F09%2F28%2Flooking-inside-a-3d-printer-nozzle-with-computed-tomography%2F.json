It doesnt seem like much of a mystery  the filament gets melty, it gets squeezed out by the pressure of the incoming unmelty filament, and lather, rinse, repeat. Or is there perhaps more to the story?\nTo find out, a team from the University of Stuttgart led by [Marc Kreutzbruck] took the unusual step of putting the business end of a 3D printer into a CT scanner, to get a detailed look at whats actually going on in there. The test setup consisted of a Bondtech LGX extruder and an E3D V6 hot end mounted to a static frame. There was no need for X-Y-Z motion control during these experiments, but a load cell was added to measure extrusion force. The filament was a bit specialized  high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) mixed with a little bit of tungsten powder added (1% by volume) for better contrast to X-ray. The test system was small enough to be placed inside a micro CT scanner, which generated both 360-degree computed tomography images and 2D radiographs.\nThe observations made with this experimental setup were pretty eye-opening. The main take-home message is that higher filament speed translates to less contact area between the nozzle wall and the melt, thanks to an air gap between the solid filament and the metal of the nozzle. They also saw an increased tendency for the incoming filament to buckle at high extruder speeds, which matches up with practical experience. Also, filament speed is more determinative of print quality (as measured by extrusion force) than heater temperature is. Although both obviously play a role, they recommend that if higher print speed is needed, the best thing to optimize is hot end geometry, specifically an extended barrel to allow for sufficient melting time.\nEarth-shattering stuff? Probably not, but its nice to see someone doing a systematic study on this, rather than relying on seat-of-the-pants observations. And the images are pretty cool too.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u89e3\u6790\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u77e5\u898b", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u69d8\u5b50\u3092CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3067\u8abf\u3079\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u307b\u3069\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u58c1\u3068\u6eb6\u878d\u7269\u306e\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\u7a4d\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3084\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5c48\u66f2\u306e\u50be\u5411\u304c\u898b\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5370\u5237\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3082\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u63a8\u5968\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u89e3\u6790\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u77e5\u898b", "\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u7a7a\u6c17\u5c64\u304c\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\u7a4d\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u304c\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u901f\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u91cd\u8981", "\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u306a\u7d4c\u9a13\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30de\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u89b3\u5bdf\u3068\u753b\u50cf\u5316"]}

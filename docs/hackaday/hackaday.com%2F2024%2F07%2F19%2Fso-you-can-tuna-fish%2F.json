But its 2024, after all. Shouldnt you be able to tune a fish by now? As [ChromaLock] shows us in the video below, its absolutely possible, and has been all along.\nOf course, you cant possibly put a rainbow trout (or any other fish) under tension until it produces audible tones. So, how does it work? [ChromaLock] turned to the skin, which functions electrically much like ours does with different resistance values in different areas.\nFrom there, it was a matter of hunting around for spots that produced different notes that sounded good, and marking them for later so it can be played like a potentiometer. But there were problems with this setup, mostly screeching between notes from stray voltages in the environment.\nAfter a brief detour using a PS/2 keyboard with spray-painted keycaps, [ChromaLock] said to hell with it and unearthed a regular MIDI keyboard. Armed with a 3D printed jig to hold the probes, [ChromaLock] tested everything with a cucumber, and then out came the trout for its musical debut. Be sure to check it out after the break.\nWhat else can you do with canned tuna and other fish? Cook up some pyrolized bread, and youve got yourself a foundry and crucible.\n\n\nThanks to [Zixxorb] for the tip!", "title": "\u9b5a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "2024\u5e74\u3001\u9b5a\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u76ae\u3092\u89e6\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u97f3\u3092\u51fa\u3059\u3002\u96fb\u6c17\u7684\u306b\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u808c\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u3001\u7570\u306a\u308b\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5834\u6240\u3067\u97f3\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3057\u3001MIDI\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u6f14\u594f\u3002\u713c\u304d\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u30d1\u30f3\u3067\u5de5\u5834\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u9b5a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u306eMIDI\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u9b5a\u3092\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308b", "\u9b5a\u306e\u76ae\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u9b5a\u3092\u697d\u5668\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30b0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9b5a\u306e\u6f14\u594f\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

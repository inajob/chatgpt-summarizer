But now, its time to turn it up a notch with 1\u00b5m garage semiconductor ambitions.\nThe e-beam lithography hes done in the past can achieve some impressive resolutions, but they arent very fast; a single beam of electrons needs to scan over the entire exposure area, somewhat like a tiny crayon. Thats not very scalable; he needed a better solution to make 1\u00b5m semiconductors.\nTest patterns from the first attempt\nIn his quest, he starts by trying to do maskless photolithography, using a literal projector to shine light on the target area all at once. After hacking a projector devkit apart, replacing blue with ultraviolet and adding custom optics, its time for a test. The process works for the most part but cant produce fine details the way [Breaking Taps] needs. Unfortunately, fixing that would mean tearing the whole set-up apart for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe photomask used in the reduction machine\nIn either a genius move, or the typical hacker tangent energy, he decides not to completely re-build the maskless lithography machine, but instead uses it to create masks for use in a 10:1 reduction machine, also known as the more traditional mask photolithography. In the end, this works out well for him, reaching just about 2 \u00b5m effective minimum feature size in this two-step process.\nWe havent even remotely covered everything and there are, of course, always things to improve. And who knows? Maybe well see 1\u00b5m semiconductors from [Breaking Taps] in the future.\n"}

But now, its time to turn it up a notch with 1\u00b5m garage semiconductor ambitions.\nThe e-beam lithography hes done in the past can achieve some impressive resolutions, but they arent very fast; a single beam of electrons needs to scan over the entire exposure area, somewhat like a tiny crayon. Thats not very scalable; he needed a better solution to make 1\u00b5m semiconductors.\nTest patterns from the first attempt\nIn his quest, he starts by trying to do maskless photolithography, using a literal projector to shine light on the target area all at once. After hacking a projector devkit apart, replacing blue with ultraviolet and adding custom optics, its time for a test. The process works for the most part but cant produce fine details the way [Breaking Taps] needs. Unfortunately, fixing that would mean tearing the whole set-up apart for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe photomask used in the reduction machine\nIn either a genius move, or the typical hacker tangent energy, he decides not to completely re-build the maskless lithography machine, but instead uses it to create masks for use in a 10:1 reduction machine, also known as the more traditional mask photolithography. In the end, this works out well for him, reaching just about 2 \u00b5m effective minimum feature size in this two-step process.\nWe havent even remotely covered everything and there are, of course, always things to improve. And who knows? Maybe well see 1\u00b5m semiconductors from [Breaking Taps] in the future.\n", "title": "\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a1\u00b5m\u306e\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u306b\u6311\u6226", "body": "[Breaking Taps]\u306f\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u30011\u03bcm\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u904e\u53bb\u306b\u96fb\u5b50\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u518d\u5efa\u7bc9\u306f\u305b\u305a\u300110:1\u7e2e\u5c0f\u6a5f\u3067\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 2 \u03bcm\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5fb4\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u9054\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a1\u00b5m\u306e\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u5149\u9020\u5f62\uff1a1\u00b5m\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5", "\u5149\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3", "\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6b21\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a10:1\u7e2e\u5c0f\u6a5f\u306e\u5229\u7528", "[Breaking Taps]\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a1\u00b5m\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

Almost everything with a processor can run the 1993 shooter, but as it ages, this becomes less of a challenge. More modern games are starting to move into this position, and Factorio may be taking a leading position. [Point Substantial] has gotten this game to run on a mobile phone.\nThe minimum system requirements for Factorio are enough to make this a challenge, especially compared to vintage title like DOOM. For Linux systems a dual-core processor and 8 GB of memory are needed, as well as something with at least 1 GB of VRAM. [Point_Substantial]s Xiaomi Mi 9T almost meets these official minimum requirements, with the notable exception of RAM. This problem was solved by adding 6 GB of swap space to make up for the difference.\nThe real key to getting this running is that this phone doesnt run Android, it runs the Linux-only postmarketOS. Since its a full-fledged Linux distribution rather than Android, it can run any software any other Linux computer can, including Steam. And it can also easily handle inputs for periphreals including a Switch Pro controller, which is important because this game doesnt have touch inputs programmed natively.\nThe other tool that [Point_Substantial] needed was box86/box64, a translation layer to run x86 code on ARM. But with all the pieces in place its quite possible to run plenty of games semi-natively on a system like this. In fact, wed argue its a shame that more phones dont have support for Linux distributions like postmarketOS based on the latest news about Android.\nThanks to [Keith] for the tip!", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01Factorio\u3092Linux\u4e0a\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "DOOM\u306e\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3059\u308bFactorio\u304c\u3001Linux\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306fSteam\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01Factorio\u3092Linux\u4e0a\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- DOOM\u304b\u3089Factorio\u3078\uff1a\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- postmarketOS\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3001Linux\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u65b0\u5e38\u8b58", "- Xiaomi Mi 9T\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u6700\u5c0f\u8981\u4ef6\u3068\u305d\u306e\u514b\u670d\u6cd5", "- ARM\u4e0a\u3067x86\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\uff1abox86/box64\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u8853"]}

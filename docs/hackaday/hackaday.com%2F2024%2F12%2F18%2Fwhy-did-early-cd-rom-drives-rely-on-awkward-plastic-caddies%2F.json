If we do, its generally with a slot-loading console or car stereo, or an old-school tray-loader in a desktop or laptop. This has been the dominant way of using consumer optical media for some time.\nStep back to the early CD-ROM era, though, and things were a little kookier. Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, drives hit the market that required the use of a bulky plastic caddy to load discs. The question is\u2014why did we apparently need caddies then, and why dont we use them any longer?\nCaddyshack\nEarly CD players, like this top-loading Sony D-50, didnt use caddies.

It quickly became a popular format for music, offering far higher fidelity than existing analog formats like vinyl and cassettes. The CD-ROM followed in 1985, offering hundreds of megabytes of storage in an era when most hard drives barely broke 30 MB. The discs used lasers to read patterns of pits and lands from a reflective aluminum surface, encased in tough polycarbonate plastic. Crucially, the discs featured robust error correction techniques so that small scratches, dust, or blemishes wouldnt stop a disc from working.\nNotably, the first audio CD player\u2014the Sony CDP-101\u2014was a simple tray-loading machine. Phillips first effort, the CD100, was a top-loader. Neither used a caddy. Nor did the first CD-ROM drives\u2014the Phillips CM100 was not dissimilar from the CD100, and tray loaders were readily available too, like the Amdek Laserdrive-1.\nSony had the most popular design for CD caddies.

The concept had existed prior to CDs, most notably for the failed Capacitance Electronic Disc format created by RCA. Those discs were highly susceptible to problems with dust, so they were kept in caddies for their protection. For CDs, the caddy wasnt a necessity\u2014the plastic optical discs were robust enough to be handled directly. And yet, in the late 1980s, caddy CD-ROM drives started to become the norm in the nascent market, with Apple and Sony perhaps the most notable early adopters.\nApples early drives\u2014both internal and external\u2014relied on caddies.

Various non-compatible versions existed from different manufacturers, but the intent was the same. The CD itself was placed in a plastic case with some kind of sliding shutter. This case protected the CD from scratches, dust, smudges, and other contaminants. When it was placed in a drive, the shutter would slide or rotate out of the way, allowing access for the optical head to read the disc.\nFor many early applications, CD-ROMs were very much an archival format. They offered long-term storage, were non-writable, and had huge capacity. They were perfect for creating digital encyclopedias, with a single disc able to replace a stack of bound volumes that would take up a whole shelf. They were also perfect for commercial or industry use, where large databases or reference volumes could be stored in a far smaller format than ever before.\nPlenty of reference materials were delivered via CD-ROM, and they didnt come cheap\u2014as per this Sony catalog from 1991.\nIn these cases, though, its important to remember that CDs were quite expensive. For example, in 1986, a copy of Groliers Academic Encyclopedia would cost $199\u2014or roughly $570 in todays money. As robust as CDs were, it was at times desirable to protect such an investment with the added safety and security of a caddy. This was particularly useful in library, school, and business contexts, too, where end users couldnt always be relied upon to use the discs gently.\nCaddies also offered another side benefit of particular use to the radio industry. They made it very quick and easy to change discs, easing the work of on-air DJs as they cued up songs. Compare the ease of slamming in a cartridge, versus extracting a disc from a jewel case and gently placing it in a tray-loading drive. Under the pressure of a live broadcast, its clear to see the benefit of the caddy design. Particularly as sloppy handling would quickly damage discs that were on heavy rotation.\nCaddies made sense at a time when the CDs and their content were incredibly expensive. They also made sense for professional media and corporate users. However, for the consumer, they quickly became a frustration rather than a boon.\nThis 8x caddy-loading CD-ROM drive was built by NEC.

Caddies added a certain level of expense that became less justified as the price of CD-ROM titles came down. The intent was that users would have a caddy for each disc in their collection, protecting the CDs and making them easy to load. However, many home users only had one or a handful of caddies. This meant users were often swapping discs from caddy to caddy, with the repetitive manual handling negating any benefit of the caddies in the first place. It quickly became an unwelcome chore for owners of caddy-loading drives.\nAs is the way, the market soon responded. By the late 1990s, caddy-based CD drives had mostly disappeared from the consumer market in favor of more convenient, caddy-free drives. Customers wanted easy-to-use drives, and they had no desire to put up with fussy plastic cases that were ultimately unnecessary. Tray-loaders became the norm for most CD-ROM applications, with slot loaders becoming more popular as a fancier option in some premium hardware.\nCaddy CD players were popular in the radio world.

Similarly, some early DVD-RAM drives relied on caddies too, as have various high-capacity optical archive standards. In these applications, caddies were chosen for two reasons\u2014they were there to protect media that was either particularly delicate, valuable, or both. In the vast majority of cases, the caddy became an integral part of the media\u2014rather than an external cart which discs could be swapped into and out of.\nCaddy-based CD drives represent a transitional period in the early days of optical media. The lines between serious archival users and home users were blurred, and nobody quite knew where the technology was going. They highlight a period when engineers and manufacturers were still exploring the best methods build reliable drives that best met their users needs. From a consumer perspective, these protective devices are now curious relics in the post-optical era\u2014a reminder of when laser-based media was on the absolute cutting edge of technology.

Companies fail or get traded, technologies evolve, and theres also an economic argument against creating parts for things that are extremely old or werent popular in the first place. So, for something like restoring an old car, you might have to resort to fabricating replacement parts for your build on your own. [MangoJelly] shows us how to build our own replacement parts in FreeCAD in this series of videos.\nThe build does assume that the original drawings or specifications for the part are still available, but with those in hand FreeCAD is capable of importing them and then the model scaling to match the original specs shown. This video goes about recreating a hinge on an old truck, so with the drawings in hand the part is essentially traced out using the software, eventually expanding it into all three dimensions using all of the tools available in FreeCAD. One of the keys to FreeCAD is the various workbenches available that all have their own sets of tools, and being able to navigate between them is key to a build like this.\nFreeCAD itself is an excellent tool for anyone repairing old vehicles like this or those making 3D prints, designing floorplans for houses, or really anything you might need to model in a computer before bringing the idea into reality. It does have a steep learning curve (not unlike other CAD software) so it helps to have a video series like this if youre only just getting started or looking to further hone your design skills, but the fact that its free and open-source make it extremely attractive compared to its competitors.\n\n\n", "title": "FreeCAD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u53e4\u3044\u8eca\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u518d\u751f", "body": "\u88fd\u9020\u4f1a\u793e\u304c\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6c38\u7d9a\u7684\u306b\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4ee3\u66ff\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002FreeCAD\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u518d\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002FreeCAD\u306f\u8eca\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u30843D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u4eba\u306a\u3069\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u7528\u9014\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["FreeCAD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u53e4\u3044\u8eca\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u518d\u751f", "\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u624b\u306b\u5165\u3089\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u53e4\u3044\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\uff1aFreeCAD", "FreeCAD\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba", "\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff1aFreeCAD\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30b3\u30c4"]}

Still, its a frontier that still has a way to go, even if [Yunus Zenichowski]s 489 megapixel prototype is a bit of an outlier. As some of you may have guessed its a scanner camera, in which the sensor is a linear CCD that is mechanically traversed over the focal plane to capture the image line by line.\nIn the 3D printed shell are the guts of a cheap second-hand Canon scanner, and the lens comes from a projector. Both these components make it not only one of the highest resolution cameras weve ever brought you, but also by no means the most expensive. Its definitely a work in progress and the results of a sensor designed for the controlled environment of a document scanner being used with real-world light leave something to be desired, but even with the slight imperfections of the projector lens its still a camera capable of some fascinating high-resolution photography. The files are all available, should you be interested, and you can see it in action in the video below the break.\nIts by no means the first scanner camera weve brought you, though some of the earlier projects now have dead links. It is however easily the one with the highest resolution.\n\n", "title": "4\u51048900\u4e07\u753b\u7d20\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "10\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30e1\u30ac\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u6226\u4e89\u3067\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u3067\u52dd\u8ca0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u3067\u306f\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3068\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u753b\u8cea\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u524d\u9032\u306b\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9053\u306e\u308a\u304c\u6b8b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f489\u30e1\u30ac\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u4e2d\u53e4\u306e\u30ad\u30e4\u30ce\u30f3\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u5c11\u3057\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3067\u3082\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306e\u5199\u771f\u304c\u64ae\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["4\u51048900\u4e07\u753b\u7d20\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30ce\u30f3\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u6539\u9020", "\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u6d41\u7528", "\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u5199\u771f\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u958b\u767a\u304c\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b", "\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u53ef\u80fd"]}

This family of robots aims to be highly dexterous, interactive, and general-purpose by applying the sort of non-task-specific training methods that have worked so well with LLMs, and applying them to robot tasks.\n<!-- more -->\nThere are two things we here at Hackaday are wondering. Is there anything a robot will never do? And just how cherry-picked are these examples in the slick video? Let us know what you think in the comments!\n\n", "title": "- Gemini\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044ALOHARobot\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Google\u304cGemini Robotics\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001ALOHARobot\u306f\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u52d5\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- Gemini\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044ALOHARobot\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u5b9f\u884c\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308bGemini 2.0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u9ad8\u3044\u5bfe\u8a71\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u591a\u76ee\u7684\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a", "- LLM\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5fdc\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3068\u306f\uff1fHackaday\u306e\u7591\u554f\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

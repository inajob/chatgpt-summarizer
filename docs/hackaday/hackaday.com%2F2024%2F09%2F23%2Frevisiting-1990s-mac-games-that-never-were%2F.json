This repository has a few of the games complete with their development files and the compiler environment, a mixture of Think Pascal and C.\nBack then, [John] had a solid mantra when creating projects, specifically prototyping fast and abandoning things quickly if they were not working out. The blog shows a list of twenty-eight projects, of which only five ever made it to release, with all the rest left to rot. This is reminiscent of the attitude around Silicon Valley of moving fast and breaking things. Anyway, reasons for ditching a project ranged from too much sprite work for a DnD style game to simply not fun for some with clunky control mechanisms. [John] even abandoned a neat-looking steampunk flight simulator due to the sheer amount of work needed. Of course, its not all lost effort. Much of the code written was reused across multiple projects; after all, theres no point in re-writing a cosine lookup table if youve already got one kicking around in another project.\nStill, its a fun trip down memory lane, looking deep into projects that never were and the development journey to becoming a successful programmer.\nWhile it isnt hard to find old Macintosh hardware, some are not in great shape. Heres a fun Hackintosh project that uses retro parts. [John] was featured a while back, with his homage to his first mac, a sleek Rpi-powered eInk desk ornament. Finally, we cant talk about recovering retro software without\u00a0looking in detail at the floppy disk themselves."}

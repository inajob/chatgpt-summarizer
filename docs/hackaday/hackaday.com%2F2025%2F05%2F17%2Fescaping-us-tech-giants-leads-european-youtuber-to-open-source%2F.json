Who knew?\nHe also gives his experiences with NextCloud (also German), can be used as an OSS alternative Google Workspaces that weve written about before, but then admits that he was the sole user on his instance. To which one must question: if youre the sole user, why do you need a cloud-based collaborative environment? To try it out before getting collaborators involved, presumably.\nRegardless what you think of the politics motivating this video, its great to see open source getting greater traction. While [TechAltar] was looking for European alternatives, part of the glory of open source is that it doesnt matter where youre from, you can still contribute. (Unless youre Russian.) Have you found yourself using more open source software (or hardware) of late? Do you think the current political climate could lead to a broadening of its reach? Is this the year of the linux desktop? Let us know what you think in the comments. \n", "title": "- \u7c73\u56fd\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c4\u306a\u3057\u306e1\u30f6\u6708\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "body": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u907f\u3051\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3002\u30d0\u30e9\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3\u3042\u308b\u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6848\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7c73\u56fd\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c4\u306a\u3057\u306e1\u30f6\u6708\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u88fd\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u4f53\u9a13", "- NextCloud\uff1a\u4e00\u4eba\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u74b0\u5883\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u3068\u305d\u306e\u610f\u7fa9", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8131\u51fa\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u63a2\u6c42"]}

Thats why its nice to see this exploit of the Canon imageCLASS MF74XCdw series (MF742Cdw/MF743Cdw) by [blasty], triggerable over a network connection, with a story for our amusement.\nIn this post, we get a tale of how this hack came out of a Pwn2Own Toronto challenge, notes on the hardware involved, and were shown the journey to a successful hack. The Canon printer OS is built without many of the protections, which makes playing with it easier than with more modernized targets, but its nevertheless not straightforward. Still, exploiting a couple things like the SOAP XML implementation and the UTF8 encoder nets you an ability to play nice animations on the display, and most certainly, control over the entirety of the hardware if you wanted it.\nOne of the most fun things about this hack is the GDB stub recently included in the repo. If you wanted to debug Canon printers for fun or profit, [blasty] brings you a GDB stub to do that comfortably, with a respectable README that even has porting notes for other Canon ImageCLASS printer models, should you lay your hands on a different machine of despair. WiFi connectivity appears to be enough for this hack, so you better make sure you dont have your network-connected printers exposed on the Internet  not that you needed more reasons to avoid that.", "title": "Canon imageCLASS MF74XCdw\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6210\u529f", "body": "\u30ad\u30e4\u30ce\u30f3\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5\u304c\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30a4\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fdd\u8b77\u304c\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u3067\u3001SOAP XML\u5b9f\u88c5\u3084UTF8\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Canon imageCLASS MF74XCdw\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6210\u529f", "Canon\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3068GDB\u30b9\u30bf\u30d6", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u3055\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30ce\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a5\u7d9a\u7d4c\u7531\u3067\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "Canon\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3066\u8868\u793a\u306b\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u51fa\u529b"]}

It\u2019s then possible to determine the air speed by measuring the pressure difference between the side opening and the end facing into the wind. At speeds, temperatures, and altitudes that a hacker\u2019s likely to encounter (i.e. not on an airplane), the pressure difference is pretty small, and it\u2019s only since the advent of MEMS pressure sensors that pitot tubes became practical for amateurs.[Franci]\u2019s design is based on a Sensiron SDP differential pressure sensor, a 3D-printed pitot tube structure, some tubing, and the microcontroller of your choice. It\u2019s important to position the tube well, so that it doesn\u2019t experience airflow disturbances from other structures and faces straight into the air flow. Besides good positioning, the airspeed calculation requires you to know the air temperature and absolute pressure.[Franci] also describes a more exotic averaging pitot tube, a fairly simple variation which measures air speed in cavities more accurately. He notes that this provides a more inexpensive way of measuring air flow in ducts than air conditioning flow sensors, while being more resilient than propeller-based solutions \u2013 he himself used pitot tubes to balance air flow in his home\u2019s ventilation. All of the necessary CAD files and Arduino code are available on his GitHub repository.If you\u2019re looking for a more conventional duct flow meter, we\u2019ve covered one before. We\u2019ve even seen a teardown of a pitot tube sensor system from a military drone.", "title": "- \u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7528\u9014", "body": "\u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u306f\u7a7a\u6c17\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b versatile\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002MEMS\u5727\u529b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3001CAD\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068Arduino\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7528\u9014", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u306e\u7a7a\u6c17\u6d41\u901f\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1", "- MEMS\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u7a7a\u8abf\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30c8\u30fc\u7ba1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u89e3\u8aac"]}

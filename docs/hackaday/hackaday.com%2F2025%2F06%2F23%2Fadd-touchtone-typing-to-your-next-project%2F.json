However, the old flip phone crowd had just a few telephone keys to work with. If you have a key-limited project, maybe check out the libt9 library from [FoxMoss].\nThere were two methods for using these limited keyboards, both of which relied on the letters above a phone keys number. For example, the number 2 should have ABC above it, or, sometimes, below it.\nIn one scheme, youd press the two key multiple times quickly to get the letter you wanted. One press was 2 while two rapid presses made up A. If you waited too long, you were entering the next letter (so pressing two, pausing, and pressing it again would give you 22 instead of A).\n\nThats a pain, as you might imagine. The T9 system was a bit better. It knows about words. So if you press, for example, 843 it knows you probably meant the, a common word. Thats better than 884444333 or, if the digit is last in the rotation, 844433. Of course, that assumes you are using one of the 75,000 or so words the library knows about.\nIf you just want to try it, theres a website. Now imagine writing an entire text message or e-mail like that.\nOf course, theres the Blueberry, if you really want physicality. We love that old Blackberry keyboard."}

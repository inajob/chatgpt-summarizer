On June 7th this year, [Don Lancaster] passed away. [Brad] from Tech Time Traveller paid tribute to [Don] in a recent video.\u00a0 [Don Lancaster] was perhaps best known as the designer of the TV Typewriter.\u00a0 The Typewriter drew characters on a TV screen when the user typed on a keyboard. It was the fundamental part of a simple terminal. This was quite an accomplishment in 1973 when the article was first published.\n[Don] embodied the hacker spirit by figuring out low-cost (cheap) ways to overcome obstacles. His genius was his ability to communicate his methods in a way even non-technical people could understand. Keyboards are a great example. Back in the 1970s a simple keyboard cost hundreds of dollars. [Don] figured out how to build one from scratch and published an article explaining how to do it.\nLike many people we cover here on Hackaday, [Don] was quite a character. His website layout hasnt changed much since the 1990s, but the content has grown. To say he was a prolific writer would be an understatement. PostScript, Magic Sinewaves, and patents are just a few of his favorite topics. [Dons] recent work involved the research of prehistoric canals in the American Southwest.\nEveryone here at Hackaday sends our deepest condolences to Dons family.\n\n\nFeatured image from [Brads] Tech Time Traveller video thumbnail.

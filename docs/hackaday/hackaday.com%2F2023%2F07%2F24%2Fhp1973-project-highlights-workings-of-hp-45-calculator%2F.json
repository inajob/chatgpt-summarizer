Over a year ago, she wrote an HP-45 emulator for use on a terminal, dubbed HP45TERM. Not content with success, she upped the challenge and decided to build an even better emulator with a full-featured GUI written in Python. Oh, and she made it multi-platform as well. The result is the HP1973 project.\n[Sarah] thought it would take just a few days, but it grew into a much bigger project, as often happens. Were glad it did because the results are fantastic. The emulator gives you access not only to the calculator itself but can see everything under the hood. The emulator provides full ROM visibility, hardware registers, and standard debugging operations like single stepping. ROM images are available for the HP-45, the HP-35, and the HP-80. The GUI display is configurable, and theres a plethora of help and information explaining the calculators internals. Pre-built binaries are available for MacOS, Windows, and Python source code (3.10.10+) for all operating systems (youll need to `pip install numpy` first). The emulation is faithful to the original calculator, and even the hidden timer function can be accessed.\nCheck this out if youre into retro calculators. Our own Al Williams wrote about the history of the HP-35 back in 2018 if you want to learn more. Thanks to [J Peterson] for sending in the tip."}

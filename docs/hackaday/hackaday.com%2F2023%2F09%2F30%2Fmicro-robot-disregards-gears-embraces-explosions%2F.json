It has enough power to make some very impressive jumps. The ability to navigate even with such limited actuators is reminiscent of hopped-up bristebots.\nElectronic control of combustions in the joints allows for up to 100 explosions per second, which is enough force to do useful work. The prototype is only 29 millimeters long and weighs only 1.6 grams, but it can jump up to 56 centimeters and move at almost 17 centimeters per second.\nThe prototype is tethered, so those numbers dont include having to carry its own power or fuel supply, but as a proof of concept its pretty interesting. Reportedly a downside is that the process is rather noisy, which we suppose isnt surprising.\nWant to see it in action? Watch the video (embedded below) to get an idea of what its capable of. More details are available from the research paper, as well.\n\n"}

Of course theres no real CD in there, instead the software lives on a piece of flash memory. Its usually not a problem as they also appear on the USB bus as their true calling, but not always.\n[Martijn Braam] found himself the lucky owner of a USB network adapter which seemed to see its only purpose in life to be such a drive, and since he\u00a0 wasnt anxious to make another piece of e-waste, he broke it open to see if the fake CD drive could be disabled.\nInside the flimsy case he found a CoreChips SR9700 Ethernet controller, a chip for which there seems to be very little data in the wild. On the underside of the PCB was a flash chip, and as expected disabling this caused the CD drive to disappear to be replaced by the expected network card.\nIts a simple but useful hack, but theres a little bonus for those unaware in the write-up. Theres a piece of software called USB_modeswitch that can perform this task on many cards, which is worth storing away in the event that its needed.", "title": "USB\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3CD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "USB\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u3092\u542b\u3080\u4eee\u60f3CD-ROM\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u50be\u5411\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002USB\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306f\u540c\u69d8\u3067\u3001\u89e3\u653e\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8abf\u3079\u305f\u3002SR9700\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3068\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["USB\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3CD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4e0d\u8981\u306a\u4eee\u60f3CD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u6301\u3064USB\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806", "\u4e0d\u8981\u306aCD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u6301\u3064USB\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u89e3\u6790\u3068\u6539\u9020", "USB_modeswitch\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4eee\u60f3CD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306eUSB\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

For those that want to roll their own voice assistant, or just get avoid the corporate surveillance of it all, [Justin Alveys] work may appeal. (Nitter)\n[Justin] pulled apart a Nest Mini, ripped out the original PCB,\u00a0 and kitted it out with his own internals. He uses the ESP32 as the basis of his design, since it provides plenty of processing power and WiFi connectivity. His\u00a0 replacement PCB also interfaces with the LEDs, mute switch, and capacitive touch features of the Nest Mini, for ease of interaction.\nAs a demo, he set up the system to work with a custom Maubot assistant using the Matrix framework. He hooked it up with Beeper, a messaging client that collates all your other messaging platforms into one easily-accessible place. The assistant employs GPT3.5, prompted with a list of his family, friends, and other details, to enable him to make calls, send messages, and handle natural language queries. The demo itself is very impressive, and wed love to try setting up a similar assistant ourselves. Seeing two of [Justins] builds talking to each other is amusing, too.\nIf youre more comfortable working with Google Assistant rather than dropping it entirely, weve looked at that kind of thing, too. Video after the break.\n\n\nI \u201cjailbroke\u201d a Google Nest Mini so that you can run your own LLM\u2019s, agents and voice models.\nHere\u2019s a demo using it to manage all my messages (with help from @onbeeper)\n on, and wait for surprise guest!\nI thought hard about how to best tackle this and why, see  pic.twitter.com/rUBGoM1pO0\n Justin Alvey (@justLV) July 18, 2023\n"}

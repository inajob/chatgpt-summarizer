Wi-Fi technology lives in our smartphones, our laptops, and even our watches. Internet is available to be plucked out of the air in virtually every home across the country. Wi-Fi has been one of the grand computing revolutions of the past few decades.\nIt might surprise you to know that Australia proudly claims the invention of Wi-Fi as its own. It had good reason to, as well\u2014 given the money that would surely be due to the creators of the technology. However, dig deeper, and youll find things are altogether more complex.\n\nBig Ideas\nThe official Wi-Fi logo.\nIt all began at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or CSIRO. The government agency has a wide-ranging brief to pursue research goals across many areas. In the 1990s, this extended to research into various radio technologies, including wireless networking.\nThe CSIRO is very proud of what it achieved, crediting itself with Bringing WiFi to the world. Its a common piece of trivia thrown around the pub as a bit of national pride\u2014it was scientists Down Under that managed to cook up one of the biggest technologies of recent times!\nThis might sound a little confusing to you if youve looked into the history of Wi-Fi at all. Wasnt it the IEEE that established the working group for 802.11? And wasnt it that standard that was released to the public in 1997? Indeed, it was!\nThe fact is that many groups were working on wireless networking technology in the 1980s and 1990s. Notably, the CSIRO was among them, but it wasnt the first by any means\u2014nor was it involved with the group behind 802.11. That group formed in 1990, while the precursor to 802.11 was actually developed by NCR Corporation/ATT in a lab in the Netherlands in 1991. The first standard of what would later become Wi-Fi\u2014802.11-1997\u2014was established by the IEEE based on a proposal by Lucent and NTT, with a bitrate of just 2 MBit/s and operating at 2.4GHz. This standard operated based on frequency-hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum technology.\u00a0 This later developed into the popular 802.11b standard in 1999, which upped the speed to 11 Mbit/s. 802.11a came later, switching to 5GHz and using a modulation scheme based around orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).\nA diagram from the CSIRO patent for wireless LAN technology, dated 1993.\nGiven we apparently know who invented Wi-Fi, why are Australians allegedly taking credit? Well, it all comes down to patents. A team at the CSIRO had long been developing wireless networking technologies on its own.\u00a0 In fact, the group filed a patent on 19 November 1993 entitled Invention: A Wireless Lan.\u00a0The crux of the patent was the idea of using multicarrier modulation to get around a frustrating problem\u2014that of multipath interference in indoor environments. This was followed up with a later US patent in 1996 following along the same lines.\nThe patents were filed because the CSIRO team reckoned theyd cracked wireless networking at rates of many megabits per second. But the details differ quite significantly from the modern networking technologies we use today. Read the patents, and youll see repeated references to operating at frequencies in excess of 10 GHz. Indeed, the diagrams in the patent documents refer to transmissions in the 60 to 61 GHz range. Thats rather different from the mainstream Wi-Fi standards established by the IEEE.\u00a0The CSIRO tried over the years to find commercial partners to work with to establish its technology, however, little came of it barring a short-lived start-up called Radiata that was swallowed up by Cisco, never to be seen again.\n\nSteve Jobs shocked the crowd with a demonstration of the first mainstream laptop with wireless networking in 1999. Funnily enough, the CSIRO name didnt come up.\nBased on the fact that the CSIRO wasnt in the 802.11 working group, and that its patents dont correspond to the frequencies or specific technologies used in Wi-Fi, you might assume that the CSIRO wouldnt have any right to claim the invention of Wi-Fi. And yet, the agencys website could very much give you that impression! So whats going on?\nThe CSIRO had been working on wireless LAN technology at the same time as everyone else. It had, by and large, failed to directly commercialize anything it had developed. However, the agency still had its patents. Thus, in the 2000s, it contested that it effectively held the rights to the techniques developed for effective wireless networking, and that those techniques were used in Wi-Fi standards. After writing to multiple companies demanding payment, it came up short. The CSIRO started taking wireless networking companies to court, charging that various companies had violated its patents and demanding heavy royalties, up to $4 per device in some cases. It contested that its scientists had come up with a unique combination of OFDM multiplexing, forward error correction, and interleaving that was key to making wireless networking practical.\nAn excerpt from the CSIROs Australian patent filing in 1993. The agencys 1996 US patent covers much of the same ground.\nA first test case against a Japanese company called Buffalo Technology went the CSIROs way. A follow-up case in 2009 aimed at a group of 14 companies. After four days of testimony, the case would have gone down to a jury decision, many members of which would not have been particularly well educated on the finer points of radio communications. The matter was instead settled for $205 million in the CSIROs favor. 2012 saw the Australian group go again, taking on a group of nine companies including T-Mobile, ATT, Lenovo, and Broadcom. This case ended in a further $229 million settlement paid to the CSIRO.\nWe know little about what went on in these cases, nor the negotiations involved. Transcripts from the short-lived 2009 case had defence lawyers pointing out that the modulation techniques used in the Wi-Fi standards had been around for decades prior to the CSIROs later wireless LAN patent.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the CSIRO stuck to its guns, claiming that it was the combination of techniques that made wireless LAN possible, and that it deserved fair recompense for the use of its patented techniques.\nWas this valid? Well, to a degree, thats how patents work. If you patent an idea, and its deemed unique and special, you can generally demand a payment others that like to use it. For better or worse, the CSIRO was granted a US patent for its combination of techniques to do wireless networking. Other companies may have come to similar conclusions on their own, but that didnt get a patent for it and that left them open to very expensive litigation from the CSIRO.\nHowever, theres a big caveat here. None of this means that the CSIRO invented Wi-Fi.\u00a0These days, the agencys website is careful with the wording, noting that it invented Wireless LAN.\nThe CSIRO has published several comics about the history of Wi-Fi, which might confuse some as to the agencys role in the standard. This paragraph is a more reserved explanation, though it accuses other companies of having less success\u2014a bold statement given that 802.11 was commercially successful, and the CSIROs 60 GHz ideas werent.

The problem is that in the mass media, this has commonly been transliterated to say that the agency invented Wi-Fi, which it obviously did not. Of course, this misconception doesnt hurt the agencys public profile one bit.\nUltimately, the CSIRO did file some patents. It did come up with\u00a0a wireless networking technique in the 1990s. But did it invent Wi-Fi? Certainly not. And many will contest that the agencys patent should not have earned it any money from equipment built to standards it had no role in developing. Still, the myth with persist for some time to come. At least until someone writes a New York Times bestseller on the true and exact history of the real Wi-Fi standards. Cant wait."}

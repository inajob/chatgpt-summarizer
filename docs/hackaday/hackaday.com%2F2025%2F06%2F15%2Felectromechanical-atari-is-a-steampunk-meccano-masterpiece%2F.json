Meccano Martian Mission is an homage to Ataris 1978 Lunar Lander video game, but entirely electromechanical and made of you guessed it Meccano.\n\nYou might think Meccano is too modern to count as steampunk, but it squeaks just into the Victorian era. The first sets hit stores in 1901, the last year of Queen Victorias long reign. Since then, Meccano has developed a large following that has produced some truly impressive constructions, and this arcade game can stand amongst the best of them.\nThe game has all the features of the original: a swiveling spaceship, two-axis speed control, and even a little yellow flame that pops out when you are applying thrust. Theres a timer and a fuel gauge, and just like the original, there are easier and harder landing pads that offer score multipliers. While the score must be totted up manually, the game will detect a crash and flag it with a pop-down banner. It really has to be seen to be believed. Its all done with cams and differentials hitting potentiometers and microswitches  not an Arduino in sight; [Pete] does a good job explaining it in the second half of the embedded video, starting about 10 minutes in.\nThe brains of the operation: cams and gears, and ingenuity.\nSure, might not be new or groundbreaking  these are old, old techniques  but not many people know them well enough to use them anymore, especially not with this degree of sophistication. To see these electromechanical techniques applied anachronistically to replicate one of the great pioneers of the arcade world tickles our fancy. Its no wonder that perfecting this mechanical marvel has taken [Pete Wood] a decade.\nThe project reminds us of the Meccano Pinball Machine featured here years ago, but that somehow felt like a more natural fit for the apparently undead building kits. We lamented Meccanos demise in 2023,but the brand is apparently being revived this year. Hopefully, that means there can be more young members for the [London Meccano Club] and groups like them, to keep the perforated-steel flame alive through another six reigns.\nThis hack is the bees knees, and were very thankful to [Tim Surtell] for the tip. Remember, the tip line is always open!.\n", "title": "- \u30e1\u30ab\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u300c\u706b\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\uff1a\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "Meccano\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cMeccano Martian Mission\u300d\u306f\u3001\u65e7\u5f0f\u6280\u8853\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e1\u30ab\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u300c\u706b\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\uff1a\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- \u30d3\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u624b\u52d5\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u96c6\u8a08\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30e1\u30ab\u30ce\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5fdc\u7528\u3057\u305f\u3001\u30e1\u30ab\u30ce\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6708\u9762\u7740\u9678\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30e1\u30ab\u30ce\u306e\u518d\u751f\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u62c5\u3046\u82e5\u8005\u305f\u3061"]}

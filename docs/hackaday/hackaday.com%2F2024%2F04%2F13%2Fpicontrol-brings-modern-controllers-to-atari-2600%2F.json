Looking a bit farther down the road the project is aiming to support the Nintendo Entertainment System, and theres work being done to bring the Switch Pro Controller into the fold as well.\n\nBuilding your own version is about as easy as it gets. You need to get your hands on the appropriate 9-pin connector, which can be bought new or salvaged from an old controller, and solder it up to a Raspberry Pi Pico W.\nThese old-school digital controllers were extremely simplistic, with each pin in the connector corresponding to either a joystick direction or a button press. From the Pico side, that means virtually pressing a button on the controller is as simple as bringing the corresponding pin high. To complete the project, [Paul Taylor] designed a 3D printable enclosure that hides away the Pi Pico and all those solder joints.\nSimple and effective. While we do enjoy diving into the big and complex builds, the easy route certainly has its appeal. Weve seen NES controllers grafted to the 2600 before, but you could argue thats not really an improvement."}

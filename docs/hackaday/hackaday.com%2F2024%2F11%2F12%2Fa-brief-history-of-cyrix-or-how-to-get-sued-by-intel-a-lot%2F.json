Even though Cyrix played by the rules of licensing agreements, Intel would keep suing Cyrix repeatedly since the 1980s well into 1990s, for a total of seventeen times until Cyrix counter-sued for patent violations in May of 1997.\nThis case was settled between Cyrix and Intel, with a cross-licensing agreement established. Unfortunately these mounting legal costs and the stresses of keeping up with the competition (i.e. Intel) was proving too much and Cyrix was sold off to National Semiconductor, who wasnt enthusiastic about competing with Intel. After this Cyrix got split up into Geode (sold to AMD) and Cyrix Technologies (sold to VIA). Interestingly, VIAs x86 patent licenses and patents ended up being the foundation of Zhaoxin: a joint venture between VIA and Shanghais government which produces x86 CPUs for primarily the Chinese market.\nWe looked at the Cyrix Cx486DLC processor a while ago, and why their 386 upgrade options were perhaps not that great. Their later CPUs have however left a strong legacy that seems to endure in some way to this day.", "title": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u4f01\u696d\u304c\u5927\u624bIntel\u306b\u6311\u3093\u3060\u9053\u306e\u308a", "body": "Cyrix\u306f\u512a\u308c\u305fCPU\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001Intel\u3068\u306e\u8a34\u8a1f\u306b\u82e6\u3057\u307f\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u58f2\u5374\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u4f01\u696d\u304c\u5927\u624bIntel\u306b\u6311\u3093\u3060\u9053\u306e\u308a", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30b9\u304b\u3089x86\u4e92\u63dbCPU\u3078\uff1a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u529f\u7e3e", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u5bfe\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\uff1a\u7279\u8a31\u8a34\u8a1f\u306e\u6ce2\u4e71\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u58f2\u5374\u5f8c\u306e\u904b\u547d\uff1a\u56fd\u7acb\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u3068AMD\u3078\u306e\u5206\u5272", "Zhaoxin\u306e\u8a95\u751f\uff1a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u907a\u7523\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u4e2d\u56fd\u306ex86 CPU\u5e02\u5834"]}

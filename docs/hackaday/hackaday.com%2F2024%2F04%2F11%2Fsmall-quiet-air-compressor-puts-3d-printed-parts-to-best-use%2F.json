Similarly, while a 3D printer is a fantastic tool to have, it can make you think its possible to build all the things with printed parts. Knowing when to print em and when to machine em is important, a lesson that [Diffraction Limited] has taken to heart with this semi-printed silent air compressor.\nThe key to this compressors quiet operation is a combination of its small overall size. its relatively low output, and its strategic use of plastic components, which tend to dampen vibrations. The body of the compressor and the piston arms are the largest 3D-printed parts; the design calls for keeping printed parts in compression for longer life, while the parts of the load path in tension travel through fasteners and other non-printed parts. The piston design is interesting  rather than being attached to connecting rods via wrist pins, the machined Delrin pistons are solidly attached to the piston arms. This means they have to swivel within the cylinders, which are made from short pieces of metal tubing, with piston seals designed to move up and down in grooves on the pistons to allow air to move past them. The valve bodies atop each cylinder are salvaged from another compressor.\nWhen powered by a NEMA23-frame BLDC motor via a belt drive, the compressor is remarkably quiet; not quite silent perhaps, but still impressively smooth, and capable of 150 PSI at low speeds. And as a bonus, the split crankcase makes it easy to open up and service, or just show off how it works. Weve seen a variety of 3D-printed compressors, from screw-type to Wankel, but this one really takes the prize for fit and finish.\n\nThanks for the tip, [Whye Knott]  lol."}

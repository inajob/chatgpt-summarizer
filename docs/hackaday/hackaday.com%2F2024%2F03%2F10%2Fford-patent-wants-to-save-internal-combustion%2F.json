A recent patent filing from Ford claims it can dramatically reduce emissions and, if true, the technology might give classic engines a few more years of service life, according to [CarBuzz].\nThe patent in question centers on improving the evaporative emission systems performance. The usual evaporative emission system stores fuel fumes in a carbon-filled canister. The canister absorbs fuel vapor when under high pressure. When the engine idles and pressure in the cylinder drops, the canister releases fumes, which are combusted with ordinary fuel/air mixture.\n\nHowever, these fumes tend to reduce engine performance, which is why you should only use them during idle. If the engine exceeds the canisters capacity without removing vapor, the residual gasses vent to the atmosphere.\nThe invention uses a pre-chamber that allows the engine to purge the canister more often and faster. The [Carbuzz] post claims this will improve efficiency, reduce emissions, and reduce carbon deposits on valves.\nOf course, there are two big questions: will this be practical at scale production, and how effective will it be? We arent sure we could answer either of those questions, especially from arcane patent language.\nEngines are an amazing bit of tech and even more complicated now that we care about emissions. The tiny ones are especially awe-inspiring. Then again, if you build your engines with Lego, emissions arent really a problem."}

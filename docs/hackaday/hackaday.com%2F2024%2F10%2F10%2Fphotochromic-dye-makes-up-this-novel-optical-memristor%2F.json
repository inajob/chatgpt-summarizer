The mem part of their name seems to be the important bit, implying a memory function, but the rest of the definition seems somewhat negotiable  enough so that you can make a memristor from a bit of photochromic dye.\nNow, well leave the discussion of whether [Markus Bindhammer]s rather complex optical memory cell officially counts as a memristor to the comments below, and just go through the technical details here. The heart of this experimental device is a photochromic dye known as cis-1,2-dicyano-1,2-bis(2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thienyl)ethene, mercifully shortened to CMTE, which has the useful property of having two stable states. Transitioning from the open state to the closed state occurs when UV light shines upon it, while switching back to the closed state is accomplished with a pulse of green light. Absent the proper wavelength of light, both states are stable, making non-volatile information storage possible.\nTo accomplish this trick, [Markus] filled a quartz cuvette with a little CMTE-doped epoxy resin. Inside a light-tight enclosure, two lasers  one at 405 nm wavelength, the other at 532 nm  are trained on the cuvette through a dichroic mirror. On the other side of the CMTE resin, he placed a VEML7700 high-accuracy ambient light sensor. An Arduino Nano reads the light sensor and controls the lasers. Writing and erasing are accomplished by turning on the proper laser for a short amount of time; reading the state of the cell involves a carefully timed pulse from the 405 nm laser followed by a 532 nm pulse and watching the output of the sensor.\nIs a one-bit memory device that uses a dye that goes for \u20ac300 per gram and a pair of laser diodes practical? Of course not, but its still pretty cool, and we appreciate all the effort and expense [Markus] went to with this one. Now, if you want some fuel for the Its not a memristor fire, memristors might not even be a thing.\n\n", "title": "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c0\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u975e\u63ee\u767a\u6027\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "body": "memristor\u306f\u8a18\u61b6\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3001photochromic dye\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u5149\u3067\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u53ef\u80fd\u3002Markus Bindhammer\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u3068Arduino Nano\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002memristor\u306e\u8b70\u8ad6\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6280\u8853\u7684\u306b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c0\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u975e\u63ee\u767a\u6027\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "Arduino Nano\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5149\u5b66\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8a73\u7d30\u306b\u8feb\u308b\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c0\u30a4\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

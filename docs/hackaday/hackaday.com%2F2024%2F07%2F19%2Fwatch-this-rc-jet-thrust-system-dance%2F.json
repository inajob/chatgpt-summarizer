Speaking of control surfaces, you may notice that test aircraft lacks a rudder. That function is taken over by changing the EDFs thrust, although it still has ailerons that move in sync with the thrust system.\nEDF-powered aircraft werent really feasible in the RC scene until modern brushless electric motors combined with the power density of lithium-ion cells changed all that. And with electronics driving so much, and technology like 3D printers making one-off hardware accessible to all, the RC scene continues to be fertile ground for all sorts of fascinating experimentation. Whether its slapping an afterburner on an EDF or putting an actual micro jet engine on an RC car.\n\n\n"}

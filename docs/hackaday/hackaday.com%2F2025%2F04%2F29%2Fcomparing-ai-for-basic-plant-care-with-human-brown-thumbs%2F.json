(Credit: [Liam])Like so many of us, [Liam] has a big problem. Whether its the curse of Brown Thumbs or something else, those darn houseplants just keep dying despite guides always telling you how\u00a0incredibly easy it is to keep them from wilting with a modicum of care each day, even without opting for succulents or cactuses. In a fit of despair [Liam] decided to pin his hopes on what we have come to accept as the Savior of Humankind, namely AI, which can stand for a lot of things, but its definitely really smart and can even generate pretty pictures, which is something that the average human can not. Hence its time to let an LLM do all the smart plant caring stuff with PlantMom.\nSince LLMs (so far) dont come with physical appendages by default, some hardware had to be plugged together to measure parameters like light, temperature and soil moisture. Add to this a grow light  a water pump and all that remained was to tell the LMM using an extensive prompt (containing Python code) what it should do (keep the plant alive) and what responses (Python methods) are available. All that was left now was to let the AI (Googles Gemma 3) handle it.\nTo say that this resulted in a dramatic failure along with what reads like an emotional breakdown (on the side of the LLM) would be an understatement. The LLM insisted on turning the grow light on when it should be off and had the most erratic watering responses imaginable based on absolutely incorrect interpretations of the ADC data (flipping dry vs wet). After this episode the poor chili plants soil was absolutely saturated and is still trying to dry out, while the ongoing LLM experiment (with empty water tank) has the grow light blasting more often than a weed farm.\nSo far it seems like that the humble state machines job is still safe from being taken over by AI, and not even brown thumb folk can kill plants this efficiently."}

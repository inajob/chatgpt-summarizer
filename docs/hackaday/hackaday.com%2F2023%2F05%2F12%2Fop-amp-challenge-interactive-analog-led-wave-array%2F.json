After sitting on the idea for a few years, it was time to make it a reality, and the result is an entry into the Op-Amp Challenge.\nUnlike many similar interactive LED matrix displays that are digital in nature (because its a lot easier), this design is pure analog, using many, many op-amps. A custom PCB houses a 44 array of compute units, each with a blue and white LED indicating the sign and magnitude of the local signal.\nThe local input signal is provided by an IR photodiode, AC coupled to only respond to change, with every other circuit sharing a sensor to keep it simple. Each circuit is connected to its immediate neighbors on the PCB, and off the PCB via board-to-board connectors. This simple scheme makes this easily scalable if desired in the future.\n[Chris] does a great job of breaking down the math involved, which makes this project a neat illustration of how op-amp circuits can implement complex mathematical problems in an easy-to-understand process. Even more op-amps are pressed into service for generating the split-rail voltage reference and for amplifying the weak photodiode signals, but the computation circuit is the star of the show.\nWe like analog computing a fair bit around these parts. Heres a little something we were previously drooling over.\n\n\n \n\n"}

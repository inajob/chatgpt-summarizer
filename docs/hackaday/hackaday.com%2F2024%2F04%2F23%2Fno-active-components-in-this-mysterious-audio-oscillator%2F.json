Theres the 555, of course, and we can think of a few designs using just two transistors or even a few with just one. But how about an oscillator with no active components? Now theres a neat trick.\nReplicating [Stelian]s simplest audio oscillator on the Internet might take some doing on your part, since it relies on finding an old telephone. Like, really old  youll need one with the carbon granule cartridge in the handset, along with the speaker. Other than that, all youll need is a couple of 1.5-volt batteries, wiring everything in one big series loop, and placing the microphone and speaker right on top of each other. Apply power and youre off to the races. [Stelian]s specific setup yielded a 2.4-kHz tone that could be altered a bit by repositioning the speaker relative to the mic. On the oscilloscope, the waveform is a pretty heavily distorted sine wave.\nIts a bit of a mystery to [Stelian] as to how this works without something to provide at least a little gain. Perhaps the enclosure of the speaker or the mic has a paraboloid shape that amplifies the sound just enough to kick things off? Bah, who knows? Let the hand-waving begin!\n\n"}

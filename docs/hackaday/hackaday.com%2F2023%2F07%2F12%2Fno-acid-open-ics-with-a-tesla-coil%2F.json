Typically, youll heat the part and use fuming nitric acid (nasty stuff) in a cavity milled into the part to remove the epoxy over the die. While [100dollarhacker] doesnt provide much detail, he appears to have used a Tesla coil to do it  no hot acid required.\nInitial results were promising but took a long time to work. In addition, the coil gets very hot, and there is a chance of flames. The next attempt used a 3D printed cone with a fan to push the plasma over the chip. The first attempt shorted something out, and so far, each attempt eventually burns out the MOSFET driver.\nWe are always interested in the practical uses of Tesla coils and whats inside ICs, so this project naturally appealed to us. We hope to see more success reported on the Hackaday.io page soon. Meanwhile, if you have a coil and an old IC lying around, try it. Maybe youll figure out how to make it work well and if you do, let us know.\nThe easiest chips to open are ceramic packages with a gold lid. Just use a hobby knife. There are less noxious chemicals you can use. If you want to use fuming nitric, be sure you know what you are doing and maybe make some yourself.", "title": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066IC\u306e\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3092\u9664\u53bb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "IC\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u3068\u304d\u306f\u3001\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u3089\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u9178\u85ac\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u521d\u306e\u8a66\u884c\u3067\u306f\u3046\u307e\u304f\u3044\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u8a66\u884c\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u6210\u529f\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3084IC\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u84cb\u306e\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u958b\u304f\u306e\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066IC\u306e\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3092\u9664\u53bb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066IC\u3092\u958b\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5", "IC\u3092\u958b\u304f\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306eIC\u3092\u958b\u5c01\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "IC\u958b\u5c01\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8cea\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308b"]}

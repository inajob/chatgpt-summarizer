Most would put the Internet Archive in the category of the library\u2014with its aim of preserving and providing knowledge for the aid of all who might call on it. Sadly, as [theresnotime] reports, it appears this grand institution has been hacked.\nOn Wednesday, users visiting the Internet Archive were greeted with a foreboding popup that stated the following:\nHave you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!\nThe quote appears to refer to Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), a site that collates details of security breaches so individuals can check if their details have been compromised.\nAccording to founder Brewster Kahle, the site was apparently DDOSd, with the site defaced via a JavaScript library. Its believed this may have been a polyfill supply chain attack. As for the meat of the hack, it appears the individuals involved made off with usernames, emails, and encrypted and salted passwords. Meanwhile, as Wired reports, it appears Have I Been Pwned first received the stolen data of 31 million users on September 30.\nAt the time of writing, it appears the Internet Archive has restored the website to some degree of normal operation. Its sad to see one of the Internets most useful and humble institutions fall victim to a hack like this one. As is always the way, no connected machine is ever truly safe, no matter how much we might hope thats not the case.\n[Thanks to Sammy for the tip!]"}

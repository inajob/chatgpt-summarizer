In 1985, though, the C5 was so far out there that it became a notorious failure. The C5 retains a huge following among enthusiasts, though, and among those is [JSON Alexander, who has bought one and restored it.\nWere treated to a teardown and frank examination of the vehicles strengths and weaknesses, during which we see the Sinclair brand unusually on a set of tyres, and the original motor, which is surprisingly more efficient than expected. Sir Clive may be gone, but this C5 will live again.\nWeve had the chance to road test a C5 in the past, and its fair to say that we can understand why such a low-down riding position was not a success back in the day. Its unusual to see one in as original a condition as this one, its more usual to see a C5 thats had a few upgrades."}

(Credit: The Stock Pot, YouTube)\nRecently [Dillan Stock] over at\u00a0The Stock Pot YouTube channel bought a $17 mushroom lamp from his local Kmart that listed USB-C rechargeable as one of its features, the only problem being that although this is technically true, theres a major asterisk. This Inaya-branded lamp namely comes with a USB-C cable with a rather prominent label attached to it that tells you that this lamp requires that specific cable. After trying with a regular USB-C cable, [Dillan] indeed confirmed that the lamp does not charge from a standard USB-C cable. So he did what any reasonable person would do: he bought a second unit and set about to hacking it.\n[Dillan] also dug more into whats so unusual about this cable and the connector inside the lamp. As it turns out, while GND  Vcc are connected as normal, the two data lines (D+, D-) are also connected to Vcc. Presumably on the lamp side this is the expected configuration, while using a regular USB-C cable causes issues. Vice versa, this cables configuration may actually be harmful to compliant USB-C devices, though [Dillan] did not try this.\nWith the second unit in hand, he then started hacking it, with the full plans and schematic available on his website.\nThe changes include a regular USB-C port for charging, an ESP32 board with integrated battery charger for the 18650 Li-ion cell of the lamp, and an N-channel MOSFET to switch the power to the lamps LED. With all of the raw power from the ESP32 available, the two lamps got integrated into the Home Assistant network which enables features such as turning the lamps on when the alarm goes off in the morning. All of this took about $7 in parts and a few hours of work.\nAlthough we can commend [Dillan] on this creative hack rather than returning the item, its worrying that apparently theres now a flood of USB C-powered devices out there that come with non-compliant cables that are somehow worse than power-only USB cables. It brings back fond memories of hunting down proprietary charging cables, which was the issue that USB power was supposed to fix.\n\n", "title": "USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7406\u7531", "body": "USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u304d\u306e\u3053\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306f\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u306eUSB-C\u3067\u306f\u5145\u96fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u6539\u9020\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u56f3\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["USB-C\u5145\u96fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7406\u7531", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\uff1aESP32\u5c0e\u5165\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u6539\u9020\uff01USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u518d\u8a2d\u8a08\u624b\u9806", "\u975e\u6e96\u62e0\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\uff1aUSB-C\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u554f\u984c", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3057\u305fDIY\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5"]}

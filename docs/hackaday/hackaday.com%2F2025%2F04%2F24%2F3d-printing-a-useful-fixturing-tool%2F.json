[Chris Borge] learned this the hard way on a recent mass-production project, and decided to solve the problem. How? With a custom fixturing tool! A 3D printed one, of course.\nChriss build is simple enough. He created 3D-printed workplates covered in a grid of specially-shaped apertures, each of which can hold a single bolt. Plastic fixtures can then be slotted into the grid, and fastened in place with nuts that thread onto the bolts inserted in the base. [Chris] can 3D print all kinds of different plastic fixtures to mount on to the grid, so its an incredibly flexible system.\n3D printing fixtures might not sound the stoutest way to go, but its perfectly cromulent for some tasks. Indeed, for [Chris]s use case of laser cutting, the 3D printed fixtures are more than strong enough, since the forces involved are minimal. Furthermore, [Chris] aided the stability of the 3D-printed workplate by mounting it on a laser-cut wooden frame filled with concrete. Hows that for completeness?\nWeve seen some other great fixturing tools before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5f37\u307f", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5177\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002\u67d4\u8edf\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u3082\u5341\u5206\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5f37\u307f", "- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u56fa\u5b9a\u304c\u9375\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u591a\u7528\u9014\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u696d\u52b9\u7387\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

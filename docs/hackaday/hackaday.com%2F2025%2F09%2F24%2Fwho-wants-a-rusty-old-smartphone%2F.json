If were talking about Rust the programming language, well, that might be a different story. Google agrees, and is working on bringing the language into Android. Thats not enough for [Paul Sanja], who has the first Redox OS smartphone.\nIts alive!\nRedox OS is a Unix-like operating system written entirely in Rust, and somehow we havent covered it until now. Unlike Asterinas, a project to recreate the Linux kernel in Rust, Redox has few pretensions of being anything but its own thing, and thats great! On desktop, Redox has a working windowing system and many utilities, including a basic browser in the form of NetSurf.\nIts claims to be source-compatible with Linux and BSD programs, and partially POSIX compliant. A certain someone around here might want to try it as a daily driver. The header image is a desktop screenshot, because theres more to see there and it fits our aspect ratio.\nOn smartphones, it boots. Some smartphones, anyway. Its actually a big first step. That booting is possible is actually thanks to the great work put in by the Postmarket OS team to get Uboot working on select android devices. That uboot loader doesnt need to load the Linux-based Postmarket OS. It can be used for anything compatible. Like, say, Redox OS, as [Paul] shows us.\nOf course, Redox OS has no drivers for the touchscreen or anything else, so at the moment that rusty smartphone can only boot to a login screen. But thanks to Rust, you can rest assured that login screen hasnt got any memory leaks! Jokes aside, this is a great start and were hoping to see more.\nRedox is a promising project on mobile or desktop, and its development seems a much better use of time and effort than fighting over Rust in the Linux kernel.", "title": "\u300cRedox OS: Rust\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044Unix\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306aOS\u300d", "body": "Redox OS\u306fRust\u3067\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u305fUnix\u7cfbOS\u3067\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u3082\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRedox OS: Rust\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044Unix\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u306aOS\u300d", "\u300c\u521d\u306eRedox OS\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u304c\u8d77\u52d5\uff01\u305d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u306f\u300d", "\u300cRust\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fRedox OS\u306e\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u74b0\u5883\u300d", "\u300cRedox OS\u3001Linux\u3084BSD\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u306eRedox OS\u306e\u8d77\u52d5\u3001\u305d\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u300d"]}

This is especially true for amateur radio homebrewers  you really have to know what youre doing to stuff a complete radio in a tiny tin. But when you can build an entire 80-meter transceiver in a matchbox, thats a whole other level of DIY prowess.\nIts no surprise that this one comes to us from [Helge Fykse (LA6NCA)], who has used the aforementioned Altoids tin to build an impressive range of spy radios in both vacuum tube and solid-state versions. He wisely chose solid-state for the matchbox version of the transceiver, using just three transistors and a dual op-amp in a DIP-8 package. Theres also an RF mixer in an SMD package; [Helge] doesnt specify the parts, but it looks like it might be from Mini-Circuits. Everything is mounted dead bug style on tiny pieces of copper-clad board that get soldered to a board just the right size to fit in a matchbox.\nA 9 volt battery, riding in a separate matchbox, powers the rig. As do the earbud and tiny Morse key. That doesnt detract from the build at all, and neither does the fact that the half-wave dipole antenna is disguised as a roll of fishing line. [Helge]s demo of the radio is impressive too. The antenna is set up very low to the ground to take advantage of near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) propagation, which tends to direct signals straight up into the ionosphere and scatter them almost directly back down. This allows for medium-range contacts like [Helge]s 239 km contact in the video below.\nBanging out Morse with no sidetone was a challenge, but its a small price to pay for such a cool build. Were not sure how much smaller [Helge] can go, but were eager to see him try.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u7bb1\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e80m\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Altoids\u7f36\u306f\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5316\u306e\u8155\u3092\u62ab\u9732\u3057\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u7406\u60f3\u306e\u7b50\u4f53\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5bb6\u306b\u3082\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Helge Fykse(LA6NCA)\u306fAltoids\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30f4\u30a1\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u7ba1\u3068\u56fa\u4f53\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30b9\u30eb\u7de8\u6210\u30849V\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u7bb1\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e80m\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "Altoids\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306eDIY", "\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30d0\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u7bb1\u306b\u53ce\u7d0d", "\u30a4\u30aa\u30ce\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u7f6e", "\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u7bb1\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3067Morse\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080"]}

Go and get yours while they\u2019re still hot. True-Believer Tickets are half-price at $148 (plus fees), and when that pile of 100 is gone, regular admission is $296 (plus fees).\nCome join us on November 1st-3rd in sunny Pasadena, CA, for three days of talks, demos, badge hacking, workshops, and the sort of miscellaneous hardware shenanigans that make Hackaday Hackaday! If you\u2019ve never been to a Supercon, now is the best time to check that off your bucket list. And if you\u2019re a seven-time veteran, we\u2019re stoked to see you again. Supercon is like a year\u2019s worth of posts in one weekend. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\nFriday, November 1st, is our chill-out day. You can roll in as soon as the doors open in the morning, get your badge and some bagels, and get down to hacking. Or you can start socializing early. Or, as it almost always happens, both at once. We\u2019ll have food and music and even a few workshops, but for the most part, Fridays are what you all make of them. And we love it that way.\nTalks start up on Saturday on both stages, along with the soldering contest and an alley full of hackers. We\u2019ll close out the evening with a special celebration, but more on that in a minute.\nOn Sunday, in addition to the usual slate of talks, we\u2019ve set aside a big block of time for Lightning Talks. These are seven-minute quickies where you get to tell the bigger Hackaday community what you\u2019re up to. A short talk like this forces you to condense the story down to its essence while giving tons of people their fifteen minutes of fame in half the time! If you\u2019ve got a Lightning Talk that you\u2019d like to present, let us know! We\u2019ll try to fit in everyone we can.\nWrapping up Sunday evening, we\u2019ll give you a chance to show off whatever badge hacks you\u2019ve been working on over the weekend. We love the badge hacking demo because it allows us to see a wide (and wild) range of projects, all of which were put together in record time. Whether funny, flashy, or phenomenal, we want to see what you\u2019ve been up to.\nSupercon Add-Ons\nIt\u2019s still way too early to let the badge cat out of the bag, but we\u2019ll give you a clue. This year centers around the shitty Supercon Add-On. We want you to make your own fun badgelets to show off and share, so we\u2019re offering three special prizes and much limited-edition schwag for honorable mentions.\nDeLorean, by [realanimationxp]But more than a contest, designing your own Supercon Add-On is an invitation to get creative, get clever, or even just to get your first-ever PCB project made. There\u2019s nothing simpler than an SAO \u2013 you\u2019re talking six pins, a small board, and the rest is up to you. With a snazzy board outline and some good artwork, even a couple of LEDs can make a weekend\u2019s work look like a million dollars.\nOr, if you want to make it more interesting, the six-pin SAO standard has both I2C lines and a pair of GPIO pins, and we don\u2019t see those taken advantage of nearly enough in the wild. If you\u2019re already onto your second or third SAO design, why don\u2019t you pay attention to the connectivity in this design?\nNext week, we\u2019ll release the full specs, rules, and regulations. Until then, start brainstorming up six-pin SAO designs. Again, we\u2019re not saying that you\u2019ll need to make use of the I2C pins, but we\u2019re saying that we\u2019ll be running some tutorial articles about SAO design in the very near future. Here\u2019s [Arya]\u2019s SAO design primer from two Supercons past if you want to get a head start.\nCome Join Us!\nIf you are Hackaday, you really want to make it to Supercon if you can, and we want to see you there. You\u2019re all a great crowd, and the small size and relaxed venue makes for about the highest signal-to-noise ratio around! We\u2019ll be releasing the schedule as it firms up over the next couple weeks, and until then, you have a chance to get a discount ticket if you move quickly.

Make It Smart Quarters With This LCARS Dashboard", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2026/01/11/smart-home-make-it-smart-quarters-with-this-lcars-dashboard/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LCARS-smarthome-tablet1.webp", "original_content": "At the risk of starting a controversy: is there anyone who goes to the effort of setting up Home Assistant who wouldnt really rather be living on the Enterprise-D? If such a person exists, its not [steve-gibbs5], who has not only put together a convincing LCARS dashboard on an Android tablet, but has also put together an easy-to-follow Instructable so you can too.\n\nIn case youve been monkishly avoiding television since the mid-1980s, LCARS is the high-tech touchscreen interface used on Star Trek: The Next Generation and its sequels. Its an iconic, instantly-recognizable aesthetic, and we think [Steve] nailed it, even if he was taking design cues from Voyager,\u00a0which is not everyones favorite trek, to put it mildly. Though perhaps the haters are looking back on it a bit more fondly when compared to some more modern adaptations. Check it out in action in the video embedded below.\nThe secret to getting your Android tablet looking like a 24th-century terminal is an application called Total Launcher, which allows one to customize ones homescreen to a very high degree. [Steve] shows us how he styled Total Launcher, but that custom home screen isnt enough on its own. Those futuristic buttons need to do something, which is where a second app called Tasker comes in. Tasks in Tasker are linked to the LCARS interface and the smart home features  in [Steve]s case, Amazon Alexa, but it looks like Googles spyware or the open-source Home Assistant are equally viable options.\nWe saw Star Trek style on Raspberry Pi back in the day, but nothing says your smart home has to be Trek-themed. You could even control it via a dumb terminal if thats more your style.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "Home Assistant\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u671b\u3080\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u3002Steve\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305fLCARS\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- Android\u30bf\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3067LCARS\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Total Launcher\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u753b\u9762\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- Tasker\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u309224\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u7aef\u672b\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u5922\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u6cd5"]}

Make It Smart Quarters With This LCARS Dashboard", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2026/01/11/smart-home-make-it-smart-quarters-with-this-lcars-dashboard/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LCARS-smarthome-tablet1.webp", "original_content": "At the risk of starting a controversy: is there anyone who goes to the effort of setting up Home Assistant who wouldnt really rather be living on the Enterprise-D? If such a person exists, its not [steve-gibbs5], who has not only put together a convincing LCARS dashboard on an Android tablet, but has also put together an easy-to-follow Instructable so you can too.\n\nIn case youve been monkishly avoiding television since the mid-1980s, LCARS is the high-tech touchscreen interface used on Star Trek: The Next Generation and its sequels. Its an iconic, instantly-recognizable aesthetic, and we think [Steve] nailed it, even if he was taking design cues from Voyager,\u00a0which is not everyones favorite trek, to put it mildly. Though perhaps the haters are looking back on it a bit more fondly when compared to some more modern adaptations. Check it out in action in the video embedded below.\nThe secret to getting your Android tablet looking like a 24th-century terminal is an application called Total Launcher, which allows one to customize ones homescreen to a very high degree. [Steve] shows us how he styled Total Launcher, but that custom home screen isnt enough on its own. Those futuristic buttons need to do something, which is where a second app called Tasker comes in. Tasks in Tasker are linked to the LCARS interface and the smart home features  in [Steve]s case, Amazon Alexa, but it looks like Googles spyware or the open-source Home Assistant are equally viable options.\nWe saw Star Trek style on Raspberry Pi back in the day, but nothing says your smart home has to be Trek-themed. You could even control it via a dumb terminal if thats more your style.\n<!--more-->\n"}

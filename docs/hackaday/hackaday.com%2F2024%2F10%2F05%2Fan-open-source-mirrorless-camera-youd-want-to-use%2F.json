At the simplest a Raspberry Pi and camera module can be stuck in a 3D printed case, but in that case, the difficult work of getting the drivers and electronics sorted out has already been done for you.\nAt the other end of the scale theres [Wenting Zhang]s open source mirrorless digital camera project, in which the design and construction of a full-frame CCD digital camera has been taken back to first principles. To understand the scale of this task, this process employs large teams of engineers when a camera company does it, and while its taken a few years and the software isnt perhaps as polished as your Sony or Canon, the fact its been done at all is extremely impressive.\nInside is a Kodak full-frame sensor behind the Sony E-mount lens, for which all the complex CCD timing and acquisition circuitry has been implemented. The brains of the show lie in a Xilinx Zynq ARM-and-FPGA in a stack of boards with a power board and the CCD board. The controls and battery are in a grip, and a large display is on the back of the unit.\nWe featured an earlier version of this project last year, and this version is a much better development with something like the ergonomics, control, and interface you would expect from a modern consumer camera. The screen update is still a little slow and there are doubtless many tweaks to come, but this really feels close to being a camera youd want to try. Theres an assembly video which weve placed below the break, feast your eyes on it.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3084\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304b\u3089\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0CCD\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u307e\u3067\u5e45\u5e83\u3044\u3002Xilinx Zynq ARM-and-FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u6570\u5e74\u304b\u3051\u3066\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u59cb\u52d5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0CCD\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "Xilinx Zynq ARM-and-FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

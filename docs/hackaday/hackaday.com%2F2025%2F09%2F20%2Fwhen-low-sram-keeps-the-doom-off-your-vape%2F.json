CPU-wise it would be more than capable, with a roomy 16 MB of external SPI Flash and a 323173 pixel LC touch screen display covering the other needs. It even has a vibration motor to give you some force feedback. Interestingly, this vape has a Bluetooth Low-Energy chip built-in, but this does not seem to be used by the original Aspire firmware.\nWhat [Aaron] did to still get some DOOM vapors on the device was to implement a screenshare firmware, allowing a PC to use the device as a secondary display via its USB interface. This way you can use the regular PC mouse and keyboard inputs to play DOOM, while squinting at the small screen.\nAlthough not as completely overpowered as a recent Anker charging station that [Aaron] played DOOM on, we fully expect vapes in a few years to be perfectly usable for some casual gaming, with this potentially even becoming an original manufacturers function, if it isnt already.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c35\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u5165\u624b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01DOOM\u3092\u904a\u3079\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u300cPIXO Aspire\u300d\u300d", "body": "$35\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u300cPIXO Aspire\u300d\u304cDOOM\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067PC\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c35\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u5165\u624b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01DOOM\u3092\u904a\u3079\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u300cPIXO Aspire\u300d\u300d", "- \u300cCortex-M4 MCU\u642d\u8f09\uff0164kB SRAM\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u624b\u6cd5\u300d", "- \u300cUSB\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067PC\u3068\u9023\u643a\uff01\u300cPIXO Aspire\u300d\u3092\u30bb\u30ab\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u5909\u8eab\uff1f\u672a\u6765\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u300d", "- \u300cBluetooth\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u300cPIXO Aspire\u300d\u3001\u672a\u6d3b\u7528\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01\u300d"]}

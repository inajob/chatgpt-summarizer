In his case, it is portable satellite dishes. Youve seen these. They look like a dome or maybe a hard hat on some kind of motorized base. Whats in them? What can you do with them? Watch the video below and find out.\nAs [Gabe] points out, you can often find these on the surplus market for very little money. You can sometimes find them on the side of the road for free, too. Although weve never been that lucky.\nThe video shows three generations of Winegard antennas. It shows whats inside and how to command them. Of course, the obvious use for these is as an antenna. But we also were thinking theyd make a fair motion base for something, too.\nSome of the antennas lack any limit switches. On startup, the system spins until it grinds the plastic gears to find its travel limits. We expect thats not good for the gears, but it does work. [Gabe] mentions it might be a bit of planned obsolescence, but we imagine it is more of a cost-saving measure.\nJunkyards are a frequent source for satellite gear, apparently. Dishes have lots of other uses, too.\n\n"}

But styles ebb and flow, so we dont see too many of those builds anymore. This e-ink daily calendar reminder hearkens back to those Magic Mirrors, only with a double twist of AI.\nThis project is the work of [Ilkka Turunen], and right up front well say the results are just gorgeous. A lot of that has to do with the 10.3 e-ink display used, but more with the creative use of not one but two machine learning systems. The first is ChatGPT, which [Ilkka] uses to parse the days online calendar entries and grab the most significant events to generate a prompt for DALL-E. The generated DALL-E prompt has specific instructions that guide the style of the image, which honestly is where most of the artistry lies. [Ilkka]s aesthetic choices, like suggesting that the images look like a 19th-century lithograph or a satirical comic from a turn-of-the-(last)-century newspaper. The prompt is then sent off to DALL-E for rendering, and the resulting image is displayed.\nIt has to be said that the prompts that ChatGPT generates based on the combination of [Ilkka]s aesthetic preferences and the random events of the day are strikingly complex. The chatbot really seems to be showing some imagination these days; DALL-E is no slouch either in turning those words into images.\nLike the idea of an e-ink daily reminder but prefer a less artistic presentation? This should help.\n\n"}

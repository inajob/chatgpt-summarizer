For everyone else, you probably at least know that this is a multiplayer, open world game, you may have heard that running a Minecraft server is a good job for maxing out a spare a Raspberry Pi. Which is why were hugely impressed that [PortalRunner] managed to squeeze an open world onto an ESP32-C3.\nOf course, the trick here is that the MCU isnt actually running the game  its running bareiron, [PortalRunner]s own C-based Minecraft server implementation. Rewriting the server code in C allows it to be optimized for the ESP32s hardware, but it also let [PortalRunner] strip his server down to the bare essentials, and tweak everything for performance. For example, instead of the multiple octaves of perlin noise for terrain generation, with every chunk going into RAM, hes using the x and z of the corners as seeds for the psudorandom rand() function, and interpolating between them. Instead of caves being generated by a separate algorithm (and stored in memory), in bareiron the underground is just a mirror-image of the world above. Biomes are just tiled, and sit separately from one another.\nSo yes, what you get from bareiron is simpler than a traditional Minecraft world  items are simplified, crafting is simplified, everything is simplified, but its also running on an ESP32, so youve got to give it a pass. With 200 ms to load each chunk, its playable, but the Worlds Smallest Minecraft Server is a bit like a dancing bear: its not about how well it dances, but that it dances at all.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen Minecrafts server code re-written: some masochist did it in COBOL, but at least that ran on an actual computer, not a microcontroller. Speaking of low performance, you cant play Minecraft on an SNES, but you can hide the game inside a cartridge, which is almost as good.\nThanks to [CodeAsm] for the tip. Please refer any other dancing bears spotted in the wild to our tips line.\n\n"}

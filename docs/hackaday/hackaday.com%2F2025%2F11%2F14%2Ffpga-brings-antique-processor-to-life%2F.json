The feel of the controllers and the exact timing of the original, non-emulated software provide a certain experience thats difficult or impossible to replicate otherwise. To that end, [bit-hack] wanted to play the original EGA, 16-color version of The Secret of Monkey Island in a way that faithfully recreated the original and came up with this FPGA-based PC with a real NEC V20 powering it all.\nThe early 90s-style build is based on a low-power version of the V20 called the V20HL which makes it much easier to interface with a modern 3.3 V FPGA compared to the original 5 V chip. Its still an IBM XT compatible PC though, with the FPGA tying together the retro processor to a 1 MB RAM module, a micro SD slot that acts as a hard disk drive, a digital-to-analog audio converter, and of course the PS/2 keyboard and mouse and VGA port. The mouse was one of the bigger challenges for [bit-hack] as original XT PCs of this era would have used a serial port instead.\nWith a custom PCB housed in a acrylic case, [bit-hack] has a modern looking recreation of an XT PC running an original processor and capable of using all of the period-correct peripherals that would have been used to play Monkey Island when it was first released.\nFPGAs enable a ton of retrocomputing projects across a wide swath of platforms, and if youre looking to get started the MiSTer FPGA project is a great resource.\n\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bFPGA\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306ePC", "body": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bFPGA\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306ePC\u3067\u300cMonkey Island\u300d\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bFPGA\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306ePC", "- NEC V20\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- The Secret of Monkey Island\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u69cb\u7bc9", "- 3.3V FPGA\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eV20HL\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u96fb\u529bPC\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- MiSTer FPGA\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u4e16\u754c"]}

In the video (embedded below) youll see why this tool was needed: by-hand manufacturing worked for the prototype, but really would not scale.\nTwo examples of the spring in question, embedded in the 3D printed light socket. Theres another pair you cant see.\nThe lights themselves might be worthy of a post, being a modular, open source DMX stage lighting rig. Today though were looking at how they are manufactured specifically how one part is manufactured. With these PETAL lights, the lights slot into a base station, which obviously requires a connection of some sort. [Super Valid Designs] opted for a spring connector, which is super valid.\nIts also a pain to work by hand: spring steel needed to be cut to length, hole punched, and bent into the specific shape required. The hand-made springs always needed adjustment after assembly, too, which is no good when people are giving you money for objects. Even when using a tent-pole spring that comes halfway to meeting their requirements, [Super Valid Designs] was not happy with the workflow.\nEnter the press: 3D Printed dies rest inside a spring-loaded housing, performing the required bends. Indeed, they were able to improve the shape of the design thanks to the precision afforded by the die. The cutting step happens concurrently, with the head of a pair of tin snips mounted to the jig, and a punch finishes it off. All of this is actuated with a cheap, bog simple , hand-operated arbor press. What had been tedious minutes of work is reduced to but a moment of lever-pushing.\nIt great story about scaling and manufacturing that may hopefully inspire others in their projects. Perhaps with further optimization and automation, [Super Valid Designs] may find himself in the market for a modular conveyor belt design. \nWhile this process remains fundamentally manual, we have seen automation in maker-type businesses before, like this coaster-slinging CNC setup. Of course automation doesnt have to be part of a business model; sometimes its nice just to skip a tedious bunch of steps, like when building a star lamp.\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a4\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u578b\u3092\u7528\u3044\u624b\u52d5\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a4\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- PETAL\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8131\u5374\uff1a\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u624b\u52d5\u30a2\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u7cbe\u5bc6\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u52a0\u5de5", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u88fd\u9020\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u624b\u6cd5"]}

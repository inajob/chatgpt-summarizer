They fell out of favor as more advanced display technologies became cheaper. However, if you combine an analog dial with a modern e-ink display, it turns out you get something truly fantastic indeed.\nThis build comes to us from [Arne]. The concept is simple\u2014get an e-ink display, and draw a dial on it using whatever graphics and scale you choose. Then, put it behind a traditional coil-driven analog dial in place of the more traditional paper scale. Now, you have an analog dial that can display any quantity you desire. Just update the screen to display a different scale as needed. Meanwhile, if you dont need to change the display, the e-ink display will draw zero power and still display the same thing.\n[Arne] explains how it all works in the writeup. Its basically a LilyGo T5 ESP32 board with an e-ink screen attached, and its combined with a MF-110A multimeter. Its super easy to buy that stuff and start tinkering with the concept yourself. [Arne] uses it with Home Assistant, which is as good an idea as any.\nYou get all the benefits of a redrawable display, with the wonderful visual tactility of a real analog dial. Its a build that smashes old and new together in the best way possible. It doesnt heart that [Arne] chose a great retro font for the dial, either. Applause all around!"}

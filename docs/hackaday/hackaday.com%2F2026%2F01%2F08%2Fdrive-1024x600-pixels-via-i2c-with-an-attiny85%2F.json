With just 512 bytes of RAM and 8 kilobytes of flash memory, the 8-bit micro seems a little cramped to drive, say, a 10 screen. Yet thats exactly what [ToSStudio] is doing with TinyTFT_LT7683: 1024 x 600 pixels of TFT goodness, over I2C no less.\nWith the right TFT controller, this little micro-controller can do magic.\nThe name kind of gives away the secret: it wont work on just any TFT display. Its using properties of the LT7683 display driver, though if you dont have one of those, the RA8875 is also compatible. Those drivers can take more than just a pixel stream a good thing, since youd be hard pressed to get that many pixels streaming from an ATtiny. These are character/graphic display drivers, which means you can get them to draw both characters and graphics on the screen if you speak the lingo.\nIts still not blazing fast; the documentation suggests static or moderately dynamic UIs as the suggested use case, and a clock is of the pre-programmed examples. From that, we can surmise that you can get 1 FPS or better with this code. Youre limited both by the simple micro-controller and the bandwidth of the I2C bus, but within those limits this seems like a very powerful technique.\nThis isnt the first ATtiny graphics library to blow our minds, but if you really want an impressive graphics demo from the little micro that could, you really need to race the beam.\nThanks to [Thomas Scherer] for the tip!", "title": "- ATtiny85\u3067\u306e\u5927\u753b\u9762\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "ATtiny85\u30671024x600\u306eTFT\u8868\u793a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002LT7683\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u5229\u7528\u3067\u3001\u9759\u7684UI\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u6280\u8853\u3002", "titles": ["- ATtiny85\u3067\u306e\u5927\u753b\u9762\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u65b9\u6cd5", "- TinyTFT_LT7683\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306aTFT\u8868\u793a", "- LT7683\u3068RA8875\u3067ATtiny85\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u7a81\u7834\uff01", "- \u9759\u7684\u30fb\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306eUI\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aATtiny85\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30c7\u30e2\u88fd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357"]}

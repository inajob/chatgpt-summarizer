Today\u2019s example of this adage: [Stoppi] built an atomic force microscope out of mostly junk parts and got pretty good results, considering. (Original is in German; read it translated here.)\nThe traditional AFM setup uses a piezo micromotor to raise and lower the sample into a very, very fine point. When this point deflects, it reads the height from the piezo setup and a motor stage moves on to the next point. Resolution is essentially limited by how fine a point you can make and how precisely you can read from the motion stages. Here, [stoppi]\u2019s motion stage follows the traditional hacker avenue of twin DVD sleds, but instead of a piezo motor, he bounces a laser off of a mirror on top of the point and reads the deflection with a line sensor. It\u2019s a clever and much simpler solution.\nA lot of the learnings here are in the machine build. Custom nichrome and tungsten tips are abandoned in favor of a presumably steel compass tip. The first-draft spring ended up wobbling in the X and Y directions, rather than just moving in the desired Z, so that mechanism got reinforced with aluminum blocks. And finally, the line sensors were easily swamped by the laser\u2019s brightness, so neutral density filters were added to the project.\nThe result? A nice side effect of the laser-bouncing-off-of-mirror setup is that the minimum resolvable height can be increased simply by moving the line sensors further and further away from the sample, multiplying the deflection by the baseline. Across his kitchen, [stoppi] is easily able to resolve the 35-um height of a PCB\u2019s copper pour. Not bad for junk bin parts, a point from a crafts store, and a line sensor.\nIf you want to know how far you can push a home AFM project, check out [Dan Berard]\u2019s absolutely classic hack. And once you have microscope images of every individual atom in the house, you\u2019ll, of course, want to print them out.\n"}

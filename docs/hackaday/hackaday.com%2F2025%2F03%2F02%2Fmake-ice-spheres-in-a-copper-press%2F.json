[Seth Robinson] crafted a copper ice press to make his own.\nCopper is well-known for its thermal conductivity, making it a perfect material for building a press to melt ice into a given shape. Like many projects, a combination of techniques yields the best result, and in this case we get to see 3d printing, sand casting, lost PLA casting, lathe turning, milling, and even some good old-fashioned sanding.\nThe most tedious part of the process appears to be dip coating of ceramic for the lost PLA mold, but the finished result is certainly worth it. Thats not to say that any of the process looks easy if you are a metal working novice. Taking over a week to slowly build up the layers feels a bit excruciating, especially compared to 3D printing the original plastic piece. If youre ever feeling discouraged watching someone elses awesome projects, you might want to stick around to the end when [Robinson] shows us his first ever casting. Wed say his skill has improved immensely over time.\nIf youre looking for something else to do with casting copper alloys, be sure to checkout this bronze river table or [Robinsons] copper levitation sphere.\nThanks to [DjBiohazard] for the tip!\n\n"}

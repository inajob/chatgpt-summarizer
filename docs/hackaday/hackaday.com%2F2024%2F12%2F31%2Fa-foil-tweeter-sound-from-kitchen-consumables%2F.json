That hasnt stopped plenty of engineers from trying new ways to make sound though, and [R.U.H] is here with a home-made version of one of them. Its a foil tweeter, a design in which a corrugated strip of foil is held in a magnetic field, and vibrates when an audio frequency current is passed through it.\nHe shows a couple of takes on the design, both with neodymium magnets but with different foils and 3D printed or wooden surrounds. They both make a noise when plugged into an amplifier, and unsurprisingly the thicker foil has less of the high notes.\nWe can see that in there is the possibility for a high quality tweeter, but we cant help having one concern. This device has an extremely low impedance compared to the amplifier, and thus would probably be drawing far too much current. Wed expect it to be driven through a transformer instead, if he had any care for not killing the amplifier.\nHappily there are other uses for a ribbon, they are far better known as microphones.\n\n"}

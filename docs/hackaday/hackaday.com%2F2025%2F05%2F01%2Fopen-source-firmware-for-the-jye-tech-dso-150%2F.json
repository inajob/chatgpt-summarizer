If youre really feeling the DIY ethos, you can go even further, too, and kit your scope out with the latest open source firmware.\nThe Open-DSO-150 firmware is a complete rewrite from the ground up, and packs the scope with lots of neat features. You get one analog or three digital channels, and triggers are configurable for rising, falling, or both edges on all signals. There is also a voltmeter mode, serial data dump feature, and a signal statistics display for broader analysis.\n\n\nFor the full list of features, just head over to the GitHub page. If youre planning to install it on your own DSO-150, you can build the firmware in the free STM32 version of Atollic trueSTUDIO.\nIf youre interested in the Jye Tech DSO-150 as it comes from the factory, weve published our very own review, too. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own scope hacks, dont hesitate to let us know!\nThanks to [John] for the tip!"}

Each pixel in this display is a panel of some kind, and different effects can be had by moving individual panels to different angles. Not only can images be represented, but the patterns of the movements themselves can be beautiful as well.\nThe panels are an important part of how the display presents, so the design makes them easy to change out.\nThese sorts of displays are fertile ground for artistic expression (one memorable implementation of this basic idea was the wooden mirror, which used varnished tiles of wood) but anyone looking to use the concept has usually been on their own when it comes to implementation.\nThe idea [AIRPOCKET] has is to make this kind of installation easier to implement. This method uses economical mini RC servos and 3D-printed pieces to create modular segments that can be assembled into whatever configuration one may need.\nThe material of the panels matters, too. Just below the page break, you can see a large unit with each pixel consisting of a mirrored square that reflects daylight. Theres also a video of an earlier prototype that uses some ridged two-color pieces to create a simple 44 three-level greyscale display.\nThere are a lot of possibilities if [AIRPOCKET] can make this sort of display more easily accessible, and that makes it a contender in the 2023 Hackaday Prize.\n\n\n\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

[Martin Donlon], aka [wickerwaka], is well known in retro gaming and arcade hardware reverse engineering circles and had the usual issues figuring out how an arcade CPU board worked while developing a MiSTer core. Some interesting ASICs needed quite a bit of poking, and changing the contents of socketed ERPOMs is a labour-intensive process. The solution was PicoROM, a nicely designed ROM emulator in a handy DIP-32 form factor.\nAs the title suggests, PicoROM is based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040. It emulates an 8-bit ROM up to 2MBits in size with speeds up to 100ns. Since it uses the RP2040, USB connectivity is simple, enabling rapid uploading of new images to one (or more) PicoROMs in mere seconds. A vertically orientated USB-C connector allows multiple PicoROMs to be cabled to the host without interfering with neighbouring hardware. The firmware running on core 1 passes data from the internal 264K SRAM, using the PIO block as a bus interface to the target. A neat firmware feature is the addition of a mechanism to use a ROM region as a bidirectional control channel, which the software running on the target can use to communicate back to the host computer. This allows remote triggering of actions and the reporting of responses. Responses which may not be physically observable externally. [Martin] is using this feature extensively to help probe the functionality of some special function chips on the target boards, which is still a slow process but helped massively by reducing that critical software iteration time. The PCB was designed with KiCAD. The project files foe which can be found here.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen the RP2040 used for ROM emulation; heres a pile of wires that does the same job. It just isnt as pretty. Of course, if you really must use EPROMs, then you could give this sweet programmer a look over.\n\n", "title": "\u30d4\u30b3ROM\uff1aRP2040\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30e0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "PicoROM\u306fRP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u8fc5\u901f\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u5c55\u958b\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d4\u30b3ROM\uff1aRP2040\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30e0\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u89e3\u6790\u306b\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u30d4\u30b3ROM", "USB\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067\u77ac\u6642\u306b\u753b\u50cf\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\uff01\u30d4\u30b3ROM\u306e\u5229\u4fbf\u6027", "KiCAD\u3067\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d4\u30b3ROMPCB\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u53cd\u5fa9\u6642\u9593\u3092\u77ed\u7e2e\u3059\u308b\u30d4\u30b3ROM\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

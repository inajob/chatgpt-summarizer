For radio manufacturers this can be a boon, as this group tends to have a lot of money and not demand many new features in their technology. But for those of us who skew a bit younger, there are a few radios with custom firmware available that can add a lot of extra capabilities.\nThe new firmware is developed by [NicSure] for the Tidradio TD-H3 and TD-H8 models and also includes a browser-based utility for flashing it to the radio without having to install any other utilities. Once installed, users of these handheld radios will get extras like an improved S-meter and detection and display of CTCSS tones for repeater usage. Theres also a programmer available that allows the radios memory channels to be programmed easily from a computer and a remote terminal of sorts that allows the radio to be operated from the computer.\nOne of the latest firmware upgrades also includes a feature called Ultra Graph which is a live display of the activity on a selected frequency viewable on a computer screen. With a radio like this and its upgraded firmware, a lot of the capabilities of radios that sell for hundreds of dollars more can be used on a much more inexpensive handheld. All of this is possible thanks to an on-board USB-C interface which is another feature surprisingly resisted by other manufacturers even just for charging the batteries.\n\n", "title": "- \u82e5\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u306f\u5e74\u914d\u8005\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u3060\u304c\u3001\u82e5\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b\u6700\u65b0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5f37\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u82e5\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Tidradio TD-H3\u3068TD-H8\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u7121\u6599\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30e6\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3067\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\uff01\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa"]}

However, you still have water pump noises to deal with. [Der8auer] got a Wieland prototype cooler that doesnt use a pump. Instead, it relies on the thermosiphon effect. In simple terms, the heat moves water  possibly boiling it  upwards to a radiator. Once the water is cool, it falls down back to the heat exchanger again.\nIt looks like any other AIO, but the block is extremely flat compared to normal coolers, which have the pump on top of the plate. As you might expect, orientation matters, and you cant have tight bends in the hoses. The system also has to be totally airtight to function properly. The test was meant to be against a commercial AIO unit with the same number of fans. However, there was a problem, and the final test was done with a larger radiator with one of its three fans removed.\nThe prototype performed fine and was quiet. It didnt do as well as the commercial cooler, but it wasnt bad. Of course, this is a prototype. Maybe a final product will do better. Around the ten-minute mark, the IR camera came out, and it didnt show any major unexpected hot spots.\nWeve seen water-cooled printer hotends, and pumping is a problem there. We wondered if this technology might work there. The whole thing reminded us of heat pipes without the internal wick to move cold working fluid. Weve even seen a water-cooled calculator.\n\n", "title": "\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u65b0\u578b\u6c34\u51b7\u30af\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u901a\u5e38\u30a8\u30a2\u51b7\u5374\u3088\u308a\u3082\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u826f\u304f\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u9759\u304b\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6c34\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u9a12\u97f3\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u51b7\u5374\u88c5\u7f6e\u306f\u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u305b\u305a\u3001\u51b7\u3084\u3057\u904e\u304e\u306a\u3044\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u307e\u3060\u51b7\u5374\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u65b0\u578b\u6c34\u51b7\u30af\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u6027\u3068\u9759\u97f3\u6027", "\u30c6\u30eb\u30e2\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u51b7\u30af\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u51b7\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u6c34\u51b7\u65b9\u5f0f\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

Add to that our tendency to wait until the last minute, and there still more projects out there that we\u2019d like to see. So we\u2019re extending the deadline one more week, until October 22nd.\nAND!XOR Doom SAO from years past.\nIf you\u2019re just tuning in now, well, you\u2019ve got some catching up to do. Supercon Add-Ons are another step forward in the tradition of renaming the original SAO. One of our favorite resources on the subject comes from prolific SAO designer [Twinkle Twinkie], and you can even download PCB footprints over there on Hackaday.io.\nDont know why you want to make an SAO?\u00a0 Even if youre not coming to Supercon this year? Well, our own [Tom Nardi] describes it as a low barrier to entry, full-stack hardware design and production tutorial. Plus, youll have something to trade with like-minded hardware nerds at the next con you attend.\nWe\u2019ve already seen some killer artistic entries, but we want to see yours! We know the time\u2019s tight, but you can still get in a last minute board run if you get started today. And those of you who are sitting at home waiting for boards to arrive, wipe that sweat from your brow. We\u2019ll catch up with you next Tuesday!\n \n\n", "title": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u79cb\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306bSupercon Add-On\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c\u5ef6\u9577\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059", "body": "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c10\u670822\u65e5\u306b1\u9031\u9593\u5ef6\u9577\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002SAO\u306e\u30ea\u30cd\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3084\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u5fdc\u52df\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3001SAO\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u79cb\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306bSupercon Add-On\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c\u5ef6\u9577\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059", "AND!XOR Doom SAO: \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "Supercon Add-Ons: SAO\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9032\u5316", "SAO\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u5229\u70b9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u3078\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

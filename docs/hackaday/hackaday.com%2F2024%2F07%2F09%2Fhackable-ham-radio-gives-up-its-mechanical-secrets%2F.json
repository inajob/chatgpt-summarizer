We dont get to see many mechanical reverse-engineering efforts, though, which is a pity because electronic hacks often literally dont stand on their own. Thats why these reverse-engineered mechanical diagrams of the Quansheng UV-K5 portable amateur radio transceiver really caught our eye.\nPart of the reason for the dearth of mechanical diagrams for devices, even one as electrically and computationally hackable as the UV-K5, is that mechanical diagrams are a lot less abstract than a schematic or even firmware. Luckily, this fact didnt daunt [mdlougheed] from putting a stripped-down UV-K5 under a camera for a series of images to gather the raw data needed by photogrammetry package RealityCapture. The point cloud was thoughtfully scaled to match the dimensions of the radios reverse-engineered PC board, so the two models can work together.\nThe results are pretty impressive, especially for a first effort, and should make electromechanical modifications to the radio all the easier to accomplish. Hats off to [mdlougheed] for the good work, and let the mechanical hacks begin.", "title": "\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u6a5f\u68b0\u9006\u89e3\u6790\u306e\u52aa\u529b\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002Quansheng UV-K5\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u56f3\u89e3\u3092 photogrammetry \u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8 RealityCapture \u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u96fb\u6c17\u7684\u3001\u8a08\u7b97\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u8a66\u307f\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u6b8b\u3057\u305f[mdlougheed]\u306b\u656c\u610f\u3092\u8868\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "Quansheng UV-K5\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u6539\u9020", "UV-K5\u306e\u5199\u771f\u6e2c\u91cf\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u6539\u9020"]}

What do you do? Sure, it is easy enough to plug a Raspberry Pi or some other tiny computer, but thats not always desirable from a power, space, or cost point of view. [Mellow_Labs] shows a module that makes it simple to add sound to any project. The little board is just big enough to house a speaker and doesnt cost much. Check it out in the video below.\nThe device allows you to preload tracks as MP3 files. There are two ways to control it: via a serial port, or using a single pin that can accept commands like you might expect from a MP3 player, like play and next track.\n\nThe module was loud, and the built-in speaker can be replaced. The modules documentation doesnt seem to include any example code, but [Mellow_Labs] has code for you on GitHub. It probably isnt going to win any audiophile awards, but you dont expect that from something just a little bigger than an inch across and not even a half-inch tall. Seems like a good thing for your Halloween props.\nIt isnt that we havent seen MP3 modules before, but this one is nicely integrated and complete. We wondered if a 3D-printed cone might make this a nice custom bike horn or if it would need more amplification.\n"}

What do you do? Sure, it is easy enough to plug a Raspberry Pi or some other tiny computer, but thats not always desirable from a power, space, or cost point of view. [Mellow_Labs] shows a module that makes it simple to add sound to any project. The little board is just big enough to house a speaker and doesnt cost much. Check it out in the video below.\nThe device allows you to preload tracks as MP3 files. There are two ways to control it: via a serial port, or using a single pin that can accept commands like you might expect from a MP3 player, like play and next track.\n\nThe module was loud, and the built-in speaker can be replaced. The modules documentation doesnt seem to include any example code, but [Mellow_Labs] has code for you on GitHub. It probably isnt going to win any audiophile awards, but you dont expect that from something just a little bigger than an inch across and not even a half-inch tall. Seems like a good thing for your Halloween props.\nIt isnt that we havent seen MP3 modules before, but this one is nicely integrated and complete. We wondered if a 3D-printed cone might make this a nice custom bike horn or if it would need more amplification.\n", "title": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u97f3\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u97f3\u58f0\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u97f3\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u3044\u5834\u5408\u3001[Mellow_Labs]\u306f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002MP3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u30d7\u30ea\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u307e\u305f\u306f\u5358\u4e00\u30d4\u30f3\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002GitHub\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u97f3\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "MP3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u30d7\u30ea\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u5236\u5fa1", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u97f3\u3092", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u3066\u97f3\u58f0\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0"]}

These were the first candle-based timekeeping devices, but as [Tim]\u2019s flicker-based oscillator demonstrates, they\u2019re certainly not the only way to keep time with a flame.\nGenerally speaking, modern candles minimize flickering by using a wick thats designed to balance the amount of wax and air drawn into the flame. However, when several candles are brought close together, their flames begin to interfere with each other, causing them to flicker in synchrony. The frequency of flickering is a function of gravity and flame diameter alone, so a bundle of three candles will flicker at a fairly constant frequency; in [Tim]\u2019s case, it was about 9.9 Hz.\nTo sense this oscillation, [Tim] originally used a phototransistor to detect the flame\u2019s light, but he wanted an even simpler solution. He positioned a wire just above the flame, so that as it flickered it would periodically contact the wire. A flame has a different dielectric constant than air does, so the capacitance between this and another wire wrapped around the bundle of candles fluctuates with the flame. To sense this, he used a CH32V003 microcontroller, which reads capacitance, performs some signal processing to get a clean signal, counts oscillations, and uses this time signal to blink an LED once a second. The final result is unusually mesmerizing for a blinking LED.\nIn something of the reverse of this project, we\u2019ve also seen an oscillator used for an (artificial) candle. There\u2019s also a surprising amount of science that can be learned by studying candles.\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

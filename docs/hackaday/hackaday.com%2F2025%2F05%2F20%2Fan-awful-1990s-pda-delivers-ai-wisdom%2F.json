If you were lucky you could afford a Psion, a PalmPilot, or even the famous Apple Newton  but to trap the unwary there were a slew of far less capable machines competing for market share.\n[Nick Bild] has one of these, branded Rolodex, and in a bid to make using a generative AI less alluring, hes set it up as the interface to an LLM hosted on a Raspberry Pi 400. This hack is thus mostly a tale of reverse engineering the devices serial protocol to free it from its Windows application.\nFinding the baud rate was simple enough, but the encoding scheme was unexpectedly fiddly. Sadly the device doesnt come with a terminal because these machines were very much single-purpose, but it does have a memo app that allows transfer of text files. This is the wildly inefficient medium through which the communication with the LLM happens, and it satisfies the requirement of making the process painful.\nWe see this type of PDA quite regularly in second hand shops, indeed youll find nearly identical devices from multiple manufacturers also sporting software such as dictionaries or a thesaurus. Back in the day they always seemed to be advertised in Sunday newspapers and aimed at older people. Weve never got to the bottom of who the OEM was who manufactured them, or indeed cracked one apart to find the inevitable black epoxy blob processor. If we had to place a bet though, wed guess theres an 8051 core in there somewhere.\n\n", "title": "- 1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePDA\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePDA\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u3001Rolodex\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAI\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002", "titles": ["- 1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePDA\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u306e\u53e4\u3044Rolodex\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3068\u306f\u8a00\u3048\u306a\u3044\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u624b\u6bb5", "- OEM\u306f\u8ab0\uff1f\u53e4\u3044PDA\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u8ffd\u3046"]}

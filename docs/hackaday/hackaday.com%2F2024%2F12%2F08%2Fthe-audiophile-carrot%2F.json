[Julian Krause] follows up on a Reddit meme of a carrot being used to join two phono plugs, and appears to find the organic interconnect to be of good quality.\nWe had to admit a second look at a calendar to be sure that its not April 1st, but while his manner is slightly tongue in cheek it seems hes really characterising the audio performance of a carrot. What he finds is a bit of attenuation, some bass cut, and an intrusion of RF interference pickup, but surprisingly, not a bad distortion figure.\nOf course, were guessing the real point of the exercise is to poke fun at the world of excessive hi-fi equipment, something weve been only too glad to have a go at ourselves from time to time. But if the tests are to be taken at face value it seems that in a pinch, a carrot will do as a means to hook together line level audio cables, no doubt lending a sweet and crunchy overtone to the result. The video is below the break, for your entertainment.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\uff01\u610f\u5916\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c", "body": "\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a5\u7d9a\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u3002\u97f3\u8cea\u306f\u60aa\u304f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30cf\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u6a5f\u5668\u3078\u306e\u76ae\u8089\u304b\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3050\uff01\u610f\u5916\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c", "- \u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u97f3\u8cea\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4ee3\u7528\u54c1\uff1f\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u5f79\u5272", "- \u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\u3068\u306f", "- \u9762\u767d\u5b9f\u9a13\uff01\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u304c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

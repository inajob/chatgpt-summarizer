[Julian Krause] follows up on a Reddit meme of a carrot being used to join two phono plugs, and appears to find the organic interconnect to be of good quality.\nWe had to admit a second look at a calendar to be sure that its not April 1st, but while his manner is slightly tongue in cheek it seems hes really characterising the audio performance of a carrot. What he finds is a bit of attenuation, some bass cut, and an intrusion of RF interference pickup, but surprisingly, not a bad distortion figure.\nOf course, were guessing the real point of the exercise is to poke fun at the world of excessive hi-fi equipment, something weve been only too glad to have a go at ourselves from time to time. But if the tests are to be taken at face value it seems that in a pinch, a carrot will do as a means to hook together line level audio cables, no doubt lending a sweet and crunchy overtone to the result. The video is below the break, for your entertainment.\n\n"}

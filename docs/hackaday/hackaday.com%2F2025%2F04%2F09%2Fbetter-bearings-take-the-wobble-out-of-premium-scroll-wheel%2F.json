Were supposed to be hunting and gathering, not hunting and pecking. So anything that makes the computing experience a little more pleasurable is probably worth the effort, and this premium wireless scroll wheel certainly seems to fit that bill.\nIf this input device seems familiar, thats because we featured [Engineer Bo]s first take on this back at the end of 2024. That version took a lot of work to get right, and while it delivered high-resolution scrolling with a premium look and feel, [Bo] just wasnt quite satisfied with the results. There were also a few minor quibbles, such as making the power switch a little more user-friendly and optimizing battery life, but the main problem was the one that we admit would have driven us crazy, too: the wobbling scroll wheel.\n[Bo]s first approach to the wobble problem was to fit a larger diameter bearing under the scroll wheel. That worked, but at the expense of eliminating the satisfying fidget-spinner action of the original  not acceptable. Different bearings yielded the same result until [Bo] hit on the perfect solution: a large-diameter ceramic bearing that eliminated the wobble while delivering the tactile flywheel experience.\nThe larger bearing left more room inside for the redesigned PCB and a lower-profile, machined aluminum wheel. [Bo] also had a polycarbonate wheel made, which looks great as is but would really be cool with internal LEDs  at the cost of battery life, of course. Hes also got plans for a wheel machined from wood, which well eagerly await.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9032\u5316\u300d", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u632f\u52d5\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3057\u3001\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9032\u5316\u300d", "\u300c\u60a9\u307e\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e wobble \u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u5165\u529b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300d", "\u300c\u30bf\u30af\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u300d", "\u300cLED\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30dd\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u6728\u88fd\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u672a\u6765\u300d"]}

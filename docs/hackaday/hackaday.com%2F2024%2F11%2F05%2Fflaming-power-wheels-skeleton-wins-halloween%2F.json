And so [gearscodeandfire]s Halloween project caught our eye. Its a pink Power Wheels jeep driven by a skeletal rider, and the best part is that the whole thing is remote controlled down to a pan-and-tilt skull, a first-person video feed, and even real flames.\nAt its heart is an ESP32 with a set of motor controllers and relays to do the heavy lifting. The controller is a standard radio remote controller, and the first-person view is an analogue feed as youd find on a drone. The skeleton is given a child-like appearance by discarding the original adult-proportioned plastic skull and replacing it with a much larger item. The thought that plastic Halloween skulls are available in a range of standard sizes and can be considered as a part in their own right is something we find amusing. The propane burner is supplied from a small cylinder via a solenoid valve, and ignited with the spark from a high-voltage transformer.\nThe result, we think, wins Halloween hands down. Twelve-foot skeletons are SO 2023!\nThe video is below the break.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://hackaday.io/project/199110-ghost-toddler-esp32-fpv-pan-tilt-power-wheels"}

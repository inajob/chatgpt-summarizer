And so [gearscodeandfire]s Halloween project caught our eye. Its a pink Power Wheels jeep driven by a skeletal rider, and the best part is that the whole thing is remote controlled down to a pan-and-tilt skull, a first-person video feed, and even real flames.\nAt its heart is an ESP32 with a set of motor controllers and relays to do the heavy lifting. The controller is a standard radio remote controller, and the first-person view is an analogue feed as youd find on a drone. The skeleton is given a child-like appearance by discarding the original adult-proportioned plastic skull and replacing it with a much larger item. The thought that plastic Halloween skulls are available in a range of standard sizes and can be considered as a part in their own right is something we find amusing. The propane burner is supplied from a small cylinder via a solenoid valve, and ignited with the spark from a high-voltage transformer.\nThe result, we think, wins Halloween hands down. Twelve-foot skeletons are SO 2023!\nThe video is below the break.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://hackaday.io/project/199110-ghost-toddler-esp32-fpv-pan-tilt-power-wheels", "title": "- \u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u9ab8\u9aa8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\uff01ESP32\u642d\u8f09\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u9ab8\u9aa8\u4e57\u8eca\u306e\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u708e\u3082\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u9ab8\u9aa8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\uff01ESP32\u642d\u8f09\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba", "- \u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u8996\u70b9\u306eFPV\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u8feb\u308b\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u6050\u6016", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u708e\u3092\u6f14\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u9ab8\u9aa8\u30b8\u30fc\u30d7", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u9055\u3044\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u9ab8\u9aa8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "- Halloween\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\uff0112\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9ab8\u9aa8\u306f\u3082\u3046\u53e4\u3044"]}

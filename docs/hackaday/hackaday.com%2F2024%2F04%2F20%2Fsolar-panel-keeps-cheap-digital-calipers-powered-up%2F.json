Unfortunately, cheap digital calipers are also cheap, and tend to burn through batteries quickly. Sure, you can remove the battery when youre done using them, but thats for suckers  winners turn to solar power to keep their calipers always at the ready.\n[Johan]s solar upgrade begins with, unsurprisingly, a solar cell, one that just fits on the back of his digital calipers. Like most of these cheap calipers, this one is powered by a single 1.5 V LR44 button cell, while the polycrystalline solar cell is rated for 5 V, so [Johan] used a red LED as a crude voltage regulator. He also added a stack of fourteen 100 \u03bcF SMD capacitors soldered together in parallel. The 1206 devices form a 1,400 \u03bcF block thats smaller than the original button cell so that everything fits in the vacated battery compartment. Its pretty slick.\nGiven their agreeable price point, digital calipers are a tempting target for hacking. Weve seen a ton of them, from accessibility add-ons to WiFi connectivity and even repurposing them for use as DROs. Ever wonder how these things work? Weve looked at that, too."}

His code was malicious in the extreme, designed as it was to regularly search for his Active Directory entry and fire off a series of crippling commands should it appear he had been fired. His 2019 sacking and subsequent deletion of his AD profile triggered the job, wreaking havoc on servers and causing general mayhem. Whatever satisfaction Lu drew from that must have been fleeting, because he was quickly arrested, brought to trial in federal court, and found guilty of causing intentional damage to protected computer systems.\nLu faced a decade in federal prison for the stunt, but at his sentencing last week, he got four years behind bars followed by three years of supervised release. Thats still a pretty stiff sentence, and depending on where he serves it, things might not go well for him. Uber-geek Chris Boden has some experience in the federal prison system as a result of some cryptocurrency malfeasance; his video on his time in lockup is probably something Mr. Lu should watch while he can. Honestly, we feel bad for him in a way because weve been there; we certainly toyed with the logic bomb idea when we were coding for a living, without actually ever doing it. Maybe he thought it would just get treated as a prank, but that was probably never in the cards; as were fond of telling our kids, the world just doesnt have a sense of humor anymore.\n\nSpeaking of prison, when was the last time you had to use a floppy drive? Retrocomputer fans excepted, chances are good its quite a long time ago, unless youre an inmate in the New Jersey State Prison, where USB drives are not allowed. Instead, prisoners working on appeals or continuing their education are forced to use 1.44-MB floppies to exchange data with the outside world. The New Jersey prison rules seem a bit anachronistic, since they allow a pretty generous stack of 3.5 floppies  20 diskettes  but disallow USB sticks. True, the USB form factor is more easily accommodated in the standard-issue prison wallet, but the materials in a stack of floppies seem like they could easily be fashioned into a shiv or shank.\nWeve said this before, but weve got to start hanging around a better class of dumpster. Were we to, we might get as lucky as a Redditor who reports finding a sextet of 1 TB solid-state drives in a bin. The lucky dumpster diver doesnt say much about where they were found, perhaps wisely so, but other Redditors in the thread were quick to point out that they were probably in the trash for a reason, and that they might be a little clapped out if they came from a server array. Still, 6TB of free storage isnt something one lightly passes up on, and even if the drives have seen better days, theyll probably be adequate for non-critical applications. For our part, wed love to find one of those mythical dumpsters that seem to spawn things like Selectric typewriters, supercontinuum lasers, or even all the makings of a semiconductor fab.\nAnd finally, Brian Potter over at Construction Physics posted an excellent essay this week on the early history of the Ford Model T, the automobile that gave birth to Americas car culture, for better or for worse. Everyone seems to know the story of how Henry Ford invented the assembly line and drove the cost of a car down to around $400, making motoring accessible to the masses. And while thats kind of true  Ford is said to have picked up the idea of moving the workpiece rather than the workers from slaughterhouses  it leaves out a lot of interesting details, which Brian picks up on. We were particularly struck by how late in the game Ford introduced assembly lines to Model T production; it wasnt until 1913, and then only as a small-scale line to assemble the flywheel magnetos used in the ignition system. Once that line proved itself by reducing magneto assembly times by a factor of four, Fords process engineers began rolling out the concept across the plant. There are a ton of other tidbits in the article  enjoy!"}

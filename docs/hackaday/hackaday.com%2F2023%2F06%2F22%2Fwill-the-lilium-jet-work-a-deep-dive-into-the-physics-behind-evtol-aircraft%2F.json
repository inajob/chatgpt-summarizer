As anyone who has any experience with VTOL knows, its a tricky subject to engineer, let alone when you want to do it fully electric. In a deep-dive video on the Lilium Jet and eVTOL in general, [John Lou] goes through the physics behind VTOL take-off, landing and flight, as well as range and general performance.\nIt is clear that Liliums presented aircraft concept has many issues, some of which are due to new and unproven technologies, while others seem to be founded in over-promising and likely under-delivering. With Lilium having signed a number of contracts to deliver the first Pioneer Edition Lilium Jets and commercial service promised by 2025, its hard to ignore that the first full prototype of the 7-seater Lilium Jet is supposed to fly this year.\nAlthough as [John] points out in the video, eVTOL is not an impossible concept, it is important to remain realistic about what is physically possible, and not seek to push the boundaries. When the UK introduced its first mass-produced VTOL jet in the form of the Harrier, it too faced an uncomfortable time as bugs got ironed out. As these eVTOL aircraft would be carrying real human passengers, its a good place to realize that although you can pick a fight with physics, you will never come out on the winning side.\nHopefully Lilium realizes this too, and these sleek, battery-powered aircraft will truly take to the skies in a few years.\n\n", "title": "Lilium Jet: \u4e16\u754c\u521d\u306e\u5546\u7528eVTOL\u6a5f\u304c\u767b\u5834 ", "body": "\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306eLilium GmbH\u793e\u304c\u5e02\u5834\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u52d5\u5782\u76f4\u96e2\u7740\u9678\uff08eVTOL\uff09\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u3092\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002VTOL\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u3001\u7279\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u56f0\u96e3\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u5546\u696d\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306f2025\u5e74\u306b\u7d04\u675f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u73fe\u5b9f\u7684\u7bc4\u56f2\u5185\u306b\u7559\u3081\u3001\u4e88\u6e2c\u3092\u6291\u3048\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Lilium Jet: \u4e16\u754c\u521d\u306e\u5546\u7528eVTOL\u6a5f\u304c\u767b\u5834 ", "\u96fb\u52d5\u5782\u76f4\u96e2\u7740\u9678\u6a5f(Lilium Jet)\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u8ab2\u984c ", "Lilium Jet\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u3084\u958b\u767a\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u9032\u6357\u306b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u611f ", "\u529b\u5b66\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308beVTOL\u6a5f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5c06\u6765\u50cf\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f ", "Lilium Jet: \u6280\u8853\u7684\u306b\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7bc4\u56f2\u306e\u67a0\u5185\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u8ef8\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42"]}

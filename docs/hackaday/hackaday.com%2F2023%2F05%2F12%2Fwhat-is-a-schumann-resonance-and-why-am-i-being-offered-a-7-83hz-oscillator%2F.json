Perhaps its something akin to social media doomscrolling without the induced anger, and its certainly entertaining to see some of the weird and wonderful products that can be had for a few dollars and a couple of weeks wait. Every now and then something pops up that deserves a second look, and its one of those that has caught my attention today. Why am I being offered planar PCB coils with some electronics, described as Schumann resonators? What on earth is Schumann resonance, anyway?\nAtmospheric Physics Meets Cheap Junk\nThe different modes of Schumann resonance in the atmosphere. Neotesla CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe second question is easy enough to answer, the Schumann resonances occur in the electromagnetic spectrum of the earth, and are the result of resonances in the waveguide created between the electrically charged and thus radio-reflective ionosphere and the planets surface. Just as a small section of microwave waveguide on your bench can have an electromagnetic resonant frequency, so can this huge planet-sized space.\nThe waveguide on your desk will probably resonate in the thousands of megahertz, while the atmospheric waveguide has its resonance in the very low frequencies, in the order of hertz with a fundamental frequency around 7.8 Hz and a series of harmonic frequencies\nThe story of the Schumann resonances is interesting in itself, because rather than being discovered through observation they were predicted in 1952 in a mathematical study of the ionosphere by a German physicist, Winfried Otto Schumann. He originally calculated a frequency of around 10 Hz. A decade later their existence was proved, and studies have shown them to be excited by lightning strikes. Their resonant frequency is lower than Schumann predicted because of the slower-than-light transmission speed in the earths atmosphere, and they are part of the field of climate and atmospheric science, and as an example their activity has been used as a marker of global temperature. Indeed, the frequency varies over the course of a day as different parts of the earth are exposed to the sun  the oft-cited 7.83 Hz value actually wanders around 7.5 Hz to 8.3 Hz.\nAll this is fascinating stuff, but whats the connection between a global scale electromagnetic resonance requiring all those (naturally, 1.21 jiggawatt) lightning strikes to excite and which is of great interest to climate scientists, and a little AC magnetic field generator on a PCB from China? The answer took a bit of web searching to find out, and sadly its not the scientific breakthrough we might have hoped for.\nDoes It Work? Its All In Your Head\nIs there nothing this thing cant do?\nA natural resonant frequency on a planetary scale is for engineers and physicists an interesting and entirely explainable physical phenomenon. Its got a clear derivation and a mathematical proof that works, and its even got a few useful applications for climate scientists.\u00a0 But of course, not everyone who happens upon Schumann resonance has that background or training, and among those are a section who perhaps read a little bit more into it than they should.\nMy web search took me into people who believe that Schumann resonance is a heartbeat for a somehow sentient planet, something with which we have somehow lost touch, and turn the coincidence that some human brainwaves are around the same frequency into a vital connection. It seems that the Schumann resonators arent there for the planet but instead for us, theyre intended to stimulate the right brain waves which have somehow been lost due to our modern high-tech lifestyles. That theyre also claimed to improve the sound from HiFi systems and reduce pollutants in the air is the cherry on the cake.\nSo sadly the Schumann resonators have nothing to do with the ionosphere, and who knows, might just even be completely useless in themselves. In the past Ive bought a few similarly pseudoscience devices for a teardown and investigation, but this time I somehow cant find it within me to shell out twenty dollars or so on this one. Still, its been interesting to learn about the ionospheric resonance.\nCan any of you think of a use for a ELF oscillator and planar coil that doesnt involve pseudoscience? The comments await."}

This was fueled in part by companies like Intel and AMD going head-to-head in the marketplace with massive ad campaigns to build brand recognition; remember Intel Inside?\nIn 1993, Intel was making some headway in that regard. The splashy launch of their new Pentium chip in 1993 was a huge event. Unfortunately an esoteric bug in the floating-point division module came to the publics attention. [Ken Shirriff]s excellent account of that kerfuffle goes into great detail about the discovery of the bug. The issue was discovered by [Dr. Thomas R. Nicely] as he searched for prime numbers. Its a bit of an understatement to say this bug created a mess for Intel. The really interesting stuff is how the so-called FDIV bug, named after the floating-point division instruction affected, was actually executed in silicon.\nWe wont presume to explain it better than [Professor Ken] does, but the gist is that floating-point division in the Pentium relied on a lookup table implemented in a programmable logic array on the chip. The bug was caused by five missing table entries, and [Ken] was able to find the corresponding PLA defects on a decapped Pentium. Whats more, his analysis suggests that Intels characterization of the bug as a transcription error is a bit misleading; the pattern of the missing entries in the lookup table is more consistent with a mathematical error in the program that generated the table.\nThe Pentium bug was a big deal at the time, and in some ways a master class on how not to handle a complex technical problem. To be fair, this was the first time something like this had happened on a global scale, so Intel didnt really have a playbook to go by. [Ken]s account of the bug and the dustup surrounding it is first-rate, and if you ever wanted to really understand how floating-point math works in silicon, this is one article you wont want to miss.", "title": "\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a6\u30e0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306eFDIV\u30d0\u30b0\u306e\u771f\u76f8", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u3001Intel\u306e\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3002\u6d6e\u52d5\u5c0f\u6570\u70b9\u6f14\u7b97\u306e\u6b20\u9665\u304c\u767a\u899a\u3057\u3001Intel\u306b\u6df7\u4e71\u3092\u62db\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a6\u30e0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306eFDIV\u30d0\u30b0\u306e\u771f\u76f8", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u3068AMD\uff1a1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePC\u6226\u4e89", "\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u6f14\u7b97\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a6\u30e0\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u6559\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6559\u8a13", "\u521d\u306e\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u306a\u6280\u8853\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

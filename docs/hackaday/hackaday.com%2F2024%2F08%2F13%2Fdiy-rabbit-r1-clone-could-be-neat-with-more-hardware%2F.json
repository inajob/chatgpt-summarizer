One such example is the Rabbit R1, an AI-powered personal assistant that retails for $199. It was also revealed that its basically a small device running a simple Android app. That raises the question  could build your own dupe for $20? Thats what [Thomas the Maker] did.\nMeet Rappit. Its basically [Thomas]s take on an AI friend that doesnt break the bank. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, which has the benefit of integrated wireless connectivity on board. Its powered by rechargeable AA batteries or a USB power bank to keep things simple. [Thomas] then wrapped it all up in a cute 3D printed enclosure to give it some charm.\nIts software that makes the Rappit what it is. Rather than including a screen, microphone, or speakers on the device itself, [Thomas] interacts with the Pi-based device via smartphone. It makes it a less convincing dupe of the self-contained Rabbit R1, but the basic concept is the same. [Thomas] can make queries of the Rappit via a simple Android or iOS app he created called Comfyspace, and the Rappit responds with the aid of Googles Gemini AI.\nIf youre really trying to duplicate the trend of AI assistants, you really need standalone hardware. To that end, the Rappit design could really benefit from a screen, microphone, speaker, and speech synth. Honestly, though, that would only take you a few hours extra work compared to what [Thomas] has already done here. As it is, [Thomas] could simply throw away the Raspberry Pi and just use the smartphone with Gemini directly, right? But he chose this route of using the smartphone as an interface to keep costs down by minimizing hardware outlay.\nIf you want a real Rabbit R1, you can order one here. Weve discussed controversy around the device before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

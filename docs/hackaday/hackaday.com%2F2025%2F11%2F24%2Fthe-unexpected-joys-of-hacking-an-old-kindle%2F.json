The hand-written note explained that the device was in shambles  not only was its e-ink display visibly broken, but the reader was stuck in some kind of endless boot loop. I might have left it there if it wasnt for the closing remark: Have Fun!\nTruth is, the last thing I needed was\u00a0another Kindle. My family has already managed to build up a collection of the things. But taking a broken one apart and attempting to figure out what was wrong with it did seem like it would be kind of fun, as Id never really had the opportunity to dig into one before. So I brought it home and promptly forgot about it as Supercon was only a few weeks away and there was plenty to keep me occupied.\nThe following isnt really a story about fixing a Kindle, although it might seem like it on the surface. Its more about the experience of working on the device, and the incredible hacking potential of these unassuming gadgets. Whether youve got a clear goal in mind, or just want to get your hands dirty in the world of hardware hacking, you could do far worse than picking a couple of busted Kindles up for cheap on eBay.\nIf theres a singular takeaway, its that the worlds most popular e-reader just so happens to double as a cheap and impressively capable embedded Linux development environment for anyone whos willing to crack open the case.\n\nGetting Connected\nWe start with whats essentially Hardware Hacking 101: the hidden serial debug port. Its the sort of thing you learn to look for when taking apart a new gadget, and unsurprisingly, its also at the heart of Kindle hacking. While theres plenty of software modifications you can do depending on the age and version of your particular Kindle, opening up the case and tapping into the serial port is always the most direct way to gain access to the system.\n\n\n\n\nFrom my research, every Kindle (with the possible exception of the very latest models from the 2020s) have an unpopulated serial port on the board. In the case of this Kindle Paperwhite 2 from 2013, its even labeled. I simply soldered on some jumper wires and ran them out to a pin header to make connecting to it a little less fiddly. The only thing to watch out for is the voltage; it seems that the serial port on the majority of Kindles is 1.8 V, and connecting up a higher voltage USB-serial adapter without a level shifter could release the Magic Smoke.\n\nWith the hardware connected and my favorite serial communications tool running, it was easy to see what ailed this particular Kindle. As evidenced by the final few lines of the kernel messages, a failure of one of the voltage regulators in the MAX77696  a power management IC designed specifically for e-ink readers  was preventing the driver module from loading fully. This in turn was triggering a reboot, presumably because some sort of watchdog routine was in place to bail out if any critical hardware issues were detected.\nOn the Hunt\nComing from the normal Linux world, the solution seemed easy enough. Since the screen was toast anyway, all I needed to do to get the Kindle booting was to prevent the kernel module from loading. That way I could at least use it for something, perhaps an energy efficient minimalist server.\nBut\u00a0according to the MAX77696 datasheet, the chip was responsible for quite a bit more than simply driving the e-ink panel. If I pulled the kernel module entirely, there was a good chance Id also lose features like the real-time clock and the ability to read the battery voltage as well. So I decided to change tactics: rather than keeping the driver from loading, Id take out the watchdog that was forcing the system to reboot. But where was it?\nAmazon makes it easy to manually download the latest firmware for each member of the Kindle family, and the aptly named KindleTool lets you manipulate them. In this case I used the extract function to pull out the root filesystem image, which I could then locally mount as a basic EXT3 volume.\nThat was refreshingly straightforward, but unfortunately didnt get me where I needed to go. Using grep to search all the files within the filesystem for the string failed to load eink driver showed no hits. If the watchdog wasnt in the root filesystem, then where was it?\n\nUnpacking the firmware update with KindleTool also got me the kernel image, and running Binwalk against it showed there was a compressed filesystem at 0x466C. I reasoned this must be an initramfs  essentially a minimal Linux system that lives in RAM and gives the kernel a place to work as it brings up the rest of the system. If the system has some self-check capability, its reasonable to assume thats where it lives.\n\nAfter drilling down a few times with Binwalks extract function, I was able to get to the contents of the initramfs. Sure enough, another search for the error message revealed our sentinel: /bin/recovery-util.\nNew Kernel, Who Dis?\nI had considered trying to simply remove the recovery-util program from the kernel image, but since I wasnt 100% sure how the whole watchdog system functioned, there was no guarantee that would have worked without more trial and error. So, emboldened by how well this was all going for me so far, I took the nuclear option and decided to rebuild the kernel with my own initramfs.\nIts here that the Kindle software environment, and the community around it, really started to shine. Once again, Amazon made it ridiculously easy to get the source code for the exact firmware I was working with, and the community provided an actively maintained toolchain to build it with. A little more searching even pulled up some pre-compiled builds that were ready to use.\nActually building the kernel for the Kindle was essentially the same process as doing it on my desktop computer, with the notable addition of supplying the location of the cross compiler into each make command. But if I ever got off track, there were plenty of write-ups online to reference. I even found one that went over building a custom initramfs with BusyBox that doesnt include any of Amazons programs.\n\nBut perhaps the best part was that, once I had compiled Amazons modified kernel and built my initramfs, installing it on the Kindle was as simple as using a modified version of Androids fastboot command. There were no cryptographic hoops to jump through, you just give it the new kernel and away it went. Its my understanding that newer Kindles might not be so understanding, but with at least the hardware of this vintage, theres nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want.\nPocket Penguin Playground\nWith the source code, tools, and knowledge floating around out there, I was able to build my own kernel and initramfs that lets me boot into a full Linux environment on what was previously a non-functional Kindle. There are a few things I havent gotten to work yet, but I believe thats largely because Im still using the root filesystem provided by Amazon.\nNow that I know how easy it is to work with Linux on the Kindle, Im looking to push further and put together my own stripped-down environment without any of Amazons frameworks installed. Given how ridiculously cheap early Kindles are on the second hand market  especially if they have a busted screen  there are all sorts of tasks that I could see them performing if I had a solid base to build on.\nMake no mistake, Im greatly appreciative of the fact that we now have mature single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi available for a reasonable cost. But taking whats essentially consumer e-waste and turning it into a useful platform for learning and experimentation is the true hacker way. So whether youve got a Kindle collecting dust somewhere at home, or end up grabbing a few off of eBay for a song, I invite you to bust out the USB-serial adapter and start exploring.", "title": "\u7834\u640dKindle\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "body": "\u58ca\u308c\u305fKindle\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3002Linux\u74b0\u5883\u69cb\u7bc9\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u7834\u640dKindle\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "Kindle\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580", "\u58ca\u308c\u305fKindle\u3092Linux\u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff01Kindle\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Kindle\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u4f5cLinux\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

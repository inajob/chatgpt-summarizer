[The Action Lab] uses hot chocolate to demonstrate an odd acoustic effect. Tapping a container of hot chocolate  or even just hot water  will make a sound at a certain frequency. But if you keep tapping, the frequency of the sound will gradually increase. Dont know why? Dont worry, neither did scientists until around 1980.\nThe secret is bubbles and the speed of sound through air vs a liquid. The speed of sound in the liquid and the height of the liquid in the cup set the frequency. However, the speed of sound changes based on the bubbles, which alters the frequency.\n\nThis is one of those subtle things you probably never noticed and, if you did, you probably didnt think much about. Still, theres a physics lesson around every corner. Besides, this is one experiment that you can end with a tasty beverage. You only need some mix and your ears or, if you prefer, a cell phone app to read audio frequencies. You can also just use hot tap water, but what fun is that?\nUsually, we are talking about bubbles in the context of futuristic display devices. Then again, not always.\n"}

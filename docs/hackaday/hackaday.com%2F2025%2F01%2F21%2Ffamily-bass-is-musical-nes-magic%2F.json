Meet the Family Bass.\nThe core of the project is a special adapter which [Linus] created to work with the Family BASIC keyboard. Traditionally, the keyboard plugs into the Famicoms expansion port, but [Linus] wanted to hook it up to the controller port on a Nintendo Entertainment System instead. Getting them to talk was achieved with an ATtiny85 which could cycle through the 72-key matrix in the keyboard and spit out a serial stream of data the controller port could understand.\nOn the NES end, the console is set up to run custom code from [Linus] that lets him play the internal sound chips triangle wave with the keyboard. He demonstrates this ably in a video where he performs a song called Platform Hopping along with some of his other retro computer instruments.\nWeve seen [Linus] build some other great instruments in the past too, which are both creative and nostalgic. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306eFamily BASIC\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001NES\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u6f14\u594f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- ATtiny85\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- NES\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u594f\u3067\u308b\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u697d\u5668\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u30db\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u6f14\u594f\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

If theres a flaw in the Pi as a camera though, it lies in the software, which can be slow and frustrating to use. [Martijn Braam] is here with an interesting project that might yield some useful results in this direction, hes making a Raspberry Pi studio camera.\nHis camera hardware is very straightforward, a Pi 5 and touchscreen with the HD camera module in a rough but serviceable wooden box. The interesting part comes in the software, in which hes written a low-latency GUI over an HDMI output camera application. Its designed to plug into video mixing hardware, and one of the HDMI outputs carries the GUI while the other carries the unadulterated video. We can see this used to great effect with for example OBS Studio. Its for now a work in progress as you can see in the video below the break, but we expect that it can only get better.\nThe video below exposes the obvious flaw in many Pi camera setups, that the available lenses dont match the quality of the sensor, in that good glass aint cheap. But we think its one to watch, and could provide competition for CinePi.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3067\u30c7\u30b8\u30ab\u30e1\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u306aGUI\u3068HDMI\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u4f4e\u9045\u5ef6GUI\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Raspberry Pi\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9\uff1a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u306f", "HDMI\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "Raspberry Pi\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1aCinePi\u3068\u306e\u7af6\u4e89\u306f\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f"]}

The paint job on the display is great, but the stripes on the keyboard and badging on are on another level. Be sure to check out the entire gallery on this one.\nAbout that keyboard  [John] started this project with two incomplete keyboards that each had a couple of broken switches. Since the two keyboards were compliments of each other parts-wise, they made a great pair, and [John] only had to swap out three switches to get it up and clacking.\nIn order to make it work with the Pi, [John] wrote a user-mode serial driver that uses the uinput kernel module to inject key events to the kernel. But he didnt stop there.\nAlthough the Pi supports composite video out, the OS doesnt provide any way to turn off the chroma color signal thats modulated on top of the basic monochrome NTSC signal, which makes the picture look terrible. To fix that, he wrote a command-line app that sets up the video controller to properly display a monochrome NTSC signal. Happy AVRing on your amazing setup, [John]!\nCheck Out This Refreshingly Small Keyboard\nImage by [AnnaRooks] via redditUsually when we see keyboards this small, they have tiny keys that are fully intended for thumb presses and thumb presses only. But what about something ultra-portable that has full-size keys?\nAlthough it might be hard to believe, [AnnaRooks] only uses about 20 of the 24 keys that make up this mint tin keyboard. She has a keymap for typing, gaming, and Diablo II.\nPersonally, and my feelings about layers aside, I dont think I could use a keyboard without thumb clusters at this point. Although you know what? It would make a great traveling macropad.\nThe Centerfold: A Close Look At Force Curves\nImage by [ThereminGoat] via redditWell, boys and girls, weve got a smart beauty this time around. This here is an industrial key switch force tester. [ThereminGoat] is gonna tell you all about force curves and how to read them.\nWhat even is a force curve, and why is it so important? It refers to the graphical representation of the force required to press a key to the actuation point (y) versus the distance traveled during the press (x). So, its only critical to evaluating key switch performance. Key points along the force curve include the starting force, the actuation point, the tactile bump if present, the bottom-out force, and the return curve.\nSo, why does it actually matter? Force curves help us understand how light or heavy a switch feels, the actuation behavior, and help with customization. Ill let [ThereminGoat] take it from here.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: My IBM Wheelwriter 5\nYou know, I kind of cant believe that Ive now gone 47 Keebins without spotlighting my daily driver, which takes up most of my second desk. She may not look like much, but she types like the wind, and has that legendary buckling-spring keyboard to boot.\nSure, the Selectrics get all the love, and rightfully so. But if you actually want to use a typewriter day in and day out, you really cant beat its successor, the Wheelwriter. IBM produced these machines from 1984 to 1991, and Lexmark took over, cranking them out until 2001. Mine shows an install date of 4/22/85.\nThe Wheelwriter was IBMs first daisy wheel typewriter, which replaced the golf ball type element that signified the Selectric. Arguably even easier to swap than the golf ball, these slim cartridges lay flat for easy storage.\nWhereas the Selectric used a mainspring and an escapement like traditional machines, the Wheelwriter has a stepper motor that moves the print head and a solenoid that strikes the daisy wheel against the paper. It makes a delightfully frightening noise on startup as it tests the stepper and solenoid and spins the daisy wheel with alarming swiftness. I love this machine!\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('audio');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wheelwriter-startup.mp3\nICYMI: Updated Mouse Ring Now Uses Joystick\nAre you tired of traditional mouse and keyboard input, even though youve got a sweet ergo split and a trackball? Maybe youre just looking to enhance your VR setup. Whatever youre into, consider building [rafgaj78]s Mouse Ring.\nAs you might be able to discern from the picture, this baby is based on the Seeed Xiao nRF52840 and uses a tiny battery pack. This is version two of the ring mouse, so if you prefer buttons to a joystick, then the first iteration may be more your style. Keep in mind that version two is easier to assemble and comes in more ring sizes.\nThere are two modes to this mouse ring. In the first mode, the joystick does left and right mouse click and wheel up-down, and pushing will wake it from deep sleep. In the second mode, the joystick acts as the mouse pointer, and you push down to left click.\nI love the elegant design of the ring itself, and it looks great in yellow. Hmm, maybe I need one of these\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it?

He has one now that is a little beat up, but we feel like he sees it through his six-year-old eyes as a shiny new computer. The computer, which you can see in the video below, was a clone of the Spectrum 48K.\nThe box is somewhat klunky-looking, and inside is also a bit strange. The power supply is a  for the time  state-of-the-art switching power supply. Since it wasnt in good shape, he decided to replace it with a more modern supply.\nThe main board was also not in good shape. A Zilog CPU is on a large PCB with suspicious-looking capacitors. The mechanical keyboard is nothing more than a array of buttons, and wouldnt excite todays mechanical key enthusiast.\n\nThe computer isnt working yet. [Kasyan] is looking for someone who has the exact schematic, although hes found a similar one and identified at least some of the problems on the board.\nThe USSR did a lot of work with early computing, but we dont hear as much about it. Thats surprising, as they had a very active home computer scene.\n"}

He has one now that is a little beat up, but we feel like he sees it through his six-year-old eyes as a shiny new computer. The computer, which you can see in the video below, was a clone of the Spectrum 48K.\nThe box is somewhat klunky-looking, and inside is also a bit strange. The power supply is a  for the time  state-of-the-art switching power supply. Since it wasnt in good shape, he decided to replace it with a more modern supply.\nThe main board was also not in good shape. A Zilog CPU is on a large PCB with suspicious-looking capacitors. The mechanical keyboard is nothing more than a array of buttons, and wouldnt excite todays mechanical key enthusiast.\n\nThe computer isnt working yet. [Kasyan] is looking for someone who has the exact schematic, although hes found a similar one and identified at least some of the problems on the board.\nThe USSR did a lot of work with early computing, but we dont hear as much about it. Thats surprising, as they had a very active home computer scene.\n", "title": "- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u88fdRADUGA\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u6d3b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Kasyan\u306f\u53e4\u3044RADUGA\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u4e2d\u3002\u8cc7\u6599\u63a2\u3057\u306b\u596e\u95d8\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u88fdRADUGA\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u6d3b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u547d\uff1aRADUGA\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- USSR\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6587\u5316\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff1aRADUGA\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eRADUGA\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u6311\u6226"]}

[Timber Rough] has a wooden desk lamp that not only looks good but has one of the most unusual dimming features weve seen.\nOne thing that stands out is the lamp is made of different kinds of wood, and that helps. But the dimmer is a magnet and Hall effect sensor that levitates. It is hard to explain, but a quick look at the video below will clarify it.\n\nThe lamp software borrows from another project so it has animated effects and WiFi control with little effort. A custom usermod handles the custom levitating dimmer.\nIf you decide to duplicate the lamp, the instructions are very detailed, and any questions you may have will probably succumb to the video. The project is a fusion of woodworking, laser skills, and electronics. Overall, it is a beautiful and well-documented project.\nOf course, you could go the simple route. If you want to add more features, theres plenty of brainpower in the lamp.\n"}

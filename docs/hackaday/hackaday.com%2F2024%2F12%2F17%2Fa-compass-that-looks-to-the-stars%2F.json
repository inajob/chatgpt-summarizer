The major weakness here, though, is that this is a single point of failure. If there\u2019s no cell service, if the battery dies, or you find yourself flying a bomber during World War II then youre going to need another way to navigate, possibly using something like this Astro Compass.\nThe compass, as its name implies, also doesnt rely on using the Earths magnetic field since that would have been difficult or impossible inside of an airplane. Instead, it can use various celestial bodies to get a heading. But its not quite as simple as pointing it at a star and heading off into the wild blue yonder. First youll need to know the current time and date and look those up in a companion chart. The chart lists the global hour angle and the declination for a number of celestial bodies which can be put into the compass. From there the latitude is set and the local hour angle is calculated and set, and then the compass is rotated until the object is sighted. After all of that effort, a compass heading will be shown.\nFor all its complexity, a tool like this can be indispensable in situations where modern technology fails. While it does rely on precise tabulated astrometric data to be on hand, as long as thats available its almost failsafe, especially compared to a modern smartphone. Of course, youll also need a fairly accurate way of timekeeping which can be difficult in some situations.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\uff01\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306eGPS\u306f\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u304c\u3001\u96fb\u6ce2\u3084\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u5207\u308c\u308b\u3068\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3002\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u5929\u4f53\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\uff01\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- GPS\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044\u6642\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5929\u4f53\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u306b\u983c\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1a\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u5929\u4f53\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u822a\u6cd5\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u9375\uff01\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u306e\u5fc5\u9700\u6027"]}

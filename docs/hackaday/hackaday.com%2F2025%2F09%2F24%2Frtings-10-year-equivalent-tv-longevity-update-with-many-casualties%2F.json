In their most recent update, we not only\u00a0 find out about the latest casualties, but also the impending end of the experiment after 18,000 hours  as the TVs are currently failing left and right as they accelerate up the ascending ramp of the bathtub curve.\nSome of these LEDs are dead, others are just wired in series.\nThe dumbest failure type has to be the TVs (such as the Sony X90J) where the failure of a single dead backlight LED causes the whole TV to stop working along with series-wired LED backlights where one dead LED takes out a whole strip or zone. Other failures include degrading lightguides much as with our last update coverage last year, which was when edge-lit TVs were keeling over due to overheating issues.\nDetailed updates can be found on the constantly updating log for the experiment, such as on the failed quantum dot diffusor plate in a TCL QLED TV, as the quantum dots have degraded to the point of green being completely missing. Although some OLEDs are still among the living, theyre showing severe degradation  as pictured above  after what would be the equivalent of ten years of typical usage.\nOnce the experiment wraps up it will be fascinating to see who the survivors are, and what the chances are of still using that shiny new TV ten years from now.\n\n", "title": "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u9577\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u8a66\u3059\uff1aRTINGS\u306e\u52a0\u901f\u8001\u5316\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u306eRTINGS\u304c\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u52a0\u901f\u52a3\u5316\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u6545\u969c\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308b\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d42\u4e86\u5f8c\u3001\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u8a55\u4fa1\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u9577\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u8a66\u3059\uff1aRTINGS\u306e\u52a0\u901f\u8001\u5316\u5b9f\u9a13", "LED\u306e\u6545\u969c\u304c\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u5168\u4f53\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u753b\u8cea\u52a3\u5316\u304c\u9032\u3080\uff01RTINGS\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "OLED\u3068QLED\u3001\u3069\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u304c\u9577\u6301\u3061\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "18,000\u6642\u9593\u306e\u8a66\u9a13\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

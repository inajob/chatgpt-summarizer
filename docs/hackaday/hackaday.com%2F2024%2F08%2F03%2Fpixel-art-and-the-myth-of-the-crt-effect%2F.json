In fits of mistaken nostalgia this has led both to modern-day extreme cubism pixel art and video game CRT filters that respectively fail to approach what pixel art was about, or why old games looked the way they did back with our NES and SNES game consoles. This is a point which [Carl Svensson] vehemently argues from a position of experience, and one which is likely shared by quite a few of our readers.\nAlthough there is some possible color bleed and other artefacts with CRTs due to the shadow mask (or Sonys Trinitron aperture grille), there was no extreme separation between pixels or massive bleed-over into nearby pixels to create some built-in anti-aliasing as is often claimed unless you were using a very old/cheap or dying CRT TV. Where such effects did happen was mostly in the signal being fed into the CRT, which ranged from the horrid (RF, composite) to the not-so-terrible (S-Video, component) to the sublime (SCART RGB), with RGB video (SCART or VGA) especially busting the CRT effect myth.\nWhere the pixel art of yester-year shines is in its careful use of dithering and anti-aliasing to work around limited color palettes and other hardware limitations. Although back in the Atari 2600 days this led to the extreme cubism which were seeing again in modern retro pixel art games, yesterdays artists worked with the hardware limitations to create stunning works of arts, which looked great on high-end CRTs connected via RGB and decent via composite on the kids second-hand 14 color set with misaligned electron guns.", "title": "CRT\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u795e\u8a71\u3068\u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "\u6614\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u3088\u308a\u826f\u304f\u898b\u3048\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3001\u30ab\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u7dda\u7ba1\uff08CRT\uff09\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5e73\u6ed1\u5316\u3068\u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u52b9\u679c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u305f\u304b\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u9650\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["CRT\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u795e\u8a71\u3068\u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\uff1aCRT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068CRT\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8aa4\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u672c\u8cea\uff1a\u8272\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u7d04"]}

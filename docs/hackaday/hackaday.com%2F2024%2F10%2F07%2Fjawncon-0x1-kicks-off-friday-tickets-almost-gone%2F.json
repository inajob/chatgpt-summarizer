If youre in the Philadelphia area this weekend, you can get a front-row seat to this rare spectacle as JawnCon moves into its second year.\nRunning Friday into Saturday at Arcadia University, JawnCon 0x1 promises to be a celebration of technology, with a unique bend towards the glory days of the 80s and 90s  back when screeching noises coming out of the back of your computer was nothing to worry about. With talks that cover resurrecting payphones and spinning up your own AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), to a badge that will let attendees literally dial into an array of early Internet services, hackers of a certain vintage should feel right at home.\nJawnCon Modem Badge\nNo gray beard? No problem. The early Internet theme certainly isnt meant to exclude the younger players. In fact, quite the opposite. Theres an undeniable benefit to studying the fundamentals of any topic, and just as the 4-bit badge from Supercon 2022\u00a0gave many attendees their first taste of programming bare metal, JawnCon 0x1 ticket holders will get the opportunity to study protocols and techniques which you dont often get a chance to work with these days. How you gonna keep em down on the farm after theyve seen pppd?\nAs of this writing there are still tickets available, but its getting down to the wire so we wouldnt recommending sitting on that fence for too much longer. Judging by what this team managed to pull off in their first year, were confident that JawnCon 0x1 (and beyond) are going to be well worth the trip.", "title": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308bJawnCon 0x1\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306890\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u79f0\u3048\u308b", "body": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308bJawnCon 0x1\u306f\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u796d\u5178\u3067\u300180\u5e74\u4ee3\u308490\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5316\u3092\u79f0\u3048\u308b\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3002\u65e7\u5f0f\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u304b\u3089\u30d9\u30c6\u30e9\u30f3\u307e\u3067\u53c2\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6b8b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6025\u3044\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3092\u63a8\u5968\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308bJawnCon 0x1\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306890\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u79f0\u3048\u308b", "JawnCon 0x1\uff1a\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u304b\u3089\u30d9\u30c6\u30e9\u30f3\u307e\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17", "JawnCon 0x1\uff1a\u65e9\u3081\u306b\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "JawnCon 0x1\uff1a\u65b0\u9032\u6c17\u92ed\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "JawnCon 0x1\uff1a\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f53\u9a13"]}

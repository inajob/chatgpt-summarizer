The RP1 hangs of the CPUs PCIe bus and takes on many functions previously in the SoC, and those curious about it now have a little bit of information. Eben Upton has posted an article about the chip, and theres a partial datasheet and a video in which the engineers talk about the chip as well.\nThe datasheet is intended to help anyone wishing to write a hardware driver for a Pi 5, and they admit that it doesnt reveal everything on the silicon. We dont expect them to put this chip up for sale on its own because doing so would enable their competitors to produce something much closer to a Pi 5 clone. It does reveal a few nuggets though; there are a couple of Cortex M3 cores for housekeeping, and alongside all the interfaces we know from earlier boards it has perhaps most interestingly for Hackaday readers, a 12-bit analogue-to-digital converter. This has always been on our Pi wishlist, and is a welcome addition.\nSo if you read the datasheet and watch the video below youll learn a lot about the interfaces and how to talk to them, but not quite so much about the full workings of the chip itself. They hint that theres more to be released, but since the Pi people have a history of not letting go of the family silver we wont be expecting the keys to the kingdom.\nHave a read of our Pi 5 launch coverage.\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u306f\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8c6a\u83ef\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3084\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b3\u30a2\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9M3\u3082\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u307b\u304b\u300112\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8ADC\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u516c\u958b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b12\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8ADC\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a45\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u7d30\u304c\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b"]}

He had a dig around in his junk box for inductors to attempt coupling to the wireless charger and lucked out with an inductor salvaged from his old inkjet printer.\nThere are actually open standards, known as the Qi standards, for how to negotiate power from a Qi device. But [bornach] ignored all of that. Instead he leveraged the fact that the Qi base station will periodically send out a ping containing a small measure of power to let compatible devices know that its available for negotiation. It is the energy in this ping that powers [bornach]s circuit!\nIn [bornach]s circuit a TL431 provides a regulated five volt supply which can be used to drive a microcontroller and a charliplexed array of ten LEDs. Pretty nifty stuff. If youre new to wireless charging you might like to know How Wireless Charging Works And Why It\u2019s Terrible.\n\n \n\n\n", "title": "\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u5df1\u88fd\u4f5c\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e[bornach]\u304c\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044Qi\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u304b\u3089\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u5df1\u88fd\u4f5c\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u5ec3\u54c1\u304b\u3089\u306e\u767a\u60f3\uff01\u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u96fb\u6e90", "Qi\u898f\u683c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u57fa\u5730\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08", "TL431\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u304b\u3089\u306e5V\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\uff1aLED\u3092\u70b9\u706f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

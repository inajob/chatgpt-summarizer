In theory, this should be easy to recreate for your own purposes. But why reinvent the wheel when [DarthKaker] has already done the work for you  assuming you only need two conductors.\nThe 3D-printed shells take the usual round magnets. Obviously, the north pole on one part should point to the south pole on the other part. In addition, if polarity matters, you should also have each housing contain one north-facing and one south-facing magnet so that the connectors will only mate one way.\nIt appears the project uses wires soldered or spot welded to the magnets. Heating magnets sometimes has bad effects, so we might try something different. For example, you could solder the wires to thin washers affixed to the magnets with epoxy, perhaps. Or use the magnets for alignment and make a different arrangement for the contacts, although that would take a different shell design.\nWe have talked about magnet soldering for connectors before. Dont forget that you can build magnets into your prints, too.", "title": "\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u7528\u78c1\u6c17\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u304c\u78c1\u6c17\u3067\u4ed8\u304f\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u306f\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u6975\u6027\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u914d\u7dda\u3092\u534a\u7530\u4ed8\u3051\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5225\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u78c1\u77f3\u306f\u5370\u5237\u7269\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u7528\u78c1\u6c17\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u78c1\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fcDIY", "\u78c1\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "\u78c1\u6c17\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u3068\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f"]}

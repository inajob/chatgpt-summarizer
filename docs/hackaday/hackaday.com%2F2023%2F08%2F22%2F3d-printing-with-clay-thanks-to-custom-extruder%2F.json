An extruder capable of pushing clay is critical, and\u00a0[davidsfeir] has an updated version suitable for an Ender 3 printer. This extruder is based on earlier designs aimed at delta printers, but making one compatible with an Ender 3 helps keep things accessible.\nLightly pressurized clay comes in via the clear tube. Air escapes out the top (motor side) while an auger homogenizes the clay and pushes it out the nozzle.\nWhats special about a paste extruder that can push clay? For one thing, clay cant be stored on a spool, so it gets fed into the extruder via a hose with the help of air pressure. From there, the clay is actually extruded with the help of an auger that takes care of pushing the clay down through the nozzle. The extruder also needs a way to deal with inevitable air bubbles, which it does by allowing air to escape out the narrow space at the top of the assembly while clay gets fed downward.\n[davidsfeir] was greatly inspired by the work of clay-printing pioneers [Piotr Wa\u015bniowski] and his de-airing clay extruder, and [Jonathan Keep], who has documented 3D printing with clay comprehensively in a freely-available PDF.\nThere are so many different aspects to printing with clay or clay-like materials that almost every part is ripe for innovation. For example, weve seen wild patterns result from sticking a thumping subwoofer under a print bed."}

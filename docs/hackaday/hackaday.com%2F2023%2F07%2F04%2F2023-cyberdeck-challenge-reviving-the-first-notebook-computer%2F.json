The result stays true to the original but gives us so much more in the shape of a Raspberry Pi, and its worth cracking it open to see what components make this happen.\nThe first impression from the pictures is how tidy it all is, with the various USB-based boards contained on a large piece of perfboard spanning the whole case. As well as a USB hub and UPS board theres an M.2 SSD interface and an audio board, and a DSI color TFT screen neatly fitted in place of the original monochrome item. Finally, theres an Adafruit keyboard matrix interface board, allowing the use of the Epsons original keys.\nWe like this conversion, because it manages to preserve a lot of what the original Epson had that made it great. Were reminded of a cyberdeck inspired by the other great 8-bit notebook, the TRS-80 model 100.\n \n\n"}

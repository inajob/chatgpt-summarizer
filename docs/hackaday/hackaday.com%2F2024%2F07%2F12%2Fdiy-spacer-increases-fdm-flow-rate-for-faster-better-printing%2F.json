Plus, the filament must be melted completely; a melty outside and a crunchy inside might be good for snacks, but not for 3D printing. Luckily, budget-minded hobbyists can build a drop-in booster to increase volumetric flow using only basic tools and materials.\n[aamott]s booster, which started life as a copper screw, is designed to replace the standard spacer in an extruder, with a bore that narrows as the filament gets closer to the nozzle to ensure that the core of the filament melts completely. Rather than a lathe, [aamott]s main tool is a drill press, which he used to drill a 0.7 mm bore through the screw using a PCB drill bit. The hole was reamed out with a 10\u00b0 CNC engraving bit, generating the required taper. After cutting off the head of the screw and cleaning up the faces, he cut radial slots into the body of the booster by threading the blade of a jewelers saw into the bore. The result was a bore wide enough to accept the filament on one end, narrowing to a (roughly) cross-shaped profile at the other.\nStacked up with a couple of knock-off Bondtech CHT nozzles, the effect of the booster was impressive  a 50% increase in flow rate. Its not bad for a prototype made with simple tools, and it looks a little easier to build than [Stefan]s take on the same idea.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6d41\u91cf\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dc\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "FDM\u901f\u3055\u306b\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u6eb6\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u5145\u586b\u738750\uff05\u5897\u52a0\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6d41\u91cf\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dc\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u9ad8\u901f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u6eb6\u89e3\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u6291\u3048\u3066\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dc\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u5b8c\u5168\u6eb6\u89e3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u57fa\u672c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3060\u3051\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9ad8\u52b9\u73873D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc"]}

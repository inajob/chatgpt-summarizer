It isnt surprising, then, that 3D printing in bulk differs from printing one object at a time. Of course, filling up your build plate is not a new idea. But [Keep Making] wants to encourage you to think in three dimensions and fill up your build volume in the Z axis, as well.\nWhen you fill your X and Y axes, it is easy to see how the parts separate. But with stack printing, you must separate the parts from different layers. Each part has a single-layer gap, and the top surfaces are ironed for a better finish. Sometimes the prints may stick, and the video shows how to use a screw to pop off recalcitrant prints. The technique produces one side that isnt as nice a finish as the other side, but it isnt bad, and for many applications, you dont care, anyway.\nBefore you get too excited about your own designs, you might try a simple test file and get your print settings dialed in. Obviously, if you need just two or three copies of something small, it is easier to step and repeat them across the build surface. But if you need to maximize your throughput or make multiple copies of large objects, this might be the technique for you.\nLooks like an interesting technique that doesnt require you to do anything strange like, say, waterproof your printer. No strings attached.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4e00\u5ea6\u306b\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306b\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3054\u3068\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u5225\u3005\u306b\u5206\u96e2\u3059\u308b\u3002\u8868\u9762\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u306f\u4e00\u90e8\u306b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u3002\u591a\u91cf\u306e\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306b\u306f\u6709\u52b9\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4e00\u5ea6\u306b\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Z\u8ef8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u30663D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u4f5c\u88fd\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306b\u4f5c\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u591a\u6570\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u3067\u4f5c\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

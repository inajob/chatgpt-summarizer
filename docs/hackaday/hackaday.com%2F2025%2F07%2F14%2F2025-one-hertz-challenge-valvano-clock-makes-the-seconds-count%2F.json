Its up to you to decide what to do with them.  while we couldnt tell you who [Jim Valvano] was without a google search*, his math checks out. The quote was sufficiently inspirational to inspire [danjovic] to create a clock count those seconds precisely.\nIts a simple project, both conceptually and electrically. All it does is keep time and count the seconds in the day a button press switches between counting down, counting up, and HH:MM:SS. In every mode, though, the number displayed will change at one Hertz, which we appreciate as being in the spirit of the challenge. There are only four components: \u00a0an Arduino Nano, a DS3231 RTC module, a SSD1306 12864 OLED module, and a momentary pushbutton. At the moment it appears this project is only on breadboard, which is a shame we think it deserves to have a fancy enclosure and pride of place on the wall. Wouldnt you be more productive if you could watch those 86,400 seconds ticking away in real time? We think it would be motivating.\nPerhaps it will motivate you to create something for our One Hertz Challenge. Plenty of seconds to go until the deadline on August 19th, after all. If youd rather while away the time reading, you can check out some of [danjovic]s other projects, like this Cistertian-inspired clock, or this equally-inscruitable timekeeper that uses binary-coded octal.\n \n\n\n\n\n*Following a google search, he was an American college basketball coach in the mid-20th century.", "title": "- \u300c86,400\u79d2\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "\u300c86,400\u79d2\u3092\u3069\u3046\u4f7f\u3046\u304b\u306f\u3042\u306a\u305f\u6b21\u7b2c\u300d\u3068\u306e\u540d\u8a00\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3001\u79d2\u3092\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c86,400\u79d2\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cArduino\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u6642\u8a08\u300d", "- \u300c\u6642\u9593\u3092\u7ba1\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\uff1aOne Hertz Challenge\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "- \u300c\u57fa\u672c\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01DS3231 RTC\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3068OLED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u300d", "- \u300cJim Valvano\u306e\u540d\u8a00\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u4f5c\u308a\u300d"]}

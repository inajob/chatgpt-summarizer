Sure, you could buy a clock, hang it on your wall, and move on with your day, or could spend a week or two building the perfect one. [Nejc Koncan] was in one such situation recently when he needed some new overhead lighting. He wanted hexagonal lights  and since none of the off-the-shelf solutions met his exacting requirements, he built his own.\nUnlike most of the cycling RGB hexagonal lighting solutions available on the market, [Nejc] wanted elegant white outlines that he could control via HomeAssistant. After some careful design and quite a bit of trial-and-error, he ended up with a highly modular and very professional-looking installation. The hexagons are constructed from LED strips set into aluminum extrusions, with junction PCBs at each intersection. To complete the look, all of the strips and wiring are hidden by diffusers that slot into the extrusions  and of course, the whole thing is open source.\nWe see lots of lighting projects here at Hackaday, and even other hexagonal lights  but this might just be one of the most refined. Sometimes its worth the extra effort to build a totally over-engineered custom solution."}

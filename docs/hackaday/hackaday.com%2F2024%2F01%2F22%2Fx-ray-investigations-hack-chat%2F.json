Before R\u00f6ntgens discovery that X-rays could penetrate living tissue, doctors had only limited (and often unpleasant) ways to get a look at what was going on inside the human body, and few of us would want to return to those days.\nAs fantastically useful as X-rays and later computed tomography (CT) became in medicine, it didnt take too long for other uses for the technology to come along. Non-clinical applications for X-ray and CT abound, including their use in non-invasively exploring relics of immense archaeological value. One recent effort in this space that gained a lot of coverage in the press was the combination of CT imaging and machine learning to read the ink inside carbonized papyrus scrolls from the ruins of Pompeii.\nThe result was the Vesuvius Challenge, where different teams looked for techniques to virtually unwrap the roasted relics. Ahrons contribution to the project was a little unusual  he bought a used desktop CT scanner, fixed it up, and started experimenting with reading ink from the carbonized remains of simulated papyrus scrolls. In other words, he made some scrolls, cooked them to beyond well-done in the oven, and tried to understand what happens to ink on papyrus that gets blasted by a volcano. If thats not enough to get you to stop by the Hack Chat when Ahron joins us, were not sure what else would be! Suffice it to say were pretty excited about what Ahron has to say about DIY CT,\u00a0 X-rays, collaborative open-source citizen science, and unwrapping the mysteries of Pompeii.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, January 17 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.\nFeatured image: Daderot, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons", "title": "1\u670824\u65e5\u6b63\u5348\u306b\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308bX\u7dda\u8abf\u67fb\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30f3\u6c0f\u3068\u306eX\u7dda\u8abf\u67fb\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\uff1fX\u7dda\u306f\u533b\u5b66\u3067\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30a2\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3\u6c0f\u306f\u4e2d\u53e4\u306e\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u907a\u8de1\u306e\u30d1\u30d4\u30eb\u30b9\u5dfb\u7269\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002DIY CT\u3001X\u7dda\u3001\u5171\u540c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5e02\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a71\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1\u670824\u65e5\u6b63\u5348\u306b\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308bX\u7dda\u8abf\u67fb\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01", "\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u3092\u89e3\u304d\u660e\u304b\u3059\uff1aDIY CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3067\u307e\u308b\u3054\u3068\u713c\u304b\u308c\u305f\u5dfb\u7269\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u89e3\u304f", "X\u7dda\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3067\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u306e\u5dfb\u7269\u3092\u4eee\u60f3\u7684\u306b\u958b\u5c01\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u306e\u907a\u8de1\u304b\u3089\u767a\u6398\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5dfb\u7269\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u8abf\u3079\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u6280\u8853", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304c\u30dd\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u89e3\u304f\u305f\u3081\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\uff1aX\u7dda\u8abf\u67fb\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf"]}

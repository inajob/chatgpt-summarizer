This isnt just a showpiece  this card actually, properly works when installed into our hackers Dell Precision M4800, and [sdz] tells us more on how the card came to be.\nEquipped with a VSA-100 GPU, this card has a whole lot of support components for adapting old interfaces to modern ones. Theres a PCIe-PCI bridge IC, an FPGA, HDMI muxes, and a Realtek scaler for video conversion. Handling all the MXM interfaces wouldve been downright impossible, so the card also holds an LVDS header for the M4800s panel. Plus, for testing all of it, [sdz] has developed a PCIe to MXM adapter board with minimal circuitry needed to have the card work  this is a seriously involved hack and its executed remarkably well.\nThe forum post shows a whole lot of the journey, from receiving the PCBs to code and FPGA gateware bringup, as well as videos of VGA and HDMI operation. In the end, our hacker shows us a fully working setup, the 3dfx card inserted into M4800 and driving its display, as well as overclocking experiments; the author has promised to open-source the card files in due time, too. Its seriously nice to see DIY MXM cards in the wild, and if you ever wanted to build one, weve got an article tells you everything you could want to know about the MXM standard.\nWe thank [Misel] for sharing this with us!\n\n"}

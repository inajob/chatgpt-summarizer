It simulates attempting to run a small hardware business sustainably. Buy parts, make products, and sell them without burning yourself out!\nIf youre not familiar with roll-and-write games, its a genre in which players take turns by rolling dice and then choosing how to assign those values in a game space as they progress from turn to turn. In the case of Hardware Hustle, its primarily a resource management game in which a player will be purchasing parts, assembling widgets, selling those widgets, and improving processes all while managing both money and opportunity costs.\nThe inspiration for Hardware Hustle comes from [Oskitone]s own experience designing, building, and selling things like open-sourced, hackable synth kits that are known for their thoughtful design and fantastic use of 3D printing.\nThe game is in open beta-testing mode, so if youd like to give it a try, head over to the PDF download section of the GitHub repository. Dont forget to share your thoughts with the feedback form after playing. (If youre wondering why a printable tabletop game has source code on GitHub, its because the games printable sheets are generated by JavaScript, making adjustments and tweaks and version control easier.)", "title": "1\u679a\u306e\u7d19\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHardware Hustle\u300d", "body": "[Oskitone]\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30b9\u30eb\u306f\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30011\u679a\u306e\u7d19\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u904b\u55b6\u3092\u6a21\u64ec\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3092\u71c3\u3048\u5c3d\u304d\u3055\u305b\u305a\u306b\u58f2\u308a\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01", "titles": ["1\u679a\u306e\u7d19\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHardware Hustle\u300d", "\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u9375\uff01\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u306e\u904b\u55b6\u3092\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u632f\u3063\u3066\u9032\u884c\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cHardware Hustle\u300d\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u3092\u7acb\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3088\u3046", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u6709\u540d\u306a[Oskitone]\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "GitHub\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u3067\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u4e2d\uff01\u300cHardware Hustle\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044"]}

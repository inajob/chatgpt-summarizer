These handheld computers acted as simple companions to a computer and could often handle calendars, email, notes and more. Their demise was spelled by the smartphone, but the nostalgia of having a simple handheld and romanticizing about the 90s and 2000s is still there. Fortunately for the nostalgic among our readers, [Ashtf] decided to give us a modern take on the classic PDAs.\n\nThe device is powered by an ESP32-S3 connected to two PCBs in a mini-laptop clamshell format. It features two displays, a main eInk for slow speed interaction and a little i2c AMOLED for more tasks which demand higher refresh then an eInk can provide. Next to the eInk display is a capacitive slider. For input, there is also a QWERTY keyboard with back resin printed keycaps and white air dry clay pressed into embossed lettering in the keys and finally sealed using nail polish to create a professional double-shot looking keycap. The switches are the metal dome kind sitting on the main PCB. The clamshell is a rather stylish clear resin showcasing the devices internals and even features a quick-change battery cover!\nThe devices operating system is truly where the magic happens. It features several apps including a tasks app, file wizard, and text app. The main purpose of the device is on the go note taking so much time has been taken with the excellent looking text app! It also features a docked mode which displays tasks and time when it detects a USB-C cable is connected. Plans exist in the future to implement a calender, desktop sync and even Bluetooth keybaord compatibility. The devices previous iteration is on GitHub with future plans to expand functionality and availability, so stay tuned for more coverage!\nThis is not the first time we have covered [Ashtfs] PDA journey, and we are happy to see the revisions being made!\n", "title": "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u7248PDA\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1aESP32-S3\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7", "body": "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044PDA\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002ESP32-S3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u98a8\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3002", "titles": ["- \u73fe\u4ee3\u7248PDA\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1aESP32-S3\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30a2\uff1a90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePDA\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u8996\u899a\u7684\u9b45\u529b\u6e80\u8f09\uff01\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u6a39\u8102\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u624b\u66f8\u304d\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "- \u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35\u306b\u671f\u5f85\uff01PDA\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u5c55\u671b"]}

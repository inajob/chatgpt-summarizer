You dont need a boatload of lab equipment. Just a cloud chamber. And [Curious Scientist] is showing off an\u00a0improved miniature cloud chamber that is easy to replicate using a 3D printer and common components.\nThe build uses a Peltier module, a CPU cooler, an aluminum plate, thermal paste, and headlight film. The high voltage comes from a sacrificed mosquito swatter. The power input for the whole system is any 12V supply.\nThe cloud chamber was high tech back in 1911 when physicist Charles T. R. Wilson made ionizing radiation visible by creating trails of tiny liquid droplets in a supersaturated vapor of alcohol or water. Charged particles pass through, leaving visible condensation trails.\n\nAccording to the post, the cost of everything is under $100. He hasnt made the 3D printed parts freely available, but there are enough pictures that you can probably work it out yourself. Besides, youd almost certainly have to rework it for your particular jar, anyway.\nAfter all, a cloud chambers construction isnt a state secret. Weve seen some fancy Peltier-based designs. If you manage your expectations, you can build one for even less using a plastic bottle and ingenuity."}

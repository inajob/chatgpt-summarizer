However, many modern vehicles having electronic parking brakes giving manufacturers a new avenue to paywall simple DIY repairs.\nMost EVs will rarely, if ever, need to replace their mechanical brake pads as in most driving situations the car will be predominantly relying on regenerative braking to slow down. A hot hatch like the Ioniq 5N, however, might go through brakes a lot faster if it spends a lot of time at the track, which is what happened with Reddit user [SoultronicPear].\nMuch to their chagrin, despite buying the required $60/wk subscription to the National Automotive Service Task Force (NASTF) and the $2,000 interface tool, [SoultronicPear]s account was suspended because it was not intended for use for anyone but service professionals. Not exactly a Right-to-Repair friendly move on Hyundais part. After trying a number of different third party tools, they finally found a Harbor Freight T7 bidirectional scan tool was able to issue the parking brake retract command to perform the pad swap, albeit not without throwing some error codes in the process.\nElectrification of vehicles should simplify repairs, but manufacturers are using it to do the opposite. Perhaps they should read our Minimal Motoring Manifesto? There is a glimmer of hope in the promises of Slate and Telo, but well have to see if they make it to production first.", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u304c DIY \u4fee\u7406\u3092\u59a8\u3052\u308b\u7406\u7531", "body": "\u73fe\u4ee3\u8eca\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u306fDIY\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u96e3\u5316\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u304c DIY \u4fee\u7406\u3092\u59a8\u3052\u308b\u7406\u7531", "- EV \u306e\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u304b\uff1f", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u4ea4\u63db\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u5236\u9650\u3068\u300c\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u6a29\u5229\u300d\u306e\u885d\u7a81", "- \u672a\u6765\u306e\u8eca\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u843d\u3068\u3057\u7a74"]}

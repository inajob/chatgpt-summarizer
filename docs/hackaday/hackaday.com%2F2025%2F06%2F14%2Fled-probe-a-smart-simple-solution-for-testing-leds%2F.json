This ingenious LED Probe from [David] packs a lot of useful features into a simple, easy-to-implement circuit.\nMost multimeters have a diode test function that can be used to check LEDs; however, this goes a step further. Not only will the probe light up an LED, it will light up no matter which side of the LED the leads are touching. A\u00a0 Red/Green LED on the probe will indicate if the probe tip is on the anode or cathode.\nThe probe is powered by a single CR2032 battery, and you may notice there\u2019s no on/off switch. That\u2019s because the probe enters a very low-current sleep mode between uses. The testing intelligence is handled by either an ATtiny85 or, in the newest version, an ATtiny202, though the basic concept and design are compatible with several other chips. All the design files for the PCB, the ATtiny code, a parts list, and a detailed explanation of how it works are available on [David]\u2019s site, so be sure to check them out. Once you build one of these probes, you\u2019ll want something to test it on, so explore some of the LED projects weve featured in the past."}

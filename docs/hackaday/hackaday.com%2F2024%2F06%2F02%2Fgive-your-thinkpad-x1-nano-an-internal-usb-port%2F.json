As [Joshua Stein] shows, it can be decently hard, but you will have fun along the way. His journey involves a Thinkpad X1 Nano, and his tech setup means itd be most comfortable for him to have a USB port inside its case, for a Logitech mouses USB receiver. It wasnt smooth sailing all throughout, but the end result is no doubt beautifully executed.\nM.2 B-key, A-key and E-key slots have USB 2.0 available on them  youd think thats perfect for such a receiver, and theres even plug and play adapters for this on places like eBay. Unfortunately, none of these, as Lenovo implements wireless card whitelists to this day. Tinkering with the whitelist on [Joshua]s laptop resulted in BIOS digital signature check failures, and the USB-connected fingerprint reader was ultimately chosen as the most viable path.\nInitially, hes tested the fingerprint reader with an FPC breakout, having the USB connection work  many a hacker would stop here, pulling a few bodge wires from the breakout. [Joshua], however, raised the bar, creating a flexible PCB that would pull the fingerprint connector signals to a spot in the case where the USB receiver could fit neatly, with a 5 V step-up on the board, too.\n[Joshua] tops it off by showing a 3D-printed spacer that goes into now-vacant spot where the fingerprint reader used to be. This mod is not open-source as far as we can see, but its definitely an inspiration. Want to put even more USB devices inside your laptop? Perhaps a tiny USB hub would help, in line with the EEE PC mods that aimed to stuff the tiny laptop with the largest amount of USB devices possible.", "title": "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u5185\u8535USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "body": "Thinkpad X1 Nano\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306bUSB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u969c\u5bb3\u306b\u906d\u9047\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u3046\u307e\u304f\u5b9f\u884c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002Lenovo\u306e\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3001\u67d4\u8edf\u57fa\u76e4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092USB\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u5185\u8535USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u30bf\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fUSB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u8a18", "Thinkpad X1 Nano\u306b\u5185\u8535USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u767a\u60f3\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u5185\u8535USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "USB\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u5897\u8a2d\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5185\u306bUSB\u30cf\u30d6\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080"]}

The 2024 Tiny Games Challenge invites you to have the most fun with the most minimal setup. Whether that\u2019s tiny size, tiny parts count, or tiny code, we want you to show us that big fun can come in small packages.\nThe Tiny Games Challenge starts now and runs through September 10th, with the top three entries receiving a $150 gift certificate courtesy of DigiKey.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell you how much fun we\u2019ve had playing Twang and a few derivatives thereof. It\u2019s an amazing amount of fun to get out of just a springy door stopper, an accelerometer, and an LED strip. Pong is an evergreen game, and you might expect to see it implemented on an LED strip, but how about on ten LEDs? Or Snake on a 162 LCD? [Doug McInnes]\u2019s Hunt the Lunpus runs on two seven-segment displays!\nWe\u2019ve seen no end of small handheld game projects, ranging from the Arduboy to [Deshipu]\u2019s outstanding PewPew series of devices. These projects have an incredible degree of finish, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from lashing up a quick pocket gaming platform out of whatever you have on hand.\nOr maybe you want to have fun with the hardware? We\u2019re absolutely interested in seeing the most innovative minimal controls you can come up with. Who knows, you might just invent the next Playdate!\nNo matter whether your game is small in scope, code size, build complexity, or form-factor, if you\u2019ve got a Tiny Game, show us! Head over to Hackaday.io and create a project, use the pull-down menu on the left-hand side to enter, and you\u2019re set. We\u2019ll be judging on simplicity, fun, and the quality of your documentation, and the top three will get a $150 DigiKey shopping spree. Let the (tiny) games begin!\nHonorable Mention Categories\n\nOne Dimensional: Everyone has an LED strip kicking around somewhere. Show us how we can put that to use to make an engaging game that plays only in one dimension.\nThe Classics: You know: Pong, Snake, Tetris, or maybe even Hunt the Wumpus. In this category, we\u2019re looking for modern implementations of a classic tiny game of yesteryear.\nThe Controls: With some games, it\u2019s the controls that make them fun. If your tiny game has innovative user interfaces, this is for you.\nPocket Arcade: You want to bring your games with you everywhere, right? This category is for DIY tiny games that you can carry around every day.\nFancy!: This category is for the polish, the fit-and-finish, and the shininess. If your game looks fantastic, it\u2019s fancy.\n\n \n\n", "title": "2024 Tiny Games Challenge: \u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080", "body": "2024 Tiny Games Challenge\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3092\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u63d0\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u30029\u670810\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6700\u512a\u79c0\u4f5c\u54c1\u306b\u306f$150\u5206\u306eDigiKey\u30ae\u30d5\u30c8\u5238\u304c\u8d08\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002LED strip\u3084\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u3069\u3001\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u5c0f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["2024 Tiny Games Challenge: \u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080", "DIY\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3080", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb: \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u767a\u660e\u3059\u308b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9", "\u4e00\u6b21\u5143\u306eLED\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0: LED\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u4e00\u6b21\u5143\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9: \u6bce\u65e5\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3079\u308bDIY\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea"]}

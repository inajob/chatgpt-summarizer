GCHQ is the nations electronic spying centre, and just to show what a bunch of good eggs they are they release a puzzler every year to titillate the nations geeks. 2024s edition is out if you fancy trying it, so break out your proverbial thinking caps.\nThe puzzle comes in several stages each of which reveals a British landmark, and were told theres a further set of puzzles hidden in the design of the card itself. We know that Hackaday readers possess fine minds, so youll all be raring to have a go.\nSadly GCHQ would for perfectly understandable reasons never let Hackaday in for a tour, but weve encountered some of their past work. First the Colossus replica codebreaking computer at Bletchley Park was the progenitor of the organisation, and then a few years ago when they had an exhibition from their archive in the London Science Museum."}

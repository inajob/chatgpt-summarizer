Its a Linux malware strain aimed squarely at embedded devices. One of the first targets of this malware, surprisingly, is the Iraeli made Orpak gas station pumps. Theres a bit of history here, as IOCONTROL is believed to be used by CyberAv3ngers, a threat actor aligned with Iran. In 2023 a group aligned with Israel claimed to have compromised the majority of the gas stations in Iran. IOCONTROL seems to have been deployed as retribution.\nThere are a few particularly interesting aspects of this malware, and how TEAM82 went about analyzing it. The first is that they used unicorn to emulate the obscure ARM platform in question. This was quite an adventure, as they were running the malicious binary without the normal Linux OS under it, and had to re-implement system calls to make execution work. The actual configuration data was encrypted as the data section of the executable, presumably to avoid simple string matching detection and analysis.\nThen to communicate with the upstream command and control infrastructure, the binary first used DNS-Over-HTTPS to resolve DNS addresses, and then used the MQTT message protocol for actual communications. Once in place, it has the normal suite of capabilities, like code execution, cleanup, lateral scanning, etc. An interesting speculation is that the level of control this malware had over these gas pumps, it was in a position to steal credit card information. This malware family isnt limited to gas pumps, either, as its been spotted in IoT and SCADA devices from a whole host of vendors.\nBit-unlocker\nWe have another attack against TPM backed Bitlocker full disk encryption. The idea here is that by default Bitlocker uses an encryption key provided by the systems Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Unless the user intentionally turns on Bitlocker PIN, this key from the TPM is the only credential needed to decrypt the drive, and is automatically provided at boot time. Weve covered one attack against Bitlocker, where the key is sniffed while its being transferred from the external TPM. The conclusion as of that coverage was that a firmware TPM saves you from this attack, since theres no accessible bus to sniff data from.\nWell. Theres another approach, as you might have guessed. Modern memory requires constant refreshing to not lose its value, but that doesnt mean that its entirely lost immediately. Thats what [Jack Crouse] discovered, and put to work here. Using the reset pins on a motherboard, the system is reset and booted off a flash drive. That drive contains a very minimal EFI application that just reads system memory and dumps it to the flash drive. Because the memory is mostly intact, if you reset the machine at the right point during boot, the memory dump includes the disk encryption key, allowing for easy drive decryption. If nothing else, this should be your queue to add a PIN to your Bitlocker setup. This was also a talk given at 38c3, which is now available!\nStars for Sale\nGitHub stars are a useful way to determine the popularity of a project, and by extension how trustworthy that project is. At least, thats the idea. Like any measure of popularity and trustworthiness, the GitHub Stars system has been gamed. Given how easy it is to create a GitHub account, and that giving out stars is a free action, its not surprising. The research suggested that between 3 and 4.5 million stars were fake, and GitHub has been quite responsive at removing the accounts and stars that are very likely to be inauthentic.\nThe Downside to a Connected Car\nIn a tale that gets worse the more you think about it, its revealed that 800,000 Volkswagen electric vehicles were leaking their precise information history via an unsecured Amazon storage instance. This wasnt explicitly referred to as an S3 bucket, but well use the bucket term for ease of discussion. This was discovered via an unnamed whistleblower, so its unclear whether the bucket name was accidentally made public. Regardless, it was accessible without any authentication. The broader question is why VW needs to keep these records on their drivers. Its the downside to an always connected car.\nHows the Passkey Doing?\n[Dan Goodin] is no stranger to the pages of this column, and he has thoughts about Passkeys. This isnt a vulnerability  the FIDO2 specification hasnt been broken in some new and clever way. Passkeys are still a good, secure way to use a trusted device as an authentication source. The problem is, theyre sort of a pain to use. Say youre using Google Chrome on an Apple device. A site prompts you to create a passkey. Is that passkey managed by Apple, or Google? The answer is, by Apple, unless you explicitly ask Chrome to manage it. And then, Chrome on Mac isnt allowed to sync Passkeys to Chrome on an iPhone.\nAnd those are essentially the two problems with Passkeys: Every vendor wants users to use their platform to store passkeys, and once stored its devilishly difficult to manage and move passkeys to another device/platform. The silver lining is that many password managers can act as a Passkey store, and handle syncing between devices. But then again, theres not much difference between passwords and passkeys, when you use a password manager to handle them.\nDouble-Click-Jack\nAnd in related news, theres a new approach to harvesting unintended clicks. Clickjacking is what happens when a site loads an advertisement at the top of the page, just as youre trying to click on something, and your click gets hijacked to something else. Browsers have added protections to make truly malicious clickjacking harder to pull off. But Doubleclickjacking neatly sidesteps all of them. Its simple: Launch another tab that claims to be a captcha, asking the user to double-click to prove they are human. Close the tab after a single click, and the second click goes to a different window. Its clever and devious, and one more thing to watch out for.\n\nBits and Bytes\nThe US Treasury has reported that it was breached, via the ironically named BeyondTrust remote support vendor. Its reported that this was an APT affiliated with the Chinese government, though very few details are available.\nThe intersection of data scraping and AI writing has led to dangerously good targeted phishing emails. Part of the danger here is that so much of the legitimate emails that spam filters are trained on are also written by LLMs, and executives are so used to that style of message, phishing emails fit right in.\n[Mateusz Jurczyk] has released part five of the Windows Registry deep dive over at Google Project Zero. This installment is all about how the data is actually encoded into the registry files, as well as how those files are loaded and verified.

The machine would encode binary as a series of tones which could be recorded to the tape and then later retrieved. If you consider the last sentence youll quickly realize that its not too far away from what a modem does, so can a modem record to cassette and decode it back afterwards? [Jesse T] set out to give it a try, and as it turns out, yes you can.\nThe modem talks and listens to the cassette recorder via circuitry that provides some signal conditioning and amplification, as well as making a dial tone such that the modem thinks its talking to a real phone line. An Arduino steps in as dial tone creator.\nOf course, this is hardly a viable solution to 21st century data storage need, but thats hardly the point as its a cool hack. We like it, and oddly weve seen a similar technique used with a retrocomputer in the past.\n\n\nThanks [CodeAsm] for the tip!", "title": "- \u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3067\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u9332\u97f3\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u304c\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u9332\u97f3\u30fb\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3067\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u9332\u97f3\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u9332\u97f3\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u6cd5", "- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3068\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

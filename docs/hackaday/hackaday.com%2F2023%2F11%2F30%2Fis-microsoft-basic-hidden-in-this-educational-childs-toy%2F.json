It featured a keyboard and a variety of simple learning games, but does it also feature Microsoft BASIC? [Robin] of 8-Bit Show and Tell dove in to find out.\nOfficially, the PreComputer was programmable in a form of BASIC, referred to by VTech as PRE-BASIC V1.0. Given that the system has a Z80 CPU and theres little information in the manual about this programming language, [Robin] was suspicious as to whether it was based on Microsoft BASIC-80. Thus, an examination was in order to figure out just how this BASIC implementation worked, and whether it shared anything with Microsofts own effort.\nWe wont spoil the conclusions, but there are some strong commonalities between VTechs BASIC and Microsofts version from this era. The variable names in particular are a strong hint as to whats going on under the hood. The video is worth a watch for anyone thats a fan of early microcomputer history, BASIC, or just the weird computer-like devices of yesteryear. We also love the idea that the PreComputer 1000 was actually quite a capable machine hiding behind a single-line LCD display.\n\n", "title": "1988\u5e74\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001VTech PreComputer 1000\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305fMicrosoft BASIC\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8abf\u67fb", "body": "1988\u5e74\u306b\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u53e4\u3044\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u5b66\u7fd2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002Microsoft BASIC\u3068\u5171\u901a\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3092\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u5171\u901a\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5224\u660e\u30021\u884c\u306eLCD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u96a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["1988\u5e74\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001VTech PreComputer 1000\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305fMicrosoft BASIC\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8abf\u67fb", "VTech PreComputer 1000\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6: Microsoft BASIC\u3068\u306e\u5171\u901a\u70b9\u3092\u767a\u898b", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001VTech PreComputer 1000\u306eBASIC\u5b9f\u88c5\u89e3\u6790", "VTech PreComputer 1000\u306eBASIC\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306bMicrosoft BASIC\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3042\u308a\uff1f", "\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001VTech PreComputer 1000\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

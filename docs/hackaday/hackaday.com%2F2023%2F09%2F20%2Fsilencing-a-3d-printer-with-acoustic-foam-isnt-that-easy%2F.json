[Handy Bear] decided to try some simple ways to quieten down their printer using acoustic foam, with mixed results.\nThe video starts by exploring two different acoustic foams; one black, one white. The latter was found to hold a flame when ignited, making it a poor choice for a 3D printer with many hot components. The black foam, advertised for use in automotive installations, was reluctant to burn at all, and so made a safer choice.\nThe UP Mini 3 printer is then disassembled to receive its soundproofing treatment. The printers various panels all got a healthy lashing of thick sticky insulating foam. This took some work, thanks to the need to cut around various ribs and screw bosses on the panels. Cut appropriately, though, the printed was able to be reassembled neatly with its foam hidden inside.\nUnfortunately, the work didnt have a great effect on the printers sound output. Thats perhaps unsurprising, given it still has uninsulated panels like the front window which are still free to radiate sound. The foam did help cut down on fan noise and high-pitch sounds from the printer, but the annoying medium and low pitched noises from the printers motors were still very audible.\nUsing an enclosure or a quieter stepper driver are probably more effective DIY methods to quiet a noisy printer; share your own ideas in the comments. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9a12\u97f3\u3092\u9759\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u9759\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u8a66\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u306f\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3084\u9759\u97f3\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u304c\u3088\u308a\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3060\u3068\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9a12\u97f3\u3092\u9759\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u97f3\u97ff\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u5bfe\u7b56", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u6291\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b", "\u97f3\u97ff\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9759\u97f3\u5316\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u52b9\u679c\u306f\u9650\u5b9a\u7684", "DIY\u3067\u9a12\u97f3\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046"]}

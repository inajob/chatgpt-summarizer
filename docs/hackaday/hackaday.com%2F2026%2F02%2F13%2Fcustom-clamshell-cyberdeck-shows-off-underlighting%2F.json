Its a clamshell-style cyberdeck with custom split keyboard, trackpad, optional external WiFi antenna, and some slick underlighting thanks to a translucent bottom shell. Theres even a hidden feature that seems super handy for a cyberdeck: a special USB-C port that, when plugged in to another host (like another computer), lets the cyberdeck act as an external keyboard and trackpad for that downstream machine.\nThe CM Deck is built around the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, which necessitates a custom PCB but offers more design freedom.\nNotably, the CM Deck is custom-built around the Raspberry Pi Compute Model 5. When we first peeped the CM5 the small size was striking, but of course that comes at the cost of having no connectors, supporting hardware, or heat management. Thats something [Salim] embraced because it meant being able to put connectors exactly where he wanted them, and not have to work around existing hardware. A custom PCB let him to lay out his cyberdeck with greater freedom, less wasted space, and ultimately integrate a custom-built keyboard (with RP2040 and QMK firmware).\nEven the final enclosure is custom-made, with 3D printing being used to validate the design and PCBway providing finished plastic shells in addition to manufacturing the PCBs. [Salim] admits that doing so was an indulgence, but his delight at the quality of the translucent purple undercarriage is palpable.\n[Salim]s video (embedded below) is a deep dive into the whole design and build process, and its a great watch for anyone interested in the kind of work and decisions that go into making something like this. Experienced folks can expect to nod in sympathy when [Salim] highlights gotchas like doing CAD work based on the screens drawings, only to discover later that the physical unit doesnt quite match.\nThe GitHub repository contains the design files for everything, so give it a browse if youre interested. [Salim] is no stranger to clean builds, so take a moment to admire his CRT-style Raspberry Pi terminal as well.\n\n\nThanks [Keith Olson] for sharing the tip!", "title": "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3068Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308bCM\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Salim\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305fCM Deck\u306f\u3001Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3002\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3068Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308bCM\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\uff01\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068USB-C\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- CAD\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u7a74\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5b9f\u969b\uff1aCM\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6559\u8a13"]}

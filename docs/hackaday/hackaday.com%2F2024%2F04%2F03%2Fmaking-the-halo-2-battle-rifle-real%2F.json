This BR55 rifle built by [B Squared Mfg] not only looks exactly like its in-game Halo 2 counterpart, its also a fully functional firearm chambered in 5.56. The attention to detail even brings us a game-accurate electronic ammo counter.\nThe rifle and magazine communicate over three pins.\nUnfortunately, the only information we have on the weapon currently is the video below. But he does at least go into detail about the practical aspects: caliber choice, the arduous journey of bolt carrier sourcing, and how the ammo counter works.\nEach magazine has a potentiometer built into it to detect the number of rounds loaded, but theres a bit of trickery involved. In the real world, theres no way a magazine this size could hold the 30 rounds of ammunition depicted in the game, so for each shot fired, the counter subtracts three. It takes a little imagination, but this way it looks as close to the game version as possible.\nThere will be no published files due to legal concerns, but theres nothing you couldnt build yourself, as long as said legal concerns are sorted out for yourself. Depending on where you live, you might have to settle for building a Gauss gun in the same frame, weve even seen slimmer ones done commercially. Whatever you build, make sure you store it in a way others cant access it easily  not all gun safes pass this test.\n\n\nWe thank [Arsenio] for sharing this with us in the Hackaday Discord server!", "title": "Halo 2\u306e\u9283\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u7684\u5f3e\u85ac\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u642d\u8f09", "body": "Halo 2\u306eBR55\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u9283\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u88c5\u7f6e\u4ed8\u304d\u30675.56\u5f3e\u3092\u6483\u3066\u308b\u307b\u304b\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5f3e\u85ac\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3082\u5fe0\u5b9f\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3002\u5f3e\u5009\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u5f0f\u3067\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5f3e\u6570\u3092\u53cd\u6620\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3002\u30d1\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3055\u308c\u305a\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306f\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Halo 2\u306e\u9283\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u7684\u5f3e\u85ac\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u642d\u8f09", "\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bBR55\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb\u88fd\u4f5c\uff01", "Halo 2\u306e\u9283\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bHalo 2\u306eBR55\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7248\u306b\u5fe0\u5b9f\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5f3e\u85ac\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb"]}

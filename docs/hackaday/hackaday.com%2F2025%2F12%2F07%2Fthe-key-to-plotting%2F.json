Today, many printers can get high enough resolution with dots that drawing things with a pen isnt as necessary as it once was. But certainly youve at least seen or heard of machines that would draw graphics using a pen. Most of them were conceptually like a 3D printer with a pen instead of a hotend and no real Z-axis. But as [biosrhythm] reminds us, some plotters were suspiciously like\u00a0typewriters fitted with pens.\nInstead of type bars, type balls, or daisy wheels, machines like the Panasonic Penwriter used a pen to draw your text on the page, as you can see in the video below. Some models had direct computer control via a serial port, if you wanted to plot using software. At least one model included a white pen so you could cover up any mistakes.\nIf you didnt have a computer, the machine had its own way to input data for graphs. How did that work? Read for yourself.\n\nPanasonic wasnt the only game in town, either. Silver Reed  a familiar name in old printers  had a similar model that could connect via a parallel port. Other familiar names are Smith Corona, Brother, Sharp, and Sears.\nSince all the machines take the same pens, they probably have very similar insides. According to the post, Alps was the actual manufacturer of the internal plotting mechanism, at least.\nThe video doesnt show it, but the machines would draw little letters just as well as graphics. Maybe better since you could change font sizes and shapes without switching a ball. They could even type vertically or at an angle, at least with external software.\nSince plotters are, at heart, close to 3D printers, it is pretty easy to build one these days. If plotting from keystrokes is too mundane for you, try voice control.\n"}

We asked you to show us your best tiny game, whether that means tiny hardware, tiny code, or a tiny BOM, and you did so in spades. Congratulations to all the winners and Honorable Mentions, and thanks to DigiKey, Supplyframe, and all who entered!\nWe also announced the first round of Supercon speakers, so if you havent gotten your ticket yet, nows the second best time.\nBut wait, theres more! Were already a few weeks into the next contest, where we want you to show us your best Simple Supercon Add-On. We love to see the add-ons people make for the badge every year, so this time around were really embracing the standard. The best SAOs will get a production run and theyll be in the swag bag at Hackaday Europe 2025.\nThen its on to Whats That Sound, which completely stumped Kristina once again. Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nNow its on to the hacks, beginning with non-planar ironing for smooth prints, and a really neat business card that also plays tiny games. Then well discuss USB modems, cool casts for broken wrists, and archiving data on paper. Finally, we ask two big questions  where do you connect the shield, and whats the Next Big Thing gonna be? Inquiring minds want to know.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 289 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2024 Hackaday Superconference Speakers, Round One\nSupercon 2024: May The Best Badge Add-Ons Win\n\nDiscord\n\n\nMeet The Winners Of The 2024 Tiny Games Contest\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nKnow that sound?

As things stand, there is hope that Haier Europe may relent, especially as the companys US division has shown no inclinations to join in on the original CD.\nIn the confusion following the initial CD announcement demanding the take-down of [Andre]s hOn-related repositories, it was not clear to many which Haier was involved. As it turns out, Haier Europe as a separately legal entity apparently decided to go on this course alone, with Haier US distancing themselves from the issue. In that same Reddit thread its noted that GE Appliances (part of Haier US) has had a local API available for years. This makes Haier Europe the odd one out, even as theyre attempting some damage control now.\nAmidst this whirlwind of developments, we hope that Haier Europe can indeed reach an amicable solution with the community, whether its continued API usage, or the development of a local API.", "title": "Home Assistant\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u548c\u89e3\u306e\u7533\u3057\u51fa", "body": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306b\u6297\u8b70\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5bfe\u8a71\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u7c73\u56fd\u90e8\u9580\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306b\u95a2\u4e0e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u306e\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u90e8\u9580\u304c\u73fe\u5728\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Home Assistant\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u548c\u89e3\u306e\u7533\u3057\u51fa", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u3068\u306e\u5bfe\u8a71\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u8005", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30ebUS\u306f\u554f\u984c\u304b\u3089\u8ddd\u96e2\u3092\u7f6e\u304f\u4e2d\u3001\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u304c\u5bfe\u8a71\u3092\u958b\u59cb", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u306e\u5408\u610f\u3092\u6a21\u7d22", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306eAPI\u5229\u7528\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8b70\u8ad6\u304c\u9032\u5c55"]}

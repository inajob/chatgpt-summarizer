Both the old and new altimeters have a dial on the front for calibrating the meter. The electronic altimeter has a connector on the back for integrating with the rest of the airplane. [Ben] notes that this particular electronic altimeter is only a backup in the airplane it is installed in, its there for a second opinion or in case of emergency.\n\nThe back of the electronic altimeter has a 26-pin connector. The documentation \u2014 the User Guide for MD23-215 Multifunction Digital Counter Drum Altimeter \u2014 explains the pinout. The signals of interest are ARINC Out A  B (a differential pair on pins 2 and 3) and ARINC In A  B (a differential pair on pins 5 and 14).\nHere ARINC refers to the ARINC 429 protocol which is a serial protocol for communicating between systems in aircraft. Essentially the protocol transmits labeled values with some support for error detection. The rest of the video is spent investigating these ARINC signals in detail, both in the specification and via the oscilloscope.\nOf course weve heard from [Ben Eater] many times before, see Ben Eater Vs. Microsoft BASIC and [Ben Eater]\u2019s Breadboarding Tips for some examples.\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u30d9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u65e7\u5f0f\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u3092\u4ee3\u66ff\u3057\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u6a5f\u80fd\u3042\u308a\u3002ARINC 429\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8aac\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- ARINC 429\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u306e\u89e3\u6790", "- \u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\uff1a\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- oscilloscope\u3067\u63a2\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8a08\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7", "- Ben Eater\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226"]}

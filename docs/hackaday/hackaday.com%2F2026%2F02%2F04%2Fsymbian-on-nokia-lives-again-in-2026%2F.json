Dead and gone, you might think, but even they have dedicated enthusiasts here in 2026. Some of them have gone so far as to produce a new ROM for the daddy of Symbian phones, the Nokia N8, and [Janus Cycle] is giving it a spin.\nFor many people, the smartphone era began when the first Apple iPhones and Android devices reached the market, but the smartphone itself can be traced back almost two decades earlier to an IBM device. In the few years before the birth of todays platforms many people even had smartphones without quite realizing what they had, because Nokia, the market leader in the 2000s, failed to make their Symbian platform user friendly in the way that Apple did. The N8 was their attempt to produce an iPhone competitor, but its lack of an on-device app store and that horrific Windows-based installation system meant it would be their last mass-market flagship before falling down the Microsoft Windows Phone rabbit hole.\nIn the video below the break he takes a pair of N8s and assembles one with that beautiful camera fully working, before installing the new ROM and giving it a spin. We get to see at last what the N8 could have been but wasnt, as it gains the last Symbian release from Nokia, and the crucial missing app store. Even fifteen years later its a very slick device, enough to make us sorry that this ROM wont be made for the earlier N-series sitting in a drawer where this is being written. We salute its developers for keeping the N8 alive.\nOddly, this isnt the only Nokia from that era thats received a little 2020s love.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a2N8\u306e\u65b0ROM\u958b\u767a\uff1a\u30b7\u30f3\u30d3\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "Nokia N8\u306e\u65b0ROM\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u65e7\u5f0f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u547d\u3092\u5439\u304d\u8fbc\u3080\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a2N8\u306e\u65b0ROM\u958b\u767a\uff1a\u30b7\u30f3\u30d3\u30a2\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30ce\u30ad\u30a2\u304b\u3089iPhone\u3078", "- \u30ce\u30ad\u30a2N8\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u3082\u3064\u3044\u3066\u9032\u5316", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3078\u306e\u60c5\u71b1\uff1a2026\u5e74\u306e\u30ce\u30ad\u30a2\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3", "- \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8996\u70b9\u3067\u898b\u308b\u30ce\u30ad\u30a2N8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u9b45\u529b"]}

We say it all depends on how you build the thing, and how you program it. Would you believe that the MagiClick by [Modular] is capable of showing live weather information or the date and time, acting as animated dice, or being a stopwatch and Pomodoro timer? Now youre beginning to understand.\nBefore we get much further, yes, this bad boy has two additional buttons on the sides. But the spirit of the thing is in the single large switch in the middle. Its hiding beneath the 0.85 128128 display, which is protected from pressure and fingerprints by that Pop-o-Matic bubble over the top. While the big button is the main operator used to access the function options, the side buttons are used as auxiliaries to exit and return to the home screen.\nMagiClick is based on the ESP32-S3 and is designed to run on CircuitPython. In addition to everything else packed into this thing, there are blinkenlights and a small speaker inside, plus a GPIO expansion header around back. Everything is available on GitHub if you want to build your own.\nNot enough keys for you? Well, heres one with two.", "title": "\u300cMagiClick\u300d\uff1a\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "MagiClick\u306f\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u5358\u4e00\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3001\u5929\u6c17\u60c5\u5831\u3084\u6642\u523b\u8868\u793a\u3001\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30ed\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3001\u30dd\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ed\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002ESP32-S3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001CircuitPython\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002GitHub\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cMagiClick\u300d\uff1a\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\u300d\uff1aESP32-S3\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eMagiClick\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "\u300c\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u6e80\u8f09\u300d\uff1a\u5929\u6c17\u60c5\u5831\u8868\u793a\u3084\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u5099\u3048\u305fMagiClick\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "\u300c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\uff1aMagiClick\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u597d\u307f\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u300c2\u3064\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u3055\u3089\u306b\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u300d\uff1a\u62e1\u5f35\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fMagiClick\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u3055\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

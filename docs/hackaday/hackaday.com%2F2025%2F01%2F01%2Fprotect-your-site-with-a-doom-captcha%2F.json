The 1993 first person shooter from id Software defined an entire genre of games, and has since been made open source, appearing on almost everything. Everything, that is, except a Captcha, those annoying Are you a human tests where were all expected to do a search giants image classification for them. So heres [Guillermo Rauch] with a DOOM\u00a0captcha, in which you must gun down three bad guys to proceed.\nAs a way to prove youre a human we cant imagine a more fitting test than indiscriminate slaughter, and its interesting to read a little about what goes on behind the scenes. Its a WebAssembly application as you might have guessed, and while its difficult to shake that idea from the early 90s that you needed a powerful computer to run the game, in reality it shows just how powerful WebAssembly is, as well as how far weve come in three decades.\nWed prefer a few different entry points instead of always playing the same level, and we were always more handy with the mouse than the keyboard back in the day, but its certainly a bit of fun. Its worth noting that simply playing the game isnt enough to verify your humanity  if youre killed in the game before vanquishing the required three foes, youll have to start over. As the game is running at Nightmare difficulty, proving your worth might be a tad harder than youd expect\nNeed more DOOM? How about seeing it on hardware nobody would have believed in 1993?", "title": "- DOOM\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\uff1a\u4eba\u9593\u3092\u8a3c\u660e\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "DOOM\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fCaptcha\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u4eba\u9593\u8a3c\u660e\u306b\u306a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3068\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- DOOM\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\uff1a\u4eba\u9593\u3092\u8a3c\u660e\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3067\u52d5\u304fDOOM\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3092\u611f\u3058\u308b", "- \u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\u3067\u306eDOOM\uff1a\u4eba\u9593\u6027\u3092\u8a66\u3059\u6311\u6226", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5922\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305fDOOM\u4f53\u9a13", "- 1993\u5e74\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u308b\uff1aDOOM\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u767a\u5c55"]}

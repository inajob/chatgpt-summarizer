In particular, about how devilishly well designed it is for extensibility. It\u2019s designed to be added on to, and that makes all of the difference.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s trivial to add your own wacky control or sensor elements to the system, but that it\u2019s relatively straightforward, and that it accommodates you. If your use case isn\u2019t already covered, there is probably good documentation available to help guide you in the right direction, and that\u2019s all a hacker really needs. As evidence for why you might care, take the RTL-HAOS project that we covered this week, which adds nearly arbitrary software-defined radio functionality to your setup.\nAnd contrast this with many commercial systems that are hard to hack on because they are instead focused on making sure that the least-common-denominator user is able to get stuff working without even reading a single page of documentation. They are so focused on making everything that\u2019s in-scope easy that they spend no thought on expansion, or worse they actively prevent it.\nOf course, it\u2019s not trivial to make a system that\u2019s both extremely flexible and relatively easy to use. We all know examples where the configuration of even the most basic cases is a nightmare simply because the designer wanted to accommodate everything. Somehow, Home Assistant has managed to walk the fine line in the middle, where it\u2019s easy enough to use that you don\u2019t have to be a wizard, but that you can make it do what you want if you are, and hence it got spontaneous hat-tips from both Al and myself. Food for thought if you\u2019re working on a complex system that\u2019s aimed at the DIY / hacker crowd.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

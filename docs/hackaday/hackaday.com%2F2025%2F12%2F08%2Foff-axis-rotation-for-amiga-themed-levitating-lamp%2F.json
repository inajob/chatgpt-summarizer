Floating light bulbs, globes, you name it. After the initial craze of expensive desk toys, a wave of cheap kits became available from the usual suspects. [RobSmithDev] wanted to make a commemorative lamp for the Amigas 40th anniversary, but it was missing something. Sure, the levitating red-and-white boing ball looked good, but in the famous demo, the ball is spinning at a jaunty angle. You cant do that with mag-lev not without a hack, anyway.\n\nThe hack [RobSmith] decided on is quite simple: the levitator is working in the usual manner, but rather than mount his boing ball directly to the magnet, the magnet is glued to a Dalek-lookalike plinth. The plinth holds a small motor, which is mounted at an angle to the base. Since the base stays vertical, the motors shaft provides the jaunty angle for the 3D-printed boing balls rotation. The motor is powered by the same coil that came with the kit to power the LEDs indeed, the original LEDs are reused. An interesting twist is that the inductor alone was not able to provide enough power to run even the motor by itself: [Rob] had to add a capacitor to tune the LC circuit to the ~100 kHz frequency of the base coil. While needing to tune an antenna shouldnt be any sort of surprise, neither we nor [Rob] were thinking of this as an antenna, so it was a neat detail to learn.\nWith the hard drive-inspired base  which eschews insets for self-tapping screws  the resulting lamp makes a lovely homage to the Amiga Computer in its 40th year.\nWeve seen these mag-lev modules before, but the effect is always mesmerizing.\u00a0 Of course, if you want to skip the magnets, you can still pretend to levitate a lamp with tensegrity. \n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3046\u6d6e\u904a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u8a18\u5ff5\u3057\u305f\u6d6e\u304f\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u50be\u3051\u3066\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3046\u6d6e\u904a\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30de\u30b0\u30ec\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u6d6e\u904a\u7403\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u9b45\u305b\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5b66\u3076LC\u56de\u8def\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u30c6\u30f3\u30bb\u30b0\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u6d6e\u904a\u611f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

But sometimes youre stuck in the middle: you need more computational muscle than the average SBC can bring to the table, but at the same time, a full-size computer isnt going to work for you.\nLuckily, we now have options such as the LattePanda Mu powered by Intels quad-core N100 processor. Put a pair of these modules (with their associated carrier boards) on your desktop, and youve got considerable number-crunching capabilities in a relatively small package. Thanks to [Jay Doscher] weve got a slick 3D printed rack that can keep them secure and cool, complete with the visual flair that weve come to expect from his creations.\n\nWhile you might be able to get away with leaving a Raspberry Pi naked on your workbench while it hosts your MQTT server, Mini-ITX boards like the LattePanda Mu carriers used in this project need a bit more protection. Even if you didnt want to print out the whole rack, you could run off just one of the individual Compute Unit cases that [Jay] has designed and made freely available. Complete with stylish handle, the brutalist box will do nicely to keep gerfingerpoken und mittengraben at a minimum.\nBut if you do have a pair of these x86 beauties at your disposal, going all the way and printing the skeletonized rack the cases lock into looks like it would be well worth the investment of time and filament. The open design and 140 mm Noctua fan mounted in the bottom keeps airflow at a maximum, to the point that [Jay] says he doesnt even need to run individual fans on the LattePanda boards.\nThis design is something of an evolution of the N100 Obelisk that [Jay] created back in May, which was able to hold more mini computers and used a more chimney-like approach to heat management. Though you can start to see the origins of his unique visual style, which combines sci-fi and militaristic elements, much earlier than that.", "title": "ARM\u3068Intel\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLattePanda Mu\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u306a\u3069\u306eARM\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u826f\u304f\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u305f\u3044\u3068\u304d\u306b\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u6642\u306b\u306f\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u306aSBC\u3067\u306f\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u3067\u3001LattePanda Mu\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6d77\u5916\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8005\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["ARM\u3068Intel\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLattePanda Mu\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u52b9\u7387\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u6027\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u306eARM\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "Jay Doscher\u306b\u3088\u308bLattePanda Mu\u75283D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "LattePanda Mu\u306eCompute Unit\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u9ad8\u3044\u4fdd\u8b77\u80fd\u529b\u3068\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "x86\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306eLattePanda Mu\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30b1\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u51b7\u5374\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

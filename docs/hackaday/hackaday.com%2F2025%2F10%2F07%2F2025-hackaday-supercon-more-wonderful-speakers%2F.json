SJ Jones is an additive manufacturing solutions engineer and nobody knows metal printing for intense applications like they do. In this discussion they\u2019ll be talking with designer and 3D printing expert Allie Katz about computational design, artful engineering, and 3D prints that can survive a rocket trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavis DeWitt\nMovie Magic and the Value of Practical Effects\nWhat does it take to create something that\u2019s never been seen before? In film and TV, special effects must not only work, but also feel alive. This talk explores how blending hardware hacking with art creates functional and emotional storytelling, from explosive stunts to robots with personality, these projects blur the lines between disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Eiche\nThe Magic of Electropermanent Magnets!\nElectropermanent magnets are like magic, an electromagnet but permanently switchable with a bit of current and a few microseconds. Aaron shares the adventures in using cheap off-the-shelf components to build his own and how to make them work empirically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFangzheng Liu\nCircuitScout: Probing PCBs the Easy Way\nDebugging PCBs can be challenging and time-consuming. This talk dives into the open-source DIY project, CircuitScout. This small desktop machine system automates debugging by selecting pads from your schematic, locating them, and controlling a probe machine for safe, hands-free testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Needleman\nFrom Sunlight to Silicon\nAI workloads consume significant energy, but what if it didnt? This hands-on session shows how to design and run a solar-powered computer cluster, focusing on NVIDIA Jetson Orin hardware, efficient power pipelines, and software strategies for high performance under tight energy limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Duffy\nThe Circuits Behind Your Multimeter\nEveryone uses a multimeter, but do you know what\u2019s inside? This talk explores the inner workings, plus insights from building one, the design choices, and the tradeoffs behind common models. Discover the hidden engineering that makes this everyday tool accurate, safe, and reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Martin\nDIY Depth: Shooting and Printing 3D Images\n3D photography isn\u2019t just for vintage nerds or high-end tech! Learn how stereoscopic film cameras work, the mechanics of lenticular lenses and how to print convincing 3D images at home, plus dive into digitizing, aligning, and processing 3D images from analog sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay Antoniak\nFrom bytes to bobbins: Driving an embroidery machine\nThis talk explores how an embroidery machine brings out the best of tinkering: production, customization, and creative hacks. Learn how to run your first job on that dusty makerspace machine, create your own patch using open-source tools, and see what extra capabilities lie beyond the basics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Penney\nGhostbus: Simpler CSR Handling in Verilog\nDesigning FPGA applications means wrangling CSRs and connecting busses, a tedious  error-prone task.

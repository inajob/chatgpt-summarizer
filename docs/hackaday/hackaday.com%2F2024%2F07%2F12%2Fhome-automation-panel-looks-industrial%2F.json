A modern computer looks dull compared to, say, an IBM 360. Control rooms now look no different than a stock trading room, instead of being full of indicators, knobs, and buzzers. [BorisDigital] must have some of those same feelings. He built a very cool control panel for his Home Assistant setup. He based it somewhat on a jet cockpit and a little on a nuclear plant control room, and the result, as you can see in the video below, is great.\nThis is less of a how-to video and more of an inspirational one. After all, you wont have the same setup, but there are many details about how it was constructed with a Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, and control of the Home Assistant via web services.\n\nYou might point out that you could put everything on a computer screen, but what fun is that? There is a touchscreen, so you do have some options. Normally, the panel hangs on the wall, but you can snap feet on to rest the panel on a desk or table.\nThe panel has about 50 I/O devices, so a GPIO expander  actually several of them  was necessary. To make a nice-looking label, he fills in 3D-printed inset text with spackle. It isnt perfect, but it looks good enough.\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u6280\u8853\u306f\u9032\u6b69\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u3002[BorisDigital]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u306eHome Assistant\u306b\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u3068\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002Raspberry Pi\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3001Web\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u306e\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8\u98a8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "\u8fd1\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u304b\u3089\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3078\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "Raspberry Pi\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "50\u306eI/O\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6709\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

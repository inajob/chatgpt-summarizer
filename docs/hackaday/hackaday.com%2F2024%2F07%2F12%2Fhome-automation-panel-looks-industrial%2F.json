A modern computer looks dull compared to, say, an IBM 360. Control rooms now look no different than a stock trading room, instead of being full of indicators, knobs, and buzzers. [BorisDigital] must have some of those same feelings. He built a very cool control panel for his Home Assistant setup. He based it somewhat on a jet cockpit and a little on a nuclear plant control room, and the result, as you can see in the video below, is great.\nThis is less of a how-to video and more of an inspirational one. After all, you wont have the same setup, but there are many details about how it was constructed with a Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, and control of the Home Assistant via web services.\n\nYou might point out that you could put everything on a computer screen, but what fun is that? There is a touchscreen, so you do have some options. Normally, the panel hangs on the wall, but you can snap feet on to rest the panel on a desk or table.\nThe panel has about 50 I/O devices, so a GPIO expander  actually several of them  was necessary. To make a nice-looking label, he fills in 3D-printed inset text with spackle. It isnt perfect, but it looks good enough.\n"}

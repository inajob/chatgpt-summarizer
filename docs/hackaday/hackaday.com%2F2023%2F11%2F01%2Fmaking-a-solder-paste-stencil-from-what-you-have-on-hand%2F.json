Such a situation arose at the RevSpace hacker space in Den Haag, Netherlands, as they were the assembly venue for a conference badge.\nTheir problem was that the badge PCB had no solder paste stencil, and the solution was to laser cut one out of an unexpected material. The backing paper for self-adhesive vinyl sheet has properties not unlike those desired of a stencil, so they tried laser-cutting one from that material. The result was a robust stencil that outperformed the Mylar they had previously used, enabled the manufacture of 350 boards.\nThey think that the polymer layer on top of the paper may be silicone, and found that the laser didnt unduly melt the edges of the cut. Were not sure wed feed random unknown plastics into our cutter, were guessing they have good quality ventilation. Its mounted into a plywood jig in much the same way as a conventional stencil might be.\nThe badges were destined for WICCON, a Dutch conference from an organisation for women in cybersecurity. Sadly weve not seen a completed one so were not sure what it does, however were pleased to hear they were completed before the event. Thats a hurdle all badge designers will know well.\nLong term readers may remember, that RevSpace have something of a history when it comes to assembling badges.", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u540c\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb", "body": "RevSpace\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u3001\u4f1a\u8b70\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u4f1a\u5834\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306ePCB\u306b\u306f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u304c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u81ea\u5df1\u7c98\u7740\u30d3\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4e0b\u6577\u304d\u304c\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u88fd\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f350\u679a\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305fMylar\u3092\u4e0a\u56de\u308b\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u5805\u7262\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u524d\u306b\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306f\u559c\u3070\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002RevSpace\u306f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u305d\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u540c\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb", "\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4f1a\u8b70\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u3067\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u88cf\u6280", "\u5973\u6027\u5411\u3051\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u4f1a\u8b70\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

Most of us also know that there are a huge variety of materials that can be FDM printed, but theres one which perhaps evades us: you cant load a spool of metal wire into your printer and print in metal, or at least you cant yet. Its something [Rotoforge] is working on, with a project to make a hot end that can melt metal. Their starting point is a ceramic diesel engine glow plug, from which they expect 1300 C (2372 F).\nThe video below the break deals with the process of converting the glow plug, which mostly means stripping off the metal parts which make it a glow plug, and then delicately EDM drilling a hole through its ceramic tip. The video is well worth a watch for the in-depth examination of how they evolved the means to do this.\nSadly they arent at the point of printing metal with this thing, but we think the current progress is impressive enough to have a good chance of working. Definitely one to watch.\nPrevious metal 3D printers weve featured have often used a MIG welder.\n\n\nThanks [theFinn] for the tip!", "title": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u6eb6\u304b\u3057\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u958b\u767a\u4e2d", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u304c\u9032\u5316\u4e2d\u3002[Rotoforge]\u304c\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u6eb6\u304b\u3059\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u3001\u9032\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u6eb6\u304b\u3057\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u958b\u767a\u4e2d", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u7cf8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u5370\u5237\u3078\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u5370\u5237\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u671f\u5f85"]}

However, it was also very boring and error-prone. In fact, wed say it was less instructional to do the typing than it was to do the debugging required to find all your mistakes. Magazines hated that and, as [Tech Tangents] shows us in a recent video, there were efforts to make devices that could scan barcodes from magazines or books to save readers from typing in the latest Star Trek game or Tiny Basic compiler.\nThe Cauzin Softstrip was a simple scanner that could read barcodes from a magazine or your printer if you wanted to do backups. As [Tech Tangents] points out, you may not have heard of it, but at the time, it seemed to be the future of software distribution.\n\nWe were impressed that [Tech Tangent] had enough old magazines that he had some of the original strips. Byte Magazine had tried to promote a similar format, but there was no hardware made to read those barcodes.\nOf course, there were other systems. For example, the HP-41C famously had a barcode scanner, although creating your own was clunky unless you reverse-engineered the proper format (which was done). The basic hardware used there also worked with Bytes format, but you still had to interface the odd scanner to your computer.\nCauzin sidestepped all this with their product, which was simple-to-interface hardware with software support for the major platforms. However, by the time it was on the market, cheap magnetic media and modem-based bulletin boards were destroying interest in loading software from paper.\nThis is a great look at an almost forgotten technology. You could probably build something modern to scan these if you had the urge. These days, it would be easy enough to design your own system. Modern laser printers would probably make very dense barcodes.\nWe wouldnt suggest making a Cauzin guitar, though. These days we have QR codes and even colorful barcodes.\n", "title": "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u300d", "body": "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u304b\u308980\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u3001\u96d1\u8a8c\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u5165\u529b\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u9000\u5c48\u3067\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u591a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002Cauzin Softstrip\u306f\u3001\u96d1\u8a8c\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u306f\u81f3\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u300d", "\u300c1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u6559\u80b2\uff1a\u96d1\u8a8c\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u5165\u529b\u300d", "\u300cCauzin Softstrip\uff1a\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u914d\u4fe1\u306e\u672a\u6765\u300d", "\u300c\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "\u300c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff1a\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d"]}

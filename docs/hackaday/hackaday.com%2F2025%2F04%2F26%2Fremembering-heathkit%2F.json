[Ham Radio Gizmos] takes us all through the story.\nIn case you dont remember, Heathkit produced everything from shortwave radios to color TVs to test equipment and even computers. But, for the most part, when you bought something from them, you didnt get a finished product. You got a bag full of parts and truly amazing instructions about how to put them together. Why? Well, if you are reading Hackaday, you probably know why. But some people did it to learn more about electronics. Others were attracted by the lower prices you paid for some things if you built them yourself. Others just liked the challenge.\nBut Heathkits original kit wasnt electronic at all. It was an airplane kit. Not a model airplane, it was an actual airplane. Edward Heath sold airplane kits at the affordable price around $1,000. In 1926, that was quite a bit of money, but apparently still less than a commercial airplane.\n\nSadly, Heath took off in a test plane in 1931, crashed, and died. The company struggled to survive until 1935, when Howard Anthony bought the company and moved it to the familiar Benton Harbor address. The company still made aircraft kits.\nDuring World War II, the company mobilized to produce electronic parts for wartime aircraft. After the war, the government disposed of surplus, and Howard Anthony casually put in a low bid on some. He won the bid and was surprised to find out the lot took up five rail cars. Among the surplus were some five-inch CRTs used in radar equipment. This launched the first of Heathkits oscilloscopes  the O1. At $39.50, it was a scope people could afford, as long as they could build it. The O-series scopes would be staples in hobby workshops for many years.\nTheres a lot more in the video. Well worth the twenty minutes. If youve never seen a Heathkit manual, definitely check out the one in the video. They were amazing. Or download a couple. No one creates instructions like this anymore.\nIf you watch the video, be warned, there will be a quiz, so pay attention. But heres a hint: theres no right answer for #3. We keep hearing that someone owns the Heathkit brand now, and there have been a few new products. But, at least so far, it hasnt really been the same.", "title": "\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8d77\u6e90\u3068\u6b74\u53f2  ", "body": "Heathkit\u306f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u4f01\u696d\u3067\u3001\u5143\u3005\u306f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u8ca9\u58f2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8d77\u6e90\u3068\u6b74\u53f2  ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u305f\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u88fd\u54c1  ", "\u521d\u4ee3\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3060\u3063\u305f\uff01  ", "\u6226\u6642\u4e2d\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u8a95\u751f  ", "\u30d2\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u304c\u6301\u3064\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f"]}

No Problem!", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2025/08/31/microsoft-removed-wmr-headset-support-no-problem/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OASIS-WMR-driver.png", "original_content": "In late 2024 Microsoft removed support for WMR (Windows Mixed Reality), and they didnt just cease development. As of Windows 11 version 24H2, headsets like the HP Reverb and others by Acer, Samsung, Lenovo, and Dell stopped working at all. But the good news is developer [Matthieu Bucchianeri] created the Oasis driver for Windows Mixed Reality which allows WMR headsets (and their controllers) to work again.\nOasis is available as a free download from Steam and involves a few specific setup steps in order to get working, but once the headset and controllers are unlocked and room setup is complete, the hardware will be usable again. Note that while SteamVR is handy, ones headset and controllers are not actually tied to SteamVR. Any VR application that uses OpenVR or OpenXR should work.\nIts an extremely well-documented project, and anyone willing to read and follow a short list of directions should be off to the races in no time.\nNow that theres a way for folks to dust off their WMR hardware and get back in the game, its a good time to mention that if you have ever suffered from VR sickness, weve covered ways to help deal with and adapt to it."}

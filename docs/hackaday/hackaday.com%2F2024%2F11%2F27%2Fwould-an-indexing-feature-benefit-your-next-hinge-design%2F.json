The whole video is worth a watch, but he shows off the experimental design at the 7:47 mark. The hinge can swing normally but when positioned just right, the squared-off pin within slots into a tapered track, locking the part in place.\nInspired by a handheld shopping basket with a lockable handle, [Angus] worked out a design of his own and demonstrates it with a small GoPro tripod whose legs can fold and lock in place. He admits its a demonstration of the concept more than a genuinely useful tripod, but it does show whats possible with some careful design. Being entirely 3D printed in a single piece and requiring no additional hardware is awfully nice.\n3D printing is very well-suited to this sort of thing, and its worth playing to a printers strengths to do for pennies what one would otherwise need dollars to accomplish.\nWant some tips on designing things in a way that take full advantage of what a 3D printer can achieve? Check out printing enclosures at an angle with minimal supports, leveraging the living hinge to print complex shapes flat (and fold them up for assembly), or even print a one-piece hinge that can actually withstand a serious load. All of those are full of tips, so keep them in mind the next time you design a part.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30b7\u30b4\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u307e\u3068\u3081", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u8ffd\u52a0\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30b7\u30b4\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u307e\u3068\u3081", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8", "- \u8ffd\u52a0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u4e00\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u3067\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u8010\u8377\u91cd\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8"]}

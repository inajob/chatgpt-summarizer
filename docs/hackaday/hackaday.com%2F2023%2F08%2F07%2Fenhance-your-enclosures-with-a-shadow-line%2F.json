Essentially, one half of the part has a slight underbite of a rim, and the other half has a slight overbite, with a bit of a standoff between the two. When placed together, the combination helps parts self-locate to one another, as well as providing a consistent appearance around the mating surfaces.\nWhy is this necessary? When a plastic part is made  such as an enclosure in two halves  the resulting surfaces are never truly flat. Without post-processing, the two not-quite-flat surfaces result in an inconsistent line with a varying gap between them.\nBy designing in a shadow line,\u00a0the two parts will not only self-locate to each other for assembly, but will appear as a much more consistent fit. There will be a clear line between the two parts, but no actual visible gaps between them. Watch the whole thing explained in the video, embedded below.\nThis isnt the only time design techniques from the world of injection molding have migrated to 3D printing. Crush ribs have been adapted to the world of 3D printed parts and are a tried-and-true solution to the problem of reliably obtaining a tight fit between plastic parts and hardware inserts.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u6280\u6cd5\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8907\u6570\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u969b\u306b\u3001\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u540c\u58eb\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5408\u308f\u305b\u304c\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u308a\u3001\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u3082\u4e00\u8cab\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30d6\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u6280\u6cd5\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5f71\u7dda\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u52b9\u679c", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u5df1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5408\u308f\u305b\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u6280\u6cd5\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3082\u9069\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u7406\u7531", "\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831"]}

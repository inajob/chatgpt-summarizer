Thats because there some great details at play here, like the legend-less two-tone keycaps and the neat-o locking box it sits in.\nThis keyboard is inspired by the Hacoa Ki-board, which uses a singles plank of wood to craft the keycaps. [Kelvin] wanted to try this technique for themselves. Evidently this wont be the last wooden keyboard, so stay tuned for more over on Hackaday.io.\nThis isnt the first dead-tree keyboard weve seen around here, either. A while back we saw one with Scrabble tile keycaps, and earlier this year, a nice wooden macro pad.\n\nOne Persons Keyboard Journey\nBig thanks to [quinor] for this tip. I present to you [tslil clingman]s keyboard journey so far. I love a good progression story, as we all have them on our way to whatever we consider end game on any given day.\nIt all started with an Atreus kit, which [tslil] modified with sweet-looking 3D-printed keycaps and a laser-cut case. This worked well for many years until the layout started bothering [tslil]s wrists.\nThen it was on to the dactyl manuform mini shown here, which [tslil] printed in wood PLA and sanded to arboreal perfection. But this had too many keys, so it was back to the drawing board, or the finger-painting board as it were. This time around, [tslil] dipped their fingers in paint in order to create the perfect layout.\nYoud think that would be the end game, but no. Being hand-wired, it was simply too fragile. So in the latest version, [tslil] designed their own PCBs. The particularly interesting thing here is the keymap, which was chosen algorithmically based on certain metrics. Oh, and an honorable mention goes to that art deco clock at the bottom.\nThe Centerfold: Just Another Day At the Office\n\nFinally, we have a gallery centerfold, and the first picture is a teensy bit NSFW, so hold on to your hats or whatever.\nNow obviously, this is not your normal office, this is a some kind of cool traveling setup. One that others cant avoid seeing all the time. While I dont agree with the ergonomics of this setup like, at all, I really dig that Yellow Submarine-art-meets-old-school-cartoon aesthetic of the (sold out) desk pad, and I love that [coalxxx] doesnt give a care that it doesnt quite fit.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: The Blickensderfer No. 5\nCheck out those modern legends. Image via The Antikey Chop\nA couple of installments ago, I told you about the stunning Crandall New Model, which bore a removable type element sleeve that allowed the use of different typefaces.\nAt the time, I speculated that it was the inspiration for the IBM Selectrics awesome little golf ball element. But between the two in time lies the Blickensderfer series with their cylindrical type elements.\nBlickensderfer typewriter design radically reduced the complexity of the typewriter, bearing 250 parts compared to the 2,500 parts of the average machine.\nAs with all Blickensderfer typewriters, the No. 5 bore the scientifically-chosen DHIATENSOR layout. A study of the English language showed that 70% of written text and 85% of words contained the letters DHIATENSOR, and thus this became the home row, albeit on the bottom. Those who use DHIATENSOR today put it on the middle row.\nICYMI: DIY Stream Deck Takes No Shortcuts\nNo, the OpenDeck isnt a commercial product, although you can buy one from Tindie when theyre back in stock.\n[Josh R] designed this to be a cheaper alternative to the various stream decks out there, and I think it looks fantastic by comparison. And based on the demo video, it works just as well as they do.\nUnder the hood is an ESP8266 Wemos D1 Mini V4, which is part of the spec if youre interested in building your own. So is the screen, which must be a 128 x 160 TFT so it can line up with the frame that divides it into four. If you ask me, the carbon fiber should be mandatory as well, because that is just slick.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

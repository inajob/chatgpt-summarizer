This board was developed to replace the 68000 CPU in a MiniMig  a recreation of the original Amiga chipset in an FPGA allowing a real genuine 68000 CPU to operate.\nThe PiStorm68K itself can host a real genuine 68000 CPU but it can also host various Raspberry Pi models which can do emulation of a 68000. So if you combine a PiStorm68K with a MiniMig you can, at your option, boot into an emulated environment with massively increased performance, or you can boot into an original environment, with its reliable and charming sluggishness.\nIn the introduction video below, [AmiCube] uses the SYSINFO utility software to compare the CPU speed when using emulation (1531 MIPS) versus the original (4.47 MIPS), where MIPS means Millions of Instructions Per Second. As you can see the 68000 emulated by the Raspberry Pi is way faster than the original. The Raspberry Pi also emulates a floating-point unit (FPU) which the original doesnt include and a memory management unit (MMU) which isnt used.\nIf youre interested in old Amiga tech you might also like to read about Chip Swap Fixes A Dead Amiga 600 or The Many-Sprites Interpretation Of Amiga Mechanics.\n\n", "title": "- PiStorm68K\u7279\u5225\u7248\u767a\u8868\uff1aMiniMig\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30e9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "AmiCube\u304cMiniMig\u7528\u306ePiStorm68K\u62e1\u5f35\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u767a\u8868\u300268000 CPU\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- PiStorm68K\u7279\u5225\u7248\u767a\u8868\uff1aMiniMig\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30e9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- Raspberry Pi\u3068\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u306768000 CPU\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "- \u672c\u7269\u306e68000 CPU\u3068\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- SYSINFO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPiStorm68K\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6e2c\u5b9a\u7d50\u679c", "- Amiga\u6280\u8853\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u60c5\u5831"]}

Practical computers dont quite follow the design of a Turing Machine, but if we are prepared to sacrifice its need for an infinitely long paper tape its quite possible to build one. This is what [The Bananaman] has done using LEGO as a medium, and if youd like one for yourself you can even vote for it on the LEGO ideas website.\nTheres a video for the project which weve placed below, and it goes into quite some detail on the various mechanisms required. Indeed for someone used to physical machinery its a better explanation through seeing the various parts than many paper explanations. Not for the first time were bowled over by what is possible through the use of the LEGO precision mouldings, this is a machine which would have been difficult and expensive to build in the 1930s by individually machining all its parts.\nWith just shy of six thousand supporters and a hefty 763 days left at time of writing, theres plenty of time for it to garner support. But if you want one dont delay, boost the project by voting for it early.\n\n\nThanks [Furby73] for the tip!", "title": "\u30ec\u30b4\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff1a\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "1936\u5e74\u306b\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u6570\u5b66\u8005\u3067\u3042\u308a\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30d1\u30a4\u30aa\u30cb\u30a2\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30a2\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u3001\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u8a18\u8ff0\u3057\u305f\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u3044\u5834\u5408\u306fLEGO\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u6295\u7968\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30b4\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff1a\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u767a\u660e", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u30ec\u30b4\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u6295\u7968\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

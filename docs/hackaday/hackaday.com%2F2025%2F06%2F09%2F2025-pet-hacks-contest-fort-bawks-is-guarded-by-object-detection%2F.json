Foxes, raccoons, hawks  if it can eat meat, it probably wants a bite of your flock. [donutsorelse] wanted to protect his flock and to be able to know when predators were about without staying up all night next to the hen-house. What to do but outsource the role of Chicken Guardian to a Raspberry pi?\nObject detection is done using a YOLOv8 model trained on images of the various predators local to [donutorelse]. The model is running on a Raspberry Pi and getting images from a standard webcam. Since the webcam has no low-light capability, the system also has a motion-activated light thats arguably goes a long way towards spooking predators away itself. To help with the spooking, a speaker module plays specific sound files for each detected predator  presumably different sounds might work better at scaring off different predators.\n\nIf that doesnt work, the system phones home to activate a siren inside [donutorelse]s house, using a Blues Wireless Notecarrier F as a cellular USB modem. The siren is just a dumb unit; activation is handled via a TP-Link smart plug thats hooked into [donutorelse]s custom smart home setup. Presumably the siren cues [donutorelse] to take action against the predator assault on the chickens.\nWeirdly enough, this isnt the first time weve seen an AI-enabled chicken coop, but it is the first one to make into our ongoing challenge, which incidentally wraps up today.\n \n\n"}

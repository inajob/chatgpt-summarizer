Foxes, raccoons, hawks  if it can eat meat, it probably wants a bite of your flock. [donutsorelse] wanted to protect his flock and to be able to know when predators were about without staying up all night next to the hen-house. What to do but outsource the role of Chicken Guardian to a Raspberry pi?\nObject detection is done using a YOLOv8 model trained on images of the various predators local to [donutorelse]. The model is running on a Raspberry Pi and getting images from a standard webcam. Since the webcam has no low-light capability, the system also has a motion-activated light thats arguably goes a long way towards spooking predators away itself. To help with the spooking, a speaker module plays specific sound files for each detected predator  presumably different sounds might work better at scaring off different predators.\n\nIf that doesnt work, the system phones home to activate a siren inside [donutorelse]s house, using a Blues Wireless Notecarrier F as a cellular USB modem. The siren is just a dumb unit; activation is handled via a TP-Link smart plug thats hooked into [donutorelse]s custom smart home setup. Presumably the siren cues [donutorelse] to take action against the predator assault on the chickens.\nWeirdly enough, this isnt the first time weve seen an AI-enabled chicken coop, but it is the first one to make into our ongoing challenge, which incidentally wraps up today.\n \n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30cb\u30ef\u30c8\u30ea\u306e\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3", "body": "\u9d8f\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3067AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6355\u98df\u8005\u691c\u77e5\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002\u97f3\u3084\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u3067\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30cb\u30ef\u30c8\u30ea\u306e\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3", "- YOLOv8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6355\u98df\u8005\u691c\u51fa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3067\u30cb\u30ef\u30c8\u30ea\u3092\u5b88\u308b", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3067\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u3092\u9cf4\u3089\u3059\u9632\u885b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- AI\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9d8f\u5c0f\u5c4b\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

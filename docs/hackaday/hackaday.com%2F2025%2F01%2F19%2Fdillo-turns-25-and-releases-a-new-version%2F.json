At the top end of the web browser world there are now depressingly few maintained browser engines  we think to the detriment of web standards evolution.\nMoving away from the big players though, there are several small browser projects which eschew bells and whistles for speed and compactness, and were pleased to see that one of the perennial players has released a new version as it passes its quarter century.\nDillo describes itself as  a fast and small graphical web browser, and it provides a basic window on the web with a tiny download and the ability to run on very low-end hardware. Without JavaScript and other luxuries it sometimes doesnt render a site as youd see it in Chrome or Firefox, but were guessing many users would relish some escape from the webs cycle-sucking garbage. The new version 3.2.0 brings bug fixes, as well as math formula rendering, and navigation improvements.\nThe special thing about Dillo is that this is a project which came back from the dead. We reported last year how a developer resurrected it after a previous release back in 2015, and it seems that for now at least it has a healthy future. So put it on your retro PC, your original Raspberry Pi, or your Atari if you have one, and try it on your modern desktop if you need reminding just how fast web browsing can be.\nThis isnt the only interesting browser project on the block, were also keeping an eye on Ladybird, which is aiming for those big players rather than simplicity like Dillo.\nThanks [Feinfinger] for the tip.", "title": "- \u672c\u683c\u7684\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u300cDillo\u300d\u304c\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "Dillo\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8efd\u91cf\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u304c\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3002\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u3082\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u672c\u683c\u7684\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u300cDillo\u300d\u304c\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9", "- Dillo 3.2.0\uff1a\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30afPC\u3067\u3082\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u89e3\u653e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u300cDillo\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u5e02\u5834\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u306e\u300cDillo\u300d\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u5287", "- \u5927\u624b\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306b\u6311\u3080\u300cLadybird\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5c55\u671b"]}

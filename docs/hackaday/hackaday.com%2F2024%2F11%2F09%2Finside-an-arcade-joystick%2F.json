He picked up a cheap replacement joystick, which, as you might expect, has a bunch of microswitches. However, as you can see in the video below, there are some surprising features that make sense when you think about it.\nFor one, there are plates you can put on the bottom to limit the joysticks travel depending on the game. That is, some games only want the stick to move up and down or left and right. The knobs are quite nice, and [Clive] mentions the size and thread of the knob with the idea you could use them in different applications. You can also buy replacement knobs if you dont want to get the whole assembly.\nThe mechanics are rugged but straightforward. The circuit board is surprisingly stylish but also simple. Still interesting to see whats inside one of these, even though the schematic is extremely simple.\nIf you need an excuse to use one of these, how about an arcade table? If you arent a woodworker, grab a 3D printer instead.\n\n"}

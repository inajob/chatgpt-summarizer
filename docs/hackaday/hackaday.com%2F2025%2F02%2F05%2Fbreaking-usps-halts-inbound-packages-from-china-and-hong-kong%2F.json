While details are still coming together, it seems likely that this suspension is part of the Trump administration\u2019s Chinese tariff package, which went into effect at midnight.\nSpecifically, the administration looks to close the de minimis exemption  a loophole which allowed packages valued under $800 USD to pass through customs without having to pay any duties or fees. Retailers like Temu, Shein, and of course AliExpress have used this to their advantage, resulting in literally millions of such packages hitting US shores each day. Those packages will now not only be subject to the overall 10% tax imposed by the new tariff package, but will now have to be formally processed through customs, potentially tacking on even more taxes and fees.\nThe end result is that not only will your next order of parts from AliExpress be more expensive, but its likely to take even longer to arrive at your door. Of course, this should come as no surprise. At the end of the day, this is precisely what the administration aims to accomplish with the new tariffs  if purchasing goods from overseas is suddenly a less attractive option than it was previously, it will be a boon to domestic suppliers. We imagine there are a lot of smiles over at DigiKey and Mouser this morning. That said, some components will be imported from China regardless of who you order them from, so those prices are still going to increase.\nOther carriers such as FedEx and UPS will also have to follow these new rules, but at the time of this writing, neither service had released a statement about how they intend to comply.", "title": "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u3068\u9999\u6e2f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8377\u7269\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u4e00\u6642\u505c\u6b62\u3001\u7c73\u56fd\u90f5\u4fbf\u516c\u793e\u304c\u767a\u8868", "body": "\u7c73\u56fd\u90f5\u4fbf\u5c40\u304c\u4e2d\u56fd\u30fb\u9999\u6e2f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8377\u7269\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u95a2\u7a0e\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u51e6\u7406\u624b\u7d9a\u304d\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3001\u66f4\u306b\u8cbb\u7528\u304c\u304b\u3055\u3080\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e2d\u56fd\u3068\u9999\u6e2f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8377\u7269\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u4e00\u6642\u505c\u6b62\u3001\u7c73\u56fd\u90f5\u4fbf\u516c\u793e\u304c\u767a\u8868", "- \u65b0\u95a2\u7a0e\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u8f38\u5165\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u624b\u7d9a\u304d\u304c\u8907\u96d1\u5316", "- \u7c73\u56fd\u3078\u306e\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u4e0a\u6607\u304c\u4e88\u60f3\u3055\u308c\u308b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5165\u624b\u304c\u3055\u3089\u306b\u56f0\u96e3\u306b\u3001\u56fd\u5185\u4f9b\u7d66\u696d\u8005\u306e\u9700\u8981\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u308b", "- FedEx\u3068UPS\u3082\u65b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u5f93\u3046\u5fc5\u8981\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u672a\u5b9a"]}

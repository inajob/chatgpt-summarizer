For 20-some years, [Eric] and the late [Richard Ottosen] have been incrementally developing various DIY calculators  this paper from the 2005 HHC conference is an excellent overview of the early project. [John] got one of those early DIY calculators and set about modifying it to use Nixie tubes. However, he got distracted by other things and set it aside  until reviving it earlier this year and enlisting [Eric]s aid.\nThis presentation goes over the hardware aspects of the design. Unlike the earlier PIC-based DIY calculators, they decided to use a WCH RISC-V processor this time around. The calculators architecture is intentionally modular, with the display and keyboard housed in completely separate enclosures communicating by a serial interface. If the bulkiness alone doesnt exclude it from being pocket-sized, the 170 VDC power supply and 1/2 W per digit power consumption certainly does. This modularity does lend itself to DIYers replacing the display, or the keyboard, with something different. [Eric] wants to build a mechanical flip-digit display for his unit. As for the software, [Eric] reviews the firmware approach and some future upgrades, such as making it programmable and emulating other flavors of HP calculators.\nIf youre embarking on a similar project yourself, check out this talk and take notes  there are a lot of interesting tidbits on using Nixie tubes in the 21st century. If [Eric]s name sounds familiar, you may know him from the Nonpareil calculator software used on many emulators and DIY calculator projects, one of which we covered some years ago. [John] is also a long-time tinkerer, and we wrote about his gorgeous D16/M HCMOS computer system back in 2012. Thanks to [Stephen Walters] for sending in the tip.\n\n", "title": "DIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3092Nixie\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3067\u6539\u826f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u4f1a\u8b70\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14", "body": "DIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3092\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u9762\u304b\u3089\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u5f0f\u3067\u72ec\u7acb\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Nixie\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u6539\u9020\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002RISC-V\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3084\u4ed6\u306eHP\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3082\u691c\u8a0e\u4e2d\u3002Nixie\u7ba1\u306e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3092Nixie\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3067\u6539\u826f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u4f1a\u8b70\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14", "WCH RISC-V\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u306eDIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8981\u7d20\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "Nixie\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e21\u4e16\u7d00\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5229\u7528\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u60c5\u5831", "DIY\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bNixie\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

That can be a little bit more difficult on something like a motorcycle with a sequential shifter. [decogabry] built a neat gearshift indicator to solve this issue.\nAn ESP32 devboard is used as the brain of the build. Its paired with an ELM327 dongle over Bluetooth, which is able to hook into the bikes ODB diagnostic port to pick up data like engine RPM, wheel speed, and coolant temperature. The first two factors are combined in order to calculate the current gear, since the ratio between engine RPM and wheel speed is determined directly by the gear selection. The ESP32 then commands a Philips ZM1020 Nixie tube to display the gear, driving it via a small nest of MPSA42 transistors. A separate self-contained power supply module is used to take the bikes 12 volt supply up to the 170 volts needed to run the tube. There is also a small four-digit display used to show status information, RPM, and engine temperature.\nNotably,\u00a0 [decogabry] made this build rather flexible, to suit any bike it might be installed upon. The gear ratios are not hard coded in software. Instead, there is a simple learning routine that runs the first time the system is powered up, which compares RPM and wheel speed during a steady-state ride and saves the ratios to flash.\nWeve featured projects before that used different techniques to achieve similar ends. Its also interesting to speculate as to whether theres a motorcycle vintage enough to suit a Nixie display while still having an ODB interface on board as standard. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own neat automotive builds, dont hesitate to drop us a line."}

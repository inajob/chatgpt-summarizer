They specifically wanted one that was affordable, capable, and included a graphic equalizer so they could simply hook it up to a regular amplifier and dial in the perfect sound. When they couldnt find such a device, they decided to build their own.\nThe build is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico, chosen for its feature set that makes it easy to configure as a USB audio device. Its paired with a Waveshare Pico Audio module, which is based on the PCM5101A stereo DAC and slots neatly on top of the microcontroller board. An SPI-controlled LCD screen was also fitted in order to display the graphic equalizer interface that [shiura] whipped up. The project write-up explains the code required to implement the equalizer in detail. A four-channel equalizer was possible on the original Pi Pico (RP2040), while upgrading to a more powerful Pi Pico 2 (RP2350) allowed implementing eight channels in total.\nIf youre looking to build a digital audio system with the ability to do some equalization to suit your listening room, this might be a project of interest to you. Weve featured other projects in this realm before, too.\n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9ad8\u97f3\u8ceaDAC\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3001Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u72ec\u81ea\u306eDAC\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a4\u30b3\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9ad8\u97f3\u8ceaDAC\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u51fa\u529b\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a4\u30b3\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u7406\u60f3\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3059\u308b", "- \u30d4\u30b3\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u56db\u30c1\u30e3\u30cd\u30eb\u30fb\u516b\u30c1\u30e3\u30cd\u30eb\u30a4\u30b3\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5"]}

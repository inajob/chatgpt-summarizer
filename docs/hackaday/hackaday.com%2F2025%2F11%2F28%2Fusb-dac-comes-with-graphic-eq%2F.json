They specifically wanted one that was affordable, capable, and included a graphic equalizer so they could simply hook it up to a regular amplifier and dial in the perfect sound. When they couldnt find such a device, they decided to build their own.\nThe build is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico, chosen for its feature set that makes it easy to configure as a USB audio device. Its paired with a Waveshare Pico Audio module, which is based on the PCM5101A stereo DAC and slots neatly on top of the microcontroller board. An SPI-controlled LCD screen was also fitted in order to display the graphic equalizer interface that [shiura] whipped up. The project write-up explains the code required to implement the equalizer in detail. A four-channel equalizer was possible on the original Pi Pico (RP2040), while upgrading to a more powerful Pi Pico 2 (RP2350) allowed implementing eight channels in total.\nIf youre looking to build a digital audio system with the ability to do some equalization to suit your listening room, this might be a project of interest to you. Weve featured other projects in this realm before, too.\n\n"}

Thanks to [indyjonas]s incredible hack, the world now has a working port of DOOM for the Atari STe, and yes \u2014 it runs. Its called STDOOM, and even though it needs a bit of acceleration or emulation to perform, its still an astonishing feat of retro-software necromancy.\n[indyjonas] did more than just recompile and run: he stripped out chunks of PC-centric code, bent GCC to his will (cheers to Thorsten Ottos port), and shoehorned Doom into a machine never meant to handle it. That brings us a version that runs on a stock machine with 4MB RAM, in native ST graphics modes, including a dithered 16-colour mode that looks way cooler than it should. The emotional punch? This is a love letter to the 13-year-old Jonas who watched Doom from the sidelines while his ST chugged along faithfully. A lot of us were that kid.\nSound is still missing, and original 8MHz hardware wont give you fluid gameplay just yet \u2014 but hey, its a start. Want to dive in deeper?

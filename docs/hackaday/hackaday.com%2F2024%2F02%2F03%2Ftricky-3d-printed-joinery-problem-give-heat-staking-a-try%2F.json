In such cases, most of us instinctively include threaded inserts or nut slots in the design, or even reach for a tube of CA glue. But perhaps you should be thinking more along the lines of heat-staking your printed parts together.\nAlthough you might not be familiar with the term, if youve looked inside anything made out of plastic, chances are good youve seen a heat-staked joint. As [Richard Sewell] explains, a heat-staked joint is nothing more than the classic mortise-and-tenon made from plastic where the tenon stands proud of the joint face so it can be softened with heat. The tenon spreads out so the joint cant be pulled apart. A variant on the theme includes a mortise with a generous chamfer so the melted tenon can spread out, providing not only extra resistance to pull-out be also a more flush surface.\nTo melt the joint, [Richard] simply uses a soldering iron and a little pressure. To spread out both the heat and the force a bit, he uses the barrel of the iron rather than a tip, although we could see a broad chisel tip being used for smaller joints. Either way, a layer of Kapton tape helps keep the iron from getting gunked up with melted plastic. [Richard] lists a host of advantages for this kind of plastic joinery, including eliminating the need for additional hardware. But we think the best feature of this joint is that by avoiding monolithic prints, each aspect of a part can have its layer lines optimized.\nWhile it probably isnt applicable everywhere, heat-staking looks like a technique to keep in mind. Wed love to see [Stefan] over at CNC Kitchen do some of his testing magic on these joints, like he did for threaded inserts.", "title": "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306b\u3064\u306a\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u6a39\u8102\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u63a5\u5408\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u52a0\u71b1\u6eb6\u7740\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5c64\u304c\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3055\u308c\u308b\u5229\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306b\u3064\u306a\u3052\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30e2\u30ce\u30ea\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3068\u7d50\u5408\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d50\u5408\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u7d50\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

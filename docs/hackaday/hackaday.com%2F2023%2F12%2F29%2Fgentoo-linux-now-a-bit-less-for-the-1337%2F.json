Ubuntu users have little shame, while at the other end if you followed Linux From Scratch or better still hand-compiled the code and carved it onto the raw silicon with a tiny chisel, youre at the top of the tree*. Jokes aside though, its fair to say that if you were running the Gentoo distribution you were something of a hardcore user, because its source-only nature meant that everything had to be compiled to your liking. Were using the past tense here though, because in a surprise announcement, the distro has revealed that it will henceforth also be available as a set of precompiled binary packages.\nThere may be readers with long and flowing neckbeards who will decry this moment as the Beginning of the End, but while it does signal a major departure for the distro if it means that more people are spurred to take their Linux usage further and experiment with Gentoo, this can never be a bad thing. Gentoo has been on the list for a future Jennys Daily Drivers OS review piece, and while were probably going to stick with source-only when we do it, its undeniable that there will remain a temptation to simply download the binaries.\nMeanwhile this has been written on a machine running Manjaro, or Arch-for-cowards as we like to call it, something that maybe confers middle-ranking bragging rights. Read a personal tale of taking off those Linux training wheels.\n* Used a magnifying glass? Youre just not cutting it!", "title": "Gentoo\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u304c\u3001\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306e\u767a\u8868\u3067\u30d7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01", "body": "Gentoo distribution, known for its source-only nature, will now offer precompiled binaries.

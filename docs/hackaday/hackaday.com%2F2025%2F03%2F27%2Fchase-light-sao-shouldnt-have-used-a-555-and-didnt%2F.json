But the sentiment stands that a solution more complicated than it needs to be is probably one that needs rethinking, as this completely mechanical chaser light badge Simple Add-On (SAO)\u00a0aptly demonstrates.\nRather than choosing any number of circuits to turn a strip of discrete lights on and off, [Johannes] took inspiration for his chaser lights from factory automation mechanisms that move parts between levels on steps that move out of phase with each other, similar to the marble-raising mechanism used in [Wintergatan]s Marble Machine X.\nTwo thin plates with notches around the edge are sandwiched together inside the 3D printed case of the SAO, between the face and the light source. A small motor and a series of gears rotate the two masks 180\u00b0 out of phase with each other, which creates the illusion that the light is moving.\nIts pretty convincing; when we first saw the video below, we were sure it was a row of tiny LEDs around the edge of the badge.\nHats off to [Johannes] for coming up with such a clever mechanism and getting it working just in time for Hackaday Europe. If you need to catch up on the talks, weve got a playlist ready for you.\n\n", "title": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5149\u306e\u8ffd\u5f93\u52b9\u679c", "body": "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u5149\u304c\u52d5\u304f\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5149\u306e\u8ffd\u5f93\u52b9\u679c", "555\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u5185\u306e\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u5149\u523a\u6fc0\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c1aser\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "Hackaday Europe\u3067\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

But the sentiment stands that a solution more complicated than it needs to be is probably one that needs rethinking, as this completely mechanical chaser light badge Simple Add-On (SAO)\u00a0aptly demonstrates.\nRather than choosing any number of circuits to turn a strip of discrete lights on and off, [Johannes] took inspiration for his chaser lights from factory automation mechanisms that move parts between levels on steps that move out of phase with each other, similar to the marble-raising mechanism used in [Wintergatan]s Marble Machine X.\nTwo thin plates with notches around the edge are sandwiched together inside the 3D printed case of the SAO, between the face and the light source. A small motor and a series of gears rotate the two masks 180\u00b0 out of phase with each other, which creates the illusion that the light is moving.\nIts pretty convincing; when we first saw the video below, we were sure it was a row of tiny LEDs around the edge of the badge.\nHats off to [Johannes] for coming up with such a clever mechanism and getting it working just in time for Hackaday Europe. If you need to catch up on the talks, weve got a playlist ready for you.\n\n"}

Even into the early 2000s, CRTs were everywhere and continuously getting upgrades, with the last consumer displays even having a semi-flat option. Their size and weight was still a major problem, though, but for a long time they were cutting edge. Wanting to go back to this time with their original Game Boy, [James Channel] went about replacing their Game Boy screen with a CRT.\nThe CRT itself is salvaged from an old video conferencing system and while its never been used before, it wasnt recently made. To get the proper video inputs for this old display, the Game Boy needed to be converted to LCD first, as some of these modules have video output that can be fed to other displays. Providing the display with power was another challenge, requiring a separate boost converter to get 12V from the Game Boys 6V supply. After getting everything wired up a few adjustments needed to be made, and with that the CRT is up and running.\nUnfortunately, there was a major speed bump in this process when [James Channel]s method of automatically switching the display to the CRT let the magic smoke out of the Game Boys processor. But he was able to grab a replacement CPU from a Super Game Boy, hack together a case, and fix the problem with the automatic video switcher. Everything now is in working order for a near-perfect retro display upgrade. If youd like to do this without harming any original hardware, weve seen a similar build based on the ESP32 instead.\n\n\nThanks to [Lurch] for the tip!", "title": "CRT\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u753b\u9762\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "2000\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u307e\u3067\u3001CRT\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u6642\u4ee3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002CRT\u306f\u5927\u578b\u3067\u91cd\u304f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306fLCD\u306e\u5909\u63db\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002CRT\u3092Game Boy\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u969b\u3001CPU\u304c\u640d\u50b7\u3057\u305f\u304c\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u304b\u3089\u4ea4\u63db\u3002", "titles": ["CRT\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u753b\u9762\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u3044\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u4f1a\u8b70\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u306eCRT\u518d\u5229\u7528", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u306eCRT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3078\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u5909\u63db", "CRT\u753b\u9762\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "ESP32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ce\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u4ea4\u63db"]}

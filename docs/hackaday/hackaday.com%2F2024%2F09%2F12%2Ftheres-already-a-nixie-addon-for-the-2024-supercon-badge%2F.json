Perhaps for those reasons more than any other, [Kevin Santo Cappuccio] has developed a very particular Simple Add-On for the 2024 Hackaday Supercon badge.\nRad, no?\nThe build began with a Burroughs 122P224 Nixie tube, and a HV8200 power supply. The latter component is key\u2014its capable of turning voltages as low as 3 V into the 180V needed to power a Nixie. Then, an 18-position selector switch was pulled out of a resistance substitution box, and [Kevin] whipped up a basic DIY slip ring using some raw copper clad board.\nSmoosh it all together, and what do you get? Its a Nixie tube you can spin to change the number it displays. Useful? Hardly, unless you want to display varying glowing numbers to people at unreadable angles. Neat? Very. Just dont touch any of the pins carrying 180 V, thatll sting. Still, [Kevin] told us its pretty tucked away. Im totally comfortable touching it, but also would get sued into oblivion selling these on Amazon, he says.\nAs [Kevin] notes in his post, the 2024 badge is all about the add-ons\u2014 and theres actually a contest! We suspect [Kevin] will have a strong chance of taking out the Least Manufacturable title.\nIf you need more information about the Simple Add-On (SAO) interface, [Brian Benchoff] posted the V1.69bis standard on these very pages back in 2019. Apparently the S used to stand for something else. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u3053\u305e\u3063\u3066\u611b\u3059\u308bNixie tube\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "body": "2024 Hackaday Supercon\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306eNixie tube\u3092\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u6570\u5b57\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308bSimple Add-On\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002Nixie tube\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059HV8200\u96fb\u6e90\u306a\u3069\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u64cd\u4f5c\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3060\u3068\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u3053\u305e\u3063\u3066\u611b\u3059\u308bNixie tube\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "2024 Hackaday Supercon badge\u5411\u3051\u306eNixie tube\u8ffd\u52a0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u958b\u767a", "DIY Nixie tube\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u6ce8\u610f - \u8aad\u307f\u3065\u3089\u3044\u304c\u30ab\u30c3\u30b3\u3044\u3044Nixie tube", "2024 Hackaday Supercon badge\u5411\u3051\u306eLeast Manufacturable\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee"]}

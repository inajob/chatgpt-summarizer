[vagabondvivant] found this to be the case and rolled their own distraction-free writing tool, the Foliodeck.\nWith the increasing availability of parts for cyberdecks, its not too surprising to see were seeing the emergence of the writerdeck. Typically designed to be a no frills word processing device, they are designed to help their creators focus on writing and not be subject to the myriad notifications present trying to work with a more general computing device or smartphone.\nIn this case, [vagabondvivant] took a classy looking planner folio and removed its paper management components to leave a fabric and leather shell. The heart of the assembly is a HiSense A5 eink smartphone magnetically attached to a piece of MDF cut to mate the phone to the planner shell. A 10Ah powerbank slots into the MDF below the keyboard which is also magnetically attached, and the whole thing zips up nicely. Future improvements are planned like a hinge, so it doesnt have to be propped against something and a custom-built mechanical keyboard.\nThis isnt the first writerdeck weve seen, and weve seen some other writer-focused decks and typewriter replacements.\n\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Foliodeck_f04ca8.mp4\n\n"}

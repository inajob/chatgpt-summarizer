[vagabondvivant] found this to be the case and rolled their own distraction-free writing tool, the Foliodeck.\nWith the increasing availability of parts for cyberdecks, its not too surprising to see were seeing the emergence of the writerdeck. Typically designed to be a no frills word processing device, they are designed to help their creators focus on writing and not be subject to the myriad notifications present trying to work with a more general computing device or smartphone.\nIn this case, [vagabondvivant] took a classy looking planner folio and removed its paper management components to leave a fabric and leather shell. The heart of the assembly is a HiSense A5 eink smartphone magnetically attached to a piece of MDF cut to mate the phone to the planner shell. A 10Ah powerbank slots into the MDF below the keyboard which is also magnetically attached, and the whole thing zips up nicely. Future improvements are planned like a hinge, so it doesnt have to be propped against something and a custom-built mechanical keyboard.\nThis isnt the first writerdeck weve seen, and weve seen some other writer-focused decks and typewriter replacements.\n\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Foliodeck_f04ca8.mp4\n\n", "title": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3001Foliodeck\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u96d1\u97f3\u304b\u3089\u9003\u308c\u3066\u6587\u7ae0\u3092\u66f8\u304d\u305f\u3044\u6642\u3001[vagabondvivant]\u306fFoliodeck\u3068\u3044\u3046\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u7121\u6a5f\u7269\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002MDF\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u53ce\u7d0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u306f\u30d2\u30f3\u30b8\u3084\u5c02\u7528\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u8003\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3001Foliodeck\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u96c6\u4e2d\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "HiSense A5 eink\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30fc\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u30ea\u30aa\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u5b8c\u6210", "\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u5c02\u7528\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3000- \u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u30fbDIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01"]}

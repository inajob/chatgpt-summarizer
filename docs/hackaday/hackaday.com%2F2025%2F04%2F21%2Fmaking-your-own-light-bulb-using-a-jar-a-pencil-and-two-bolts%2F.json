Install the two bolts into the lid. Take a pencil lead and secure it between the two bolts. Chop off the tip of a candle and glue it inside the lid. Light the candle and while its burning cover it with the jar and screw on the lid. Apply power and your light bulb will glow.\n\nThe incandescent light bulb was invented by Thomas Edison and patented in patent US223898 in 1879. Its important to remove the oxygen from the bulb so that the filament doesnt burn up when it gets hot. Thats what the candle is for, to burn out all the oxygen in the jar before its sealed.\nOf course if you want something that is energy efficient youre going to want an LED light bulb.\n"}

Yet what is special about this display other than its odd form factor when you consider it as a generic touch display? As [Wenting Zhang] describes in a recent reverse-engineering video, this 2,170 x 60 pixel display is somewhat limited in that it doesnt support the MIPI DSI video mode, only command mode, along with a special instruction (0x3C) for automatic address offsets. The results of this project can be found on the GitLab account.\nIn a way these limitations make sense when you consider Apples use case for these special MIPI-DSI displays. As a touch screen with dynamic controls being displayed on it, features such as video playback never were a goal, and thus Apple likely decided to save a few bucks, possibly also due to MIPI licensing costs. What this means is that if you had dreamed of snapping up an extremely long and narrow OLED display for a video project youre in for somewhat of a bad time. Although animated content is possible  as [Wenting] demonstrates  this comes with all the limitations of command mode, meaning slower updates, higher power usage and a lot more overhead.\nThanks to [John Little] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "Apple \u306e Touch Bar \u306f MIPI DSI video mode \u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "body": "Apple\u306eTouch Bar\u306f\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u3042\u308bApple\u306e\u5c11\u6570\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306fMIPI DSI\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u305b\u305a\u3001\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u547d\u4ee4\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u7279\u5225\u306a\u547d\u4ee4\uff080x3C\uff09\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u5236\u9650\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u8868\u793a\u306e\u66f4\u65b0\u304c\u9045\u304f\u3001\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Apple \u306e Touch Bar \u306f MIPI DSI video mode \u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3088\u308b Apple Touch Bar \u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u89e3\u8aac", "Apple \u306e Touch Bar \u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u9577\u304f\u3066\u72ed\u3044 OLED \u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306f Apple \u306e Touch Bar \u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b", "Command \u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5236\u9650\u306b\u3088\u308b Apple Touch Bar \u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

Much like how inconsistencies in the density of the materials of the planet can impact the local gravitational force ever so slightly, so to can slight changes impact the strength of the magnetic field from place to place. And it doesnt take too much to measure this impact on your own, as [efeyenice983] demonstrates here.\nTo measure this local field strength, the first item needed is a working compass. With the compass aligned to north, a magnet is placed with its poles aligned at a right angle to the compass. The deflection angle of the needle is noted for varying distances of the magnet, and with some quick math the local field strength of the Earths magnetic field can be calculated based on the strength of the magnet and the amount of change of the compass needle when under its influence.\nUsing this method, [efeyenice983] found that the Earths magnetic field strength at their location was about 0.49 Gauss, which is well within 0.25 to 0.65 Gauss that is typically found on the planets surface. Not only does the magnetic field strength vary with location, its been generally decreasing in strength on average over the past century or so as well, and the poles themselves arent stationary either. Check out this article which shows just how much the poles have shifted over the last few decades."}

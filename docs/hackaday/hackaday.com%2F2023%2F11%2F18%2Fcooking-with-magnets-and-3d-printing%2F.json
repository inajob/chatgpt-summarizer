A rotating magnetic field  electrically or mechanically  induces eddy currents in aluminum and that generates heat. When [3D Sage] learned this, he decided to try to 3D print some mechanical rigs to spin magnets so he could try cooking with them.\nWe doubt at all that this is practical, but we have to admit it is fun and there are some pretty impressive 3D prints in the video, too. The cook surface, by the way, is tiny, so you wont be prepping a holiday meal on it. But theres something super charming about the tiny breakfast on a plate produced by a printed magnetic stove. We would be interested to know how much power this setup consumed and how much heat was produced compared to, say, just using a big resistor to heat things up.\nWeve heard that induction heating is efficient, but this setup is a bit unconventional. If cooking things isnt your bag, you can use induction for soldering, too.\n\n"}

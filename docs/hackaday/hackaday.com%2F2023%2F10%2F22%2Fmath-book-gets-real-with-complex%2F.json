His latest acquisition is the famous Real and Complex Analysis, which is a very stout math book.\u00a0 How stout? Well, there are several chapters on holomorphic functions, including how to do a Fourier transform on such a function. Theres also an appendix about Hausdorffs maximality theorem. What are those? Beats us; read the book. You can also watch the short video review of the text below.\nThe author asserts right up front that the exponential function is undoubtedly the most important function in mathematics. Undoubtedly. [The Math Sorcerers] videos remind us of browsing a bookstore or a library. You dont get a book summary as much as a preview of whats in it, so you can decide if you want to read it.\n\nWe have to admit that his book list isnt light reading. The second video below covers Elementary Quantum Mechanics. Calling a quantum mechanics textbook elementary is an excellent oxymoron right up there with random order or seriously funny.\nSuppose your calculus and differential equations arent up to snuff. In that case, the channel does offer videos, often featuring books, ranging from Math for Super Beginners and Learn Calculus Fast, which might be the first step in a long path to where you can enjoy either of the two books he mentions.\nWe like things that make learning math faster and easier. However, maybe you can go too fast.\n\n"}

[Eric Migicovsky] and [SQFMI] are working on a new physical keyboard device with the Beepberry.\nFeaturing a high contrast Sharp Memory LCD and the tried-and-true reliability of a BlackBerry keyboard, the device is designed for messaging all your contacts over WiFi without the distractions of a smartphone. As this is a collaboration with the Matrix-based chat service Beeper, the device is designed around the CLI version of their client.\nIf you want to eschew the distraction-free nature of the device, since its Pi-powered it can run any ARM Linux programs you might want as well being a playground for hardware mods. Add a DSP and headphone jack and this could be a neat little pianobar player. [Migicovsky] stresses this is currently a dev board and by no means should be assumed to be an off-the-shelf piece of kit.\nIf this looks like a familiar reuse of a BlackBerry keyboard, you might be remembering [arturo182]s Keyboard Featherwing or this LoRa Messenger.\n\n"}

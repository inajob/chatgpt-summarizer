In 1966, the main spacecraft ejected a 99-kg lander module that used a landing bag to survive impact. The problem is, given the technology limitations of 1966, no one is exactly sure where it is now. But it looks like thats about to change.\nA model of the Luna 9 lander with petals deployed.\nWe know that the lander bounced a few times and came to rest somewhere in Oceanus Procellarum, in the area of the Reiner and Marius craters. The craft deployed four stabilizing petals and sent back dramatic panoramas of the lunar surface. The Soviets were not keen to share, but Western radio astronomers noticed the pictures were in the standard Radiofax format, so the world got a glimpse of the moon, and journalists speculated that the use of a standard might have been a deliberate choice of the designers to end run against the governments unwillingness to share data.\nSeveral scientists have been looking for the remains of the historic mission, but with limited success. But there are a few promising theories, and the Indian Chandrayaan-2 orbiter may soon confirm which theory is correct. Interestingly,\u00a0Pravda published exact landing coordinates, but given the state of the art in 1966, those coordinates are unlikely to be completely correct. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter couldnt find it at that location. The leading candidates are within 5 to 25 km of the presumed site.\nThe Luna series had a number of firsts, including  probably  the distinction of being the first spacecraft stolen by a foreign government. Dont worry, though. They returned it. Since the Russians didnt talk much about plans or failures, you can wonder what they wanted to build but didnt. There were plenty of unbuilt dreams on the American side.\n\nFeatured Art  1:1 model of the Luna 9, Public Domain."}

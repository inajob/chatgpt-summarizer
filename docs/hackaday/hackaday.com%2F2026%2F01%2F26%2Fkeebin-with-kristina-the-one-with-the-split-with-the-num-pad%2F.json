The first, which is notably more complex, is shown here with its rings-of-Saturn thumb clusters.\nImage by [Rain2] via redditSo what was the impetus for this keyboard? Its simple: a friend mentioned that ergo keyboards are a no-go if you need a num pad really bad.\nSaturn has one built right in. The basic idea was to add a num pad while keeping the total number of keys to a minimum. Thanks to a mod key, this area can be many things, including but not limited to a num pad.\nAs far as the far-out shape goes, and I love that the curvature covers the thumb cluster and the index finger, [Rain2] wanted to get away from the traditional thumb cluster design. Be sure to check out the back of the boards in the image gallery.\nUnfortunately, this version is too complicated to make, so v2 does not have the cool collision shapes going for it. But it is still an excellent keyboard, and perhaps will be open source someday.\n\nPhanny Kicks Butt\nSay hello to Phanny, a custom 52-key wireless split from [SfBattleBeagle]. This interestingly-named board has a custom splay that they designed from the ground up along with PCBWay, who sponsored the PCBs in the first place.\nImage by [SfBattleBeagle] via GitHubI personally think the thumb keys go a little too far inward for my taste, but Im certain that [SfBattleBeagle]s hands must be different. Probably doesnt have these stubby little thumbs.\nWhile Ergogen is all the rage, [SfBattleBeagle] still opts to use Fusion and KiCad, preferring the UI of the average CAD program. If youre wondering about the lack of palm rests, the main reason is that [SfBattleBeagle] tends to bounce between screens, as well as moving between the split and the num pad. To that end, they are currently designing a pair of sliding wrist skates that I would love to hear more about.\nBe sure to check out the GitHub repo for all the details and a nice build guide. [SfBattleBeagle] says this is a fun project and results in a very comfy board.\nThe Centerfold: Mantis WIP is Captivating\nImage by [luckybipedal] via redditI love it when I can provide a lovely centerfold thats also got a lot of story behind it. This is Mantis, a work-in-progress by [luckybipedal] aka [Felix K\u00fchling]. You can read a lot more on GitHub, and the reasoning behind the design choices in [Felix]s write-up over on KBD News.\u00a0[Felix] expects to build the first prototypes in March or April, and publish a final design and build guide later this spring.\nVia reddit\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Masspro\nI must say, the Antikey Chop doesnt have much to say about the Masspro typewriter, and for good reason.\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nBut heres what we know: the Masspro was invented by a George Francis Rose, who was the son of Frank S. Rose, inventor of the Standard Folding Typewriter. That machine was the predecessor to the Corona No. 3.\nFrank died right as the Rose Typewriter Co. was starting to get somewhere. George took over, but then it needed financing pretty badly.\nAngel investor and congressman Bill Conger took over the company, relocated, and renamed it the Standard Folding Typewriter Co. According to the Antikey Chop, selling his fathers company was arguably Georges greatest contribution to typewriter history.\nGeorge Rose was an engineer like his father, but he was not very original when it came to typewriters. The Masspro is familiar yet foreign, and resembles the Corona Four. Although the patent was issued in 1925, production didnt begin until 1932, and likely ended within to years.\nImage via Oz Typewriter\nWhy? It was the wrong machine at the wrong time. Plus, it was poorly built, and bore a double-shift keyboard which was outdated by this time. And, oh yeah, the company was started during the Depression.\nBut I like the Masspro. I think my favorite part, aside from the open keyboard, is the logo, which looks either like hieroglyphics or letters chiseled into a stone tablet.\nI also like the textured firewall area where the logo is stamped. The Antikey Chop calls this a crinkle finish. Apparently, they came in black, blue, green, and red. The red isnt candy apple, its more of an ox-blood red, and thats just fine with me. Id love to see the blue and green, though. Oh, heres the green.\n\nFinally, a Trackball Mouse With Nice Switches\nOkay, so Keychrons new Nape Pro mouse is pretty darn cool, and this is the best picture I could find that actually shows how youre supposed to implement this thing on your desk. Otherwise, it looks like some kind of presentation remote.\nImage via Yanko Design\nSo the idea here is to never take your hands off the keyboard to mouse, although you can use it off to the side like a regular trackball if you want. I say the ability to leave your fingers on the home row is even better.\nThere are plenty of keyboards with trackpads and other mousing functions that let you do this. But maybe youre not ready to go that far. This mouse is a nice, easy first step.\nThe ball is pretty small at 25 mm. For comparison, the M575 uses a 34 mm ball, which is pretty common for trackball mice. Under those six buttons are quiet Huano micro switches, which makes sense, but I personally think loud-ish mice are nice enough.\nIve never given it much thought, but the switches on my Logitech M575 are nice and clicky. I wonder how these compare, but I dont see a sound sample. If the Nape Pro switches sound anything like this, then wowsers, that is quiet.\nImage via Yanko Design\nThe super-cool part here is the software and orientation system, which they call OctaShift. The thing knows how its positioned and can remap its functions to match. M1 and M2 are meant to be your primary mouse buttons, and they are reported to be comfortable to reach in any position.\nInside youll find a Realtek chip with a 1 kHz polling rate along with a PixArt PAW3222 sensor, which puts this mouse in the realm of decent wireless gaming mice. But the connectivity choice is yours between dongle, Bluetooth, and USB-C cable.\nAnd check this out: the firmware is ZMK, and Keychron plans to release the case STLs. Finally, it seems the mouse world is catching up with the keyboard world a bit.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two.

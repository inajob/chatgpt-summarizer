All is not lost though, because [jirka.luftner] has posted one on Instructables which eschews the fancy machined brass of the commercial models and achieves the same result with an array of salvaged parts.\nThe main cylinder is a former apple drops tin with a cardboard displacer, and the CD/DVD flywheel is mounted on either a 3D printed or cut out frame with the secondary cylinder cut into it. A diaphragm for the secondary cylinder is taken from a rubber glove, and the cranks come courtesy of bent wire.\nA slight mystery of this design is that it appears not to have a regenerator, or heat store. This usually lies in the path between the two cylinders to improve efficiency by taking the heat from the air as it passes in-between the two, and returning it when it goes the other way. Were guessing that on an engine this small its the tin itself which performs this function. Either way this is a neat little engine that shouldnt break the bank.\nIf this has whetted your appetite, youll be pleased to hear its not the first Stirling engine weve seen made from what was lying around.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\uff1a\u5ec3\u54c1\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308bStirling\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3002\u6750\u6599\u306f\u518d\u5229\u7528\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u305b\u305a\u3001\u71b1\u52b9\u7387\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u306f\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002\u524d\u4f8b\u306f\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u306f\u305c\u3072\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3092\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\uff1a\u5ec3\u54c1\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30ba\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305fDIY\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3", "\u8d08\u308a\u7269\u30ab\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3", "\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u3084\u3059\u3044\uff1a\u5ec9\u4fa1\u7248\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3"]}

This last feature is powered by SpaceAPI, a standard way for hackerspaces to publish information about themselves, including whether or not they are closed.\nGiven such a trove of data then its hardly surprising that [S3lph] would use it to create a gigantic map of central Europe with lights in the appropriate places (German language, Google Translate link) to show the spaces and their status.\nThe lights are a set of addressable LEDs and the brain is an ESP32, making this an accessible project for most hackers with the time to assemble it. Unsurprisingly then its not the first such map weve seen, though its considerably more ambitious than the last one. Meanwhile if your hackerspace doesnt have SpaceAPI yet or youre simply curious about the whole thing, we took a look at it back in 2021.\nThanks [Dave] for the tip.", "title": "- \u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u660e\u793a\u3059\u308b\u5de8\u5927LED\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u65c5\u884c\u4e2d\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u793a\u3059\u5730\u56f3\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002SpaceAPI\u3067\u60c5\u5831\u66f4\u65b0\u3002ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLED\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u660e\u793a\u3059\u308b\u5de8\u5927LED\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- SpaceAPI\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u72b6\u6cc1\u8868\u793a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u306f", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u63a2\u305b\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

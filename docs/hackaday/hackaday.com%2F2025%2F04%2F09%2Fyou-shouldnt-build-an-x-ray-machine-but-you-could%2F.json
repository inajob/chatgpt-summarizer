Of course you have! Many of us were indoctrinated with enticing ads for X-ray specs and if you like to see whats inside things, whats better than a machine that looks inside things? [Hyperspace Pirate] agrees, and he shows you the dangers of having your own X-ray machine in the video below.\nThe project starts with an X-ray tube and a high voltage supply. The tube takes around 70,000 volts which means you need a pretty stout supply, an interesting 3D printed resistor, and some mineral oil.\nThe output display? A normal camera. You also need an intensifying screen, which is just a screen with phosphor or something similar. He eventually puts everything in lead and reminds you that this is a very dangerous project and you should probably skip it unless you are certain you know how to deal with X-ray dangers.\nOverall, looks like a fun project. But if you want real credit, do like [Harry Simmons] and blow your own X-ray tube, too. We see people build similar machines from time to time. You shouldnt, but if you do, remember to be careful and to tell us about it!\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cX\u7dda\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5371\u967a\u6027", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eX\u7dda\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3084\u925b\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cX\u7dda\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5371\u967a\u6027", "- \u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fX\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3067\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308bX\u7dda\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u86cd\u5149\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fX\u7dda\u89b3\u5bdf", "- \u81ea\u4f5cX\u7dda\u7ba1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u969b\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u3068\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

The little off-roader wasnt up to scratch\u2014despite its four-wheel-drive, it couldnt get over rough ground to save its life. Thus, it was time to 3D-print a better chassis that could actually get through it!\nThe problem was quite obvious. With no suspension and a rigid chassis, the vehicle would tend to end up with one or more wheels on the air on rough surfaces. To rectify this, [Azpaca] created a twisting chassis which would allow the wheels to better remain in contact with the ground. The design is relatively straightforward, and reuses much of the original drivetrain, including the simple brushed motor. However, with a pivot right behind the front wheels, it has much more traction on rocks and gravel, and can traverse these terrains much more easily.\nTamiyas motorized toys arent particularly well known in the West, but its neat to see the community that exists around modifying them around the world.\u00a0Design files are available for the curious. If youre not down with mods, perhaps youd prefer to print your own cars from scratch. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6539\u826f\uff01Tamiya\u306e\u30c8\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "Tamiya\u306e\u30c8\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30b5\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4ed8\u304d\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6539\u826f\uff01Tamiya\u306e\u30c8\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30b5\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306a\u3057\uff1f\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u3067\u30aa\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a", "- Tamiya\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30c9\u30c8\u30a4\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- \u5730\u5f62\u3092\u514b\u670d\uff01\u30c8\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5411\u4e0a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- DIY\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

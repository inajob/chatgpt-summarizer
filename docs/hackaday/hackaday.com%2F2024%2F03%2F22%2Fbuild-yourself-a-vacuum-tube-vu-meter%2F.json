For some reason, humans just dig lights that flash along with sounds. You can build a VU meter using LEDs, or bulbs if youre trapped in 1972. Or, you could use special vacuum tubes. [mircemk] did just that in their latest VU meter project.\nThe 6E2 vacuum tube is the part for the job in this case. You might think a specialist tube like this is expensive, but they can be had for just a few dollars from online retailers. They were often used as tuning indicators, but here, theyre used as a responsive VU meter instead. However, instead of a single bar going up and down, you get a pair of bars that raise to meet in the middle.\n[mircemk] explains all the circuitry required to drive the tubes, and how to hook them up to create a two-channel stereo VU meter. The final circuit largely relies on a transistor, a diode, some passive components, and a DC-DC boost supply to generate 250 V for the tubes.\nThe final result looks pretty neat, particularly as its built into an old-school blue project box. Weve seen similar projects from [mircemk] before, too. \n", "title": "\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u300cVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306fLED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u30011972\u5e74\u306b\u9589\u3058\u8fbc\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306f\u96fb\u7403\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306f\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba16E2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aaVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001250V\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308bDC-DC\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u4f9b\u7d66\u3092\u542b\u3080\u3002\u300d", "titles": ["\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f2\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aaVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u624b\u9806", "LED\u3084\u96fb\u7403\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fVU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1VU\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f"]}

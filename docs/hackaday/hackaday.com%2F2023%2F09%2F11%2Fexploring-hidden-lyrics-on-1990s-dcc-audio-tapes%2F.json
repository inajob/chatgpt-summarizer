Despite being billed as the successor to Philips original analog Compact Cassette format from 1963, DCC was short-lived and slipped away after only four years in 1996. [Techmoan] obtained a unique cassette that purports to be the only known published DCC tape which contains embedded song lyrics that scroll on the DCC players tiny screen in sync with the music  Size Isnt Everything by the Bee Gees from 1993. Sure enough, he is able to demonstrate this in the video down below the break.\nBut, theres more. For reasons unclear, this only happens on on this one Bee Gees album. But it turns out that many DCC tapes did in fact include lots of other metadata, and sometimes lyrics as well. But these were only visible using an unreleased Philips system called Interactive Text Transmission System (ITTS). It just so happens that the folks at the DCC Museum obtained a Philips prototype ITTS box and have been gradually hacking the protocol.\nTrack Listing Using Blocky Graphics\n[Techmoan] demonstrates a modernized prototype version from Germany designed by [Thomas Falkner] called the ITTS video box NG. Using this, he runs through a bunch of DCC tapes from his collection, and finds a significant number of them were published with lyrics and metadata, presumably in anticipation of as ITTS launch. Its interesting to see how some publishers spent a lot of effort to format this information and others seemed to just copy / paste over the bare minimum.\nThe more elaborate pages resemble what you might see on your teletext screens back in the day. On those albums that do have lyrics, the presentation can be different, as well. Lyrics from the Bee Gees album appear like text scrolling up on a terminal, with current phrases shown in yellow. Another albums lyrics can be scrolled in different peculiar ways, including a one-word-at-a-time mode.\nIf this kind of historical dive into technology interests you, check out the talk that [Jac] and [Ralf] gave at the 2022 Supercon about DCC, and this video from 2018 where [Ralf] digs deeper into this topic. Also, [Jac] has some more recent details on hacking the protocol posted over on his Hackaday.io project page. If you want a more basic introduction to DCC, [Techmoan] introduced this format some years ago on his YouTube channel.\n\n", "title": "1993\u5e74\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305fBee Gees\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u300eSize Isnt Everything\u300f\u306b\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308bDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u7279\u6b8a\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "Techmoan\u306f\u30011992\u5e74\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305fPhilips Digital Compact Cassette (DCC)\u5f62\u5f0f\u306b\u518d\u3073\u6ce8\u76ee\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002DCC\u306f\u30011963\u5e74\u306ePhilips\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u5f62\u5f0f\u306e\u5f8c\u7d99\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3065\u3051\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u308f\u305a\u304b4\u5e74\u9593\u3067\u6d88\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Techmoan\u306f\u3001Bee Gees\u306e1993\u5e74\u306e\u697d\u66f2\u300cSize Isnt Everything\u300d\u304c\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u552f\u4e00\u306eDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3057\u3001DCC\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u753b\u9762\u306b\u6b4c\u8a5e\u304c\u97f3\u697d\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001DCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3084\u6b4c\u8a5e\u3082\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306f\u672a\u767a\u58f2\u306ePhilips\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3042\u308bInteractive Text Transmission System\uff08ITTS\uff09\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u306e\u307f\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002Techmoan\u306f\u3001Thomas Falkner\u304c\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u305fITTS\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9NG\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u8eab\u306e\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u306eDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u5b9f\u6f14\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1993\u5e74\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305fBee Gees\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u300eSize Isnt Everything\u300f\u306b\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308bDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u7279\u6b8a\u6a5f\u80fd", "Philips\u306e\u672a\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0ITTS\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305fDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u6b4c\u8a5e\u3068\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u3067\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305fITTS\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9NG\u306b\u3088\u308bDCC\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u518d\u751f\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30d3\u30fc\u30fb\u30b8\u30fc\u30ba\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u306e\u6b4c\u8a5e\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "DCC\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u60c5\u5831\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30c0\u30a4\u30d6"]}

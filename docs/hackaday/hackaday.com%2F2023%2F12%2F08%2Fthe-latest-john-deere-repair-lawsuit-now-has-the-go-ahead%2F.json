It may be hot stuff on the prairies, but it matters to everyone because its a key right-to-repair battleground. Now the companys attempt to throw out the latest class-action lawsuit, this time in Illinois. has failed, paving the way for a meaningful challenge.\nThis lawsuit is special because has the aim of determining whether or not Deere conspired to drive up the cost of repair and edge out independent mechanics. It comes against a backdrop in which their promised access to repair software which we reported on back in January has failed to materialize, and this is likely to figure as an act of bad faith.\nA failing of corporate culture is that the organisation can in its own eyes, never be wrong. In Deeres case they have accrued plenty of bad publicity in the years theyve pursued this ill-advised business model, and in case that werent enough theyve alienated their core customers out on the farms to the extent that a second-hand Deere from before the DRM era has more value than its newer counterparts. Deere genuinely do make very good tractors, so for farmers loyal for generations to turn their backs on them is a very significant story indeed. One has to ask, how much bad publicity and how many lawsuits do they have to have before someone at head office in Moline figures out that DRM in tractors (or anything else for that matter) isnt the great idea they once thought it was? Maybe this one will finally herald the moment when that happens.\nHeader image: Nheyob / CC BY-SA 4.0"}

A real hand cannon, if you will. Its officially called the\u00a0Mega Buster,\u00a0and [Arnov Sharma] recently recreated it for cosplay purposes.\nKey to any good cosplay build is getting the visuals right, and [Arnov] achieved that well. The Mega Buster was first recreated in Fusion 360, scaled to an appropriate size to fit [Arnov]s arm. It was 3D printed in several sections, with the body including a grab handle and fire button inside, and the side panel and blaster nozzle having provision for installing LEDs. The former is the blasters power meter which shows how many shots it has left until it runs out of energy, with the blaster able to fire six times before needing to cooldown. A Raspberry Pi Pico controls the LEDs and provides sound effects with the aid of a PAM8403 class D amplifier module and a small speaker.\nThe 3D files are available on Instructables for the curious. Perhaps by virtue of its arm-mounted nature, this build reminds us of the venerable Pip Boy from Fallout, of which weve seen many grand recreations before. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u7528\u30e1\u30ac\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30ce\u30d6\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30de\u6c0f\u304c\u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u7528\u306b\u30e1\u30ac\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u3001LED\u3068\u97f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u7528\u30e1\u30ac\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLED\u5236\u5fa1\u3068\u97f3\u97ff\u52b9\u679c", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6b66\u5668", "- \u30e1\u30ac\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u3001\u30e1\u30ac\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u88c5\u5099\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u516c\u958b\u60c5\u5831"]}

[Ed\u2019s Garage] has taken a module from a salvaged EV and turned it into a handy portable power station.\nWith 2.3 kWh of storage from the single Spark EV module, the battery pack can power [Ed]s hotplate, lights, fridge, and other electric accessories while camping away from shore power. The inverter he selected can provide up to 1500W of AC power and his 12V converter can do 150W. Several USB ports and a wireless charging pad adorn the outside next to the waterproof AC ports. He even printed a small magnetic flashlight to reuse the light from the inverter which uses an 18650 cell that can be charged from the big battery in a charger built into the exterior of the pack.\nThe battery management system (BMS) has a Bluetooth module allowing for remote monitoring of state of charge and setting the maximum and minimum charge points for the pack. The whole thing comes in at 73 pounds (33 kg), and while he had originally thought to give it wheels to roll, he changed his mind once he thought more about what sort of wheels hed need to maneuver the thing in the backcountry.\nIf youre thinking of building your own power pack, why not checkout a few other builds for inspiration like this one from tool batteries or one designed to charge directly from a solar panel. Be sure you checkout our guide on how to select a BMS if youre going to use a lithium-based chemistry.\n\n", "title": "EV\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u7528\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Car camping\u3067\u5916\u3067\u904e\u3054\u3059\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3092\u5473\u308f\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u304b\u3089\u5c11\u3057\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3061\u8fbc\u3080\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002Ed's Garage\u306fEV\u304b\u3089\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u643a\u5e2f\u7528\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u5909\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30022.3 kWh\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u96fb\u5316\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["EV\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u7528\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30ea\u30e6\u30fc\u30b9\u53ef\u80fd\u306aEV\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9BMS\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u6e90\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u7528\u9014\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u96fb\u6e90\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

However, if you havent noticed, unlimited free storage is hard to find. We arent sure if he wants to use the tool he built seriously, but he decided that if he could encode data in a video format, he could store his files on YouTube. Does it work? It does, and you can find the code on GitHub.\nOf course, the efficiency isnt very good. A 7 K image, for example, yielded a 9-megabyte video. If we were going to store files on YouTube, wed encrypt them, too, making it even worse.\nThe first attempt was to break the file into pieces and encode them as QR codes. Makes sense, but it didnt work out. To get enough data into each frame, the modules (think pixels) in the QR code were small. Combined with video compression, the system was unreliable.\nSimplicity rules. Each frame is 19201080 and uses a black pixel as a one and a white pixel as a zero. In theory, this gives about 259 kbytes per frame. However, to help avoid problems decoding due to video compression, the real bits use a 55 pixel block, so that means you get about 10 kbytes of data per frame.\nThe code isnt perfect. It can add things to the end of a file, for example, but that would be easy to fix. The protocol could use error correction and compression. You might even build encryption into it or store more data  old school cassette-style  using the audio channel. Still, as a proof of concept, it is pretty neat.\nThis might sound like a new idea, but people way back in the early home computer days could back up data to VCRs. This isnt even the first time weve seen it done with YouTube.", "title": "YouTube\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u9650\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092YouTube\u306b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u306f\u52b9\u7387\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3078\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u5206\u5272\u306f\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u3002\u52d5\u753b\u306e1\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u304c1\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306710 kbytes\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3054\u3068\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["YouTube\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u52d5\u753b\u5f62\u5f0f\u306b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066YouTube\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58", "QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f1\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u7b26\u53f7\u5316", "\u8aa4\u308a\u691c\u51fa\u3084\u5727\u7e2e\u306a\u3069\u306e\u6539\u5584\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "YouTube\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u624b\u6cd5"]}

This take on a PCB business card, sent in by [VCC], tackles one of the big challenges with them: making them in such a way that they are cheap enough to not feel bad about handing them out.\n\nThese cards plug into a USB port for power and have over a dozen small LEDs that light up the stars on the front, and a small buzzer that can play over ten minutes of cracktro music. To keep the cost down, [VCC] went with an ATtiny1616 microcontroller costing under 50 cents and still having plenty of outputs to drive the buzzer and LEDs. The final per-unit cost prior to shipping came out to only 1.5 euros, enabling them to be handed out without worrying about breaking the bank.\nTo aid in the assembly of the cards, [VCC] 3D printed a jig to apply material to the back of the USB connector, building up its thickness to securely fit in the USB port. He also wrote a small script for assembly-line programming the cards, getting the programming process down to around ten seconds per card and letting him turn through prepping the cards. Thanks, [VCC], for sending in your project\u2014its a great addition to other PCB business cards weve featured.\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30a8\u30b3\u3067\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01LED\u3068\u97f3\u697d\u4ed8\u304dPCB\u540d\u523a\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "PCB\u540d\u523a\u306f\u6280\u8853\u3092\u30a2\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306b\u88fd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002USB\u3067LED\u304c\u5149\u308a\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3082\u518d\u751f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a8\u30b3\u3067\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01LED\u3068\u97f3\u697d\u4ed8\u304dPCB\u540d\u523a\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u629c\u7fa4\u306eUSB\u540d\u523a\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- ATtiny1616\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u540d\u523a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30b0\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308bPCB\u540d\u523a\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u77ed\u6642\u9593\u3067\u5b8c\u6210\uff01\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308b\u540d\u523a\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u5316"]}

But thats OK, because if theres something smaller than this nearly microscopic LED blinky build, we definitely want to know about it.\nThe reason behind [Mike Roller]s build is simple: he wanted to build something smaller than the previous smallest blinky. The 3.2-mm x 2.5-mm footprint of that effort is a tough act to follow, but technology has advanced somewhat in the last seven years, and [Mike] took advantage of that by basing his design on an ATtiny20 microcontroller in a WLCSP package and an 0201 LED, along with a current-limiting resistor and a decoupling capacitor. Powering the project is a 220-\u03bcF tantalum capacitor, which at a relatively whopping 3.2 mm x 1.6 mm determines the size of the PCB, which [Mike] insisted on using.\nAssembling the project was challenging, to say the least. [Mike] originally tried a laboratory hot plate to reflow the board, but when the magnetic stirrer played havoc with the parts, he switched to a hot-air rework station with a very low airflow. Programming the microcontroller almost seemed like it was more of a challenge; when the pogo pins he was planning to use proved too large for the job he tacked leads made from 38-gauge magnet wire to the board with the aid of a micro hot air tool.\nAfter building version one, [Mike] realized that even smaller components were available, so theres now a 2.4 mm x 1.5 mm version using an 01005 LED. We suspect therell be a version 3.0 soon, though  he mentions that the new TI ultra-small microcontrollers werent available yet when he pulled this off, and no doubt hell want to take a stab at this again."}

But thats OK, because if theres something smaller than this nearly microscopic LED blinky build, we definitely want to know about it.\nThe reason behind [Mike Roller]s build is simple: he wanted to build something smaller than the previous smallest blinky. The 3.2-mm x 2.5-mm footprint of that effort is a tough act to follow, but technology has advanced somewhat in the last seven years, and [Mike] took advantage of that by basing his design on an ATtiny20 microcontroller in a WLCSP package and an 0201 LED, along with a current-limiting resistor and a decoupling capacitor. Powering the project is a 220-\u03bcF tantalum capacitor, which at a relatively whopping 3.2 mm x 1.6 mm determines the size of the PCB, which [Mike] insisted on using.\nAssembling the project was challenging, to say the least. [Mike] originally tried a laboratory hot plate to reflow the board, but when the magnetic stirrer played havoc with the parts, he switched to a hot-air rework station with a very low airflow. Programming the microcontroller almost seemed like it was more of a challenge; when the pogo pins he was planning to use proved too large for the job he tacked leads made from 38-gauge magnet wire to the board with the aid of a micro hot air tool.\nAfter building version one, [Mike] realized that even smaller components were available, so theres now a 2.4 mm x 1.5 mm version using an 01005 LED. We suspect therell be a version 3.0 soon, though  he mentions that the new TI ultra-small microcontrollers werent available yet when he pulled this off, and no doubt hell want to take a stab at this again.", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306eLED\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "body": "\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306eLED\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305fMike Roller\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3002\u7d042.4mm\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3082\u767b\u5834\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5c0f\u306eLED\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3ATtiny20\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u5922\u306e2.4mm x 1.5mm\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u6311\u3080\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30d6\u30ea\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ea\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6280\u8853\u9769\u65b0\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u7e54\u308a\u306a\u3059\u672a\u6765\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

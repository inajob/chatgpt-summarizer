Show us what you can do in the realm of hacking for the planet, be it solar-based, wind-powered, recycled-trash-powered  you get the idea.\nKristina is now completely down for the count on Whats That Sound, although this week, she was sort of in the neighborhood. But no matter, because we know several of you will nail it. Then its on to the hacks, where we have quite a bit to say this week when it comes to cars.\nFrom there we take a look at a really fun gumball run, ponder the uses of leafy meats, and fawn over an Amiga-inspired build. Finally we talk PCB earring art, hacking the IKEA Kvart, and discuss the potential uses for wind-to-heat power.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0 the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\n\nEpisode 225 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Prize 2023: This Challenge Makes It So Easy Being Green\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nKnow the sound?

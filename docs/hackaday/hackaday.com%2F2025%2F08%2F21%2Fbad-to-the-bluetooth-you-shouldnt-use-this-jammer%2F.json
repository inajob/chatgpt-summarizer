But these days youre far more likely to hear somebodys Bluetooth device blasting than you are an unruly FM radio.\nTo combat this aural menace, [Tixlegeek] is here with a jammer for the 2.4 GHz spectrum to make annoying Bluetooth devices go silent. While its not entirely effective, its still of interest for its unashamed jankiness. Besides, you really shouldnt be using one of these anyway, so it doesnt really matter how well it works.\nRaiding the AliExpress 2.4 GHz parts bin, theres a set of NRF24L01+ modules that jump around all over the band, a couple of extremely sketchy-looking power amplifiers, and a pair of Yagi antennas. Its not even remotely legal, and we particularly like the sentence After running the numbers, I realized it would be cheaper and far more effective to just throw a rock at [the Bluetooth speaker]. If theres a lesson here, perhaps it is that effective jamming comes in disrupting the information flow rather than drowning it out.\nThis project may be illegal, but unlike some others we think it (probably) wont kill you."}

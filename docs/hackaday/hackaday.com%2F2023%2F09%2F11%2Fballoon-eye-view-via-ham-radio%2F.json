One of the things is how do you stream video down so that you  and others  can enjoy the fruits of your labor? Youll find advice on that and more in a recent post from [scd31]. Youll at least enjoy the real-time video recorded from the launch that you can see below.\nThe video is encoded with a Raspberry Pi 4 using H264. The MPEG-TS stream feeds down using 70 cm ham radio gear. If you are interested in this sort of thing, software, including flight and ground code, is on the Internet. There is software for the Pi, an STM32, plus the packages youll need for the ground side.\nWe love high-altitude balloons here at Hackaday. San Francisco High Altitude Ballooning (SF-HAB) launched a pair during last years Supercon, which attendees were able to track online. We dont suggest you try to put a crew onboard, but theres a long and dangerous history of people who did.\n\n"}

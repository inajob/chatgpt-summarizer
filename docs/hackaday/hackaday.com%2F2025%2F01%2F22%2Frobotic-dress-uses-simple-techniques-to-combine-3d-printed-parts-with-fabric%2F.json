[anoukwipprecht] created something a little more technological and confronting, though, with the Robotic Open-Source Scale Dress.\nRight from the drop, you can see what the dress is all about. Its an open-shoulder design that has eight large moving scales mounted on the front. These scales are printed, and each features its own servo for independent movement. The scale baseplates are designed to hide the servos themselves, creating a sleeker look that hides the mechanism underneath. Each baseplate is also perforated with holes, allowing it to be sewn on to the base garment in a stout fashion. The dress itself is created with thick neoprene fabric, enabling it to take the weight of the scale assemblies without sagging or pulling away from the body. You can even customize the scales in various ways\u2014such as adding feathers instead.\nThe dress is a neat piece, and would catch eyes for its pointy scales alone. The fact that they can start moving at any time only increases the garments impact. Weve seen some other great fashionable uses of 3D printing before, too, like these awesome printed shoes. Meanwhile, if youre printing your own garments in your home lab, dont hesitate to let us know! Or, even better wear them to the next Hackaday event!", "title": "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u8863\u88c5\u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u300d\u306f\u3001\u52d5\u304f\u9c57\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002\u72ec\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u3067\u53ef\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u52d5\u304f\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6301\u3064\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u8863\u670d", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u8863\u88c5\u3068\u306f"]}

But we can sometimes forget that whats easy for the tinkerer that reads datasheets for fun isnt always so straightforward for everyone else. Which is why its so refreshing to see projects like this LED chandelier from [MakerMan].\nDespite the impressive final result, theres no microcontrollers or complex electronics at work here. Its been pieced together, skillfully we might add, from hardware that wouldnt be out of place in a well-stocked parts bin. No 3D printed parts or fancy laser cutter involved, and even the bits that are welded together could certainly be fastened some other way if necessary. This particular build is not a triumph of technology, but ingenuity.\nThe video below is broken up roughly into two sections, the first shows how the motorized crank and pulley system was designed and tested; complete with various bits of scrip standing in for the final LED light tubes. Once the details for how it would move were nailed down, [MakerMan] switches over to producing the lights themselves, which are nothing more than some frosted plastic tubes with LED strips run down the center. Add in a sufficiently powerful 12 VDC supply, and youre pretty much done.\nAs it so happens, this isnt the first motorized lighting fixture that [MakerMan] has put together.\n\n"}

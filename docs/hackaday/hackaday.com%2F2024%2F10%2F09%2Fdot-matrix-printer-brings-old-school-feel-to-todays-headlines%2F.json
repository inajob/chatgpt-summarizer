Now, most of us get our news piped directly into our phones, selected by algorithms perfectly tuned to rile us up on whatever the hot-button issue du jour happens to be. Welcome to the future.\nIf like us you long for a simpler way to get your news, [Andrew Schmelyun] has a partial solution with this dot-matrix news feeder. Its part of his effort to detox a bit from the whole algorithm thing and make the news a little more concrete. He managed to chase down a very old Star Micronics printer with a serial interface, which he got on the cheap thanks to the previous owner not being sure if it worked. It did, at least after some cleaning, and thanks to a USB-to-serial and the efforts of Linux kernel hackers through the ages, was able to echo output to the printer from a Raspberry Pi Zero W.\nFrom there, getting a daily news feed was as simple as writing some PHP code to mine the APIs of a few selected services. Were perplexed and alarmed to report that Hackaday is not among the selected sources, but were sure this was just a small oversight that will be corrected in version 2. The program runs as a cron job so that a dead-tree version of the days top stories is ready for [Andrew]s morning coffee.\nWeve seen similar news printers before; we particularly like this roll-feed paper version. But for a seriously retro feel, wed love to see this done on a real teletype."}

Now, most of us get our news piped directly into our phones, selected by algorithms perfectly tuned to rile us up on whatever the hot-button issue du jour happens to be. Welcome to the future.\nIf like us you long for a simpler way to get your news, [Andrew Schmelyun] has a partial solution with this dot-matrix news feeder. Its part of his effort to detox a bit from the whole algorithm thing and make the news a little more concrete. He managed to chase down a very old Star Micronics printer with a serial interface, which he got on the cheap thanks to the previous owner not being sure if it worked. It did, at least after some cleaning, and thanks to a USB-to-serial and the efforts of Linux kernel hackers through the ages, was able to echo output to the printer from a Raspberry Pi Zero W.\nFrom there, getting a daily news feed was as simple as writing some PHP code to mine the APIs of a few selected services. Were perplexed and alarmed to report that Hackaday is not among the selected sources, but were sure this was just a small oversight that will be corrected in version 2. The program runs as a cron job so that a dead-tree version of the days top stories is ready for [Andrew]s morning coffee.\nWeve seen similar news printers before; we particularly like this roll-feed paper version. But for a seriously retro feel, wed love to see this done on a real teletype.", "title": "\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc: \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "TV\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u771f\u5263\u3055\u3092\u5f37\u8abf\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u304b\u3064\u3066\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3092\u899a\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u3001\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u76f4\u63a5\u5165\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u304c\u9078\u3093\u3060\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u79c1\u9054\u3092\u8208\u596e\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc: \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9", "\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe: \u6614\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306e\u5370\u5237\u6a5f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c6\u30ec\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3067\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u53d7\u4fe1: \u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306eUSB\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9: Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u306e\u89e3\u653e: \u679c\u305f\u3057\u3066\u3053\u308c\u304c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u304b\uff1f"]}

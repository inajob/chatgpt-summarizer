In fact, he mentions it was made for outdoor signage. Removing the rear panel didnt help much  the entire unit was potted in resin  but that didnt stop [Clive]. Removing the resin revealed only a few components surrounded by a sand-like substance.\nTheres no circuit board inside. Components are just wired together before potting. The significant player inside is a metal oxide varistor with a thermal fuse. [Clive] draws out a schematic, which is deceptively simple. The two LEDs are an older style of green LED, and he explains why the choice of LED is important in this application. In typical operation, the LEDs light. If a fuse blows, at least one of the LEDs will extinguish.\nNot all useful circuits have to be complicated. This is an excellent example of how a simple but well-constructed design can succeed commercially.\nNot all surge protectors are built this well. If you need a refresher on how varistors work, we can help with that.\n\n", "title": "\u5546\u7528\u7528\u9014\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "body": "\u5546\u7528\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u89e3\u4f53\u3002\u57fa\u677f\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3057\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u8986\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u306f\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u9178\u5316\u7269\u30d0\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u3068\u71b1\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u3067\u30012\u3064\u306eLED\u3068\u9069\u5207\u306a\u9078\u629e\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u5546\u696d\u7684\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3059\u4f8b\u3002\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u304c\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3088\u304f\u3067\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u5546\u7528\u7528\u9014\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6a39\u8102\u3067\u8986\u3063\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u3082\u5546\u696d\u7684\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u56de\u8def\u57fa\u677f\u306a\u3057\uff1f\uff01", "\u30d0\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u3068\u30b5\u30fc\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f"]}

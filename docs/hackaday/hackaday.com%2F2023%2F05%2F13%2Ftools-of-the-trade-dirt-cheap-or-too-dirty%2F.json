Actually, it\u2019s not even close. It claims to be a 100 MHz scope, and it\u2019s got around 30 MHz of bandwidth instead. If you bought it for higher frequency work, you\u2019d have every right to be angry. But it\u2019s also cheap enough that, if you were on a very tight budget, and you knew its limitations beforehand, you might be tempted to buy it anyway. Or so goes one rationale.\nIn principle, I\u2019m of the \u201cbuy cheap, buy twice\u201d mindset. Some tools, especially ones that you\u2019re liable to use a lot, make it worth your while to save up for the good stuff. (And for myself, I would absolutely put an oscilloscope in that category.) The chances that you\u2019ll outgrow or outlive the cheaper tool and end up buying the better one eventually makes the money spent on the cheaper tool simply wasted.\nBut that\u2019s not always the case either, and that\u2019s where you have to know yourself. If you\u2019re only going to use it a couple times, and it\u2019s not super critical, maybe it\u2019s fine to get the cheap stuff. Or if you know you\u2019re going to break it in the process of learning anyway, maybe it\u2019s a shame to put the gold-plated version into your noob hands. Or maybe you simply don\u2019t know if an oscilloscope is for you. It\u2019s possible!\nAnd you can mix and match. I just recently bought tools for changing our car\u2019s tires. It included a dirt-cheap pneumatic jack and an expensive torque wrench. My logic? The jack is relatively easy to make functional, and the specs are so wildly in excess of what I need that even if it\u2019s all lies, it\u2019ll probably suffice. The torque wrench, on the other hand, is a bit of a precision instrument, and it\u2019s pretty important that the bolts are socked up tight enough. I don\u2019t want the wheels rolling off as I drive down the road.\nPoint is, I can see both sides of the argument. And in the specific case of the \u2019scope, the cheapo one can also be battery powered, which gives it a bit of a niche functionality when probing live-ground circuits. Still, if you\u2019re marginally \u2019scope-curious, I\u2019d say save up your pennies for something at least mid-market. (Rigol? Used Agilent or Tek?)\nBut isn\u2019t it cool that we have so many choices? Where do you buy cheap? Where wont you?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

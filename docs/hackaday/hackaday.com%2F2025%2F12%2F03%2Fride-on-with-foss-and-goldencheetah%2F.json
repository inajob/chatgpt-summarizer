Its not perfect by any means, but there are enough open or open-ish standards for many different pieces of technology from different brands to interoperate with each other, from sensors and bike computers and even indoor trainers to some extent. This has also made it possible for open source software to exist in this realm as well, and the GoldenCheetah project has jumped in for all of us who value FOSS and also like to ride various bicycles from time to time.\nGoldenCheetah focuses on gathering data from power meters, allowing cyclists to record their rides and save them in order to keep track of their training performance over time. It works well with sensors that use the ANT+ protocol, and once it has that data it can provide advanced analytics such as power curves, critical power modeling, and detailed charts for power, heart rate, and cadence. It can display and record live indoor-training data, and in some situations it can even run interval workouts, although not every indoor trainer is supported. There are no social features, subscriptions, or cloud requirements which can be refreshing in the modern world, but is a bit of a downside if youre used to riding with your friends in something like Zwift.\nAll in all, though, its an impressive bit of software that encourages at least one realm of consumer electronics to stay more open, especially if those using bike sensors, computers, and trainers pick ones that are more open and avoid those that are proprietary, even if they dont plan to use GoldenCheetah exclusively. And if you were wondering about the ANT+ protocol mentioned earlier, its actually used for many more things that just intra-bike wireless communications.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "body": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u6a19\u6e96\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001GoldenCheetah\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u89e3\u6790\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- GoldenCheetah: \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- ANT+\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u9593\u306e\u76f8\u4e92\u904b\u7528\u6027\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3068GoldenCheetah\u306e\u4fa1\u5024"]}

Since the 20th century though, powerful batteries have become cheap, as have servos and radio controllers. Combine them with a bit of old packing material and you can get a little RC trainer up and running for peanuts, as [Samm Sheperd] demonstrates.\n[Samm] started referring to this as the $5 trainer, though he admits that it will cost more than that if you dont have some bits and pieces laying around. He demonstrates how to cut cheap foamboard with a hot guitar string, and how to form it into a viable wing. Thats the most crucial part, with the fuselage and tail surfaces relatively simple by comparison. With that complete, its as simple as bolting on a motor, some servos, and control horns, and youre up and running. You can even whip up a landing gear if youre so inclined! Then, figure out your center of gravity, get it right, and then youre pretty much ready to fly.\nIts a great primer on how to build a basic RC model, and if you do it right, it should have pretty forgiving handling, too. Plus, its so cheap that it should be easy to repair if you crash. Happy modelling! Video after the break.\n\n"}

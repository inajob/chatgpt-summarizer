Thanks to the constant stream of tips and updates we receive from the community, weve got a better than average view of whats on the mind of hardware hackers, engineers, and hobbyists.\nThis symbiotic relationship is something we take great pride in, which is why we also use this time of year to remind the readers just how much we appreciate them. We know it sounds line a line, but we really couldnt do it without you. So whether youve just started reading in 2024 or been with us for years, everyone here at Hackaday thanks you for being part of something special. Were keenly aware of how fortunate we are to still be running a successful blog in the era of YouTube and TikTok, and thats all because people like you keep coming back. If you keep reading it, well keep writing it.\nSo lets take a trip down memory lane and go over just a handful of the stories that kept us talking in 2024. Did we miss your favorite? Feel free to share with the class in the comments.\n\nBoeings Bungles\nWell start off with what was undoubtedly one of the biggest stories in the tech and engineering world, although youll find little mention of it on the pages of Hackaday up until now. Were talking, of course, of the dramatic and repeated failures of the once unassailable Boeing.\nAs a general rule, we dont really like running negative stories. Its just not the vibe we try and cultivate. Unless we can bring something new to the discussion, wed rather leave other outlets peddle in doom and gloom. So thats why, after considerable internal debate at HQ, we ultimately never wrote a story about the now infamous Alaska Airlines door plug incident at the beginning of the year.\nNor did we cover the repeated delays of Boeings Starliner capsule, a crewed spacecraft that the company was paid $4.2 billion to build under NASAs Commercial Crew Program  nearly double the sum SpaceX received for the development of their Crew Dragon.\nThings only got worse once the capsule finally left the launch pad in June. With human lives in the balance, it seemed in poor taste for us to cover Starliners disastrous first crewed flight to the International Space Station. The mission was so fraught with technical issues that NASA made the unprecedented decision to send the capsule back to Earth without its crew onboard. Those two astronauts, Barry E. Wilmore and Sunita Williams, still remain on the ISS; their planned eight-day jaunt to the Station has now been extended until March of 2025, at which point theyll be riding home on SpaceXs capsule.\nWe wont speculate on what exactly is happening at Boeing, although weve heard some absolutely hair-raising stories from sources who wish to remain anonymous. Suffice to say, as disheartening as it might be for us on the outside to see such a storied company repeatedly fumble, its even worse for the those on the inside.\nDesktop 3D Printing Reshuffling\nWhile the tectonic shifts in the desktop 3D printer market didnt start last year, 2024 really seemed to be the point where it boiled over. For years the market had been at a standstill, with consumers essentially having two paths forward depending on what they were willing to spend.\nHad $200 or $300 to play with? Youd buy something like an Ender 3, a capable enough machine if you were willing to put in the time and effort. Or if you could stand to part with $800, you brought a Prusa i3, and didnt worry about the little details like bed leveling or missed steps because it was automated enough to just work most of the time.\nBut then, Bambu Labs showed up. Founded by an ex-DJI engineer, the Chinese company introduced a line of printers that might as well have come from the future. Their speed, ease of use, and features were beyond even what Prusa was offering, and yet they cost nearly half as much. Seemingly overnight, the the market leaders at both ends of the spectrum were beat at their own game, and the paradigm shifted. The cheap printers now seemed archaic in comparison, and Prusas machines overpriced.\nBut while Bambus printers have dazzled consumers, they bring along some unfortunate baggage. Suddenly 3D printing involves cloud connectivity, proprietary components, and hardware that was designed for production rather than repairability. In short, desktop 3D printing seems on the verge of breaking into the legitimate mainstream, with all the downsides that comes with it these days.\nIts wasnt all bad news though. When the community started experimenting with running alternate firmware on their hardware, Bambus response was better than wed feared: users would be allowed to modify their firmware, but would have to waive their warranty. Its not a perfect solution, but considering Prusa did more or less the same thing in 2019 when they released the Mini, the community had already shown they would accept the compromise.\nSpeaking of Prusa, feelings on how theyve decided to respond to this newfound competition have been mixed, to put it mildly. In developing their new Core ONE printer it looks like theyve engineered a worthy opponent for Bambus X1, but unfortunately, it appears the company has all but abandoned their open source hardware roots in the process.\nRP2350 Has a Rocky Start\nThe release of the Pi Pico development board made our list of highlights for 2021, and in the intervening years, the RP2040 microcontroller at its heart has become a favorite of makers and hackers. Weve even used it for the last two Supercon badges at this point. So the fact that its successor made this years list should come as no surprise.\nBut while the release of the Pi Pico 2 over the summer was noteworthy in its own way, it wasnt really the big story. Its what happened after that triggered debate in the community. You see, the RP2350 microcontroller that powered the Pico 2 launched with a known bug affecting the internal pull-down resistors. A bug that Hackaday alumn Ian Lesnet started documenting while incorporating the chip into a new version of the Bus Pirate. It turned out the scope of said bug was actually a lot worse than the documentation indicated, a fact that the folks at Raspberry Pi didnt seem keen to acknowledge at first.\nUltimately, the erratum for the RP2350 was amended to better describe the nature of the issue. But as for an actual hardware fix, well thats a different story. The WiFi-enabled version of the Pico 2 was released just last month, and its still susceptible to the same bug. Given that the hardware workaround for the issue  adding external pull-downs  isnt expensive or complicated to implement, and that most users probably wouldnt run into the problem in the first place, it seems like theres no rush to produce a new version of the silicon.\nVoyager 1 Shows its Age\nAdmittedly, any piece of hardware thats been flying through deep space for nearly 50 years is bound to run into some problems, especially one that was built with 1970s era technology. But even still, 2024 was a rough year for humanitys most distant explorer, Voyager 1.\nThe far-flung probe was already in trouble when the year started, as it was still transmitting gibberish due to being hit with a flipped-bit error in December of 2023. Things looked pretty grim for awhile, but by mid-March engineers had started making progress on the issue, and normal communication was restored before the end of April.\nIn celebration Dan Maloney took a deep-dive into the computers of Voyager, a task made surprisingly difficult by the fact that some of the key documentation he was after apparently never got never digitized. Things were still going well by June, and in September ground controllers were able to pull off a tricky reconfiguration of the spacecrafts thrusters.\n\nBut just a month later, Voyager suffered another major glitch. After receiving a command to turn on one of its heaters, Voyager went into a fault protection mode that hadnt been triggered since 1981. In this mode only the spacecrafts low power S-band radio was operational, and there was initially concern that NASA wouldnt be able to detect the signal. Luckily they were able to pick out Voyagers faint cries for help, and on November 26th, the space agency announced they had established communications with the probe and returned it to normal operations.\nWhile Voyager 1 ended 2024 on a high note, theres no beating the clock. Even if nothing else goes wrong with the aging hardware, the spacecrafts plutonium power source is producing less and less energy each year. Various systems can be switched off to save power, something NASA elected to do with Voyager 2 back in October, but eventually even that wont be enough and the storied spacecraft will go silent for good.\nCH32 Gains Momentum\nWe first got word of the CH32 family of low-cost RISC-V microcontrollers back in early 2023, but they were hard to come by and the available documentation and software toolchains left something to be desired. A 10\u00a2 MCU sounds great, but what good is it if you cant buy the thing or program it?\nThe situation was very different in 2024. We ran nearly three times the number of posts featuring some variant of the CH32 in 2024 than we did in the previous year, and something tells us the numbers for 2025 will be through the roof. The fact that the chips got official support in the Arduino IDE back in January certainly helped increase its popularity with hobbyists, and by March you could boot Linux on the thing, assuming you had time to spare.\nIn May bitluni had clustered 256 of them together, another hacker had gotten speech recognition running on it, and there was even a project that aimed to turn the SOIC-8 variant of the chip into the worlds cheapest RISC-V computer.\nWe even put our own official stamp of approval on the CH32 by giving each and every attendee of Supercon 2024 one to experiment with. Not only did attendees get a Simple-Add On (SAO) protoboard with an onboard CH32, but the badge itself doubled as a programmer for the chip, thanks in no small part to help from [CNLohr].\nEvolution of the SAO\nBut the CH32 isnt the only thing that got a boost during Supercon 2024. After years of seeing SAOs that were little more than a handful of (admittedly artistically arranged) LEDs, we challenged hackers to come up with functional badge add-ons using the six-pin interface and show them off in Pasadena by way of an event badge that served as a power and communications hub for them.\nThe response was phenomenal. Compared to the more complex interfaces used in previous Supercon badges, focusing on the SAO standard greatly reduced the barrier of entry for those who wanted to produce their own modular add-ons in time for the November event. Instead of only a handful of ambitious attendees having the time and experience necessary to produce a modular PCB compatible with the badge, a good chunk of the ticket holders were able bring along SAOs to show off and trade, adding a whole new dimension to the event.\nWhile its unlikely well ever make another Supercon badge thats quite as SAO-centric as we did in 2024, we hope that the experience of designing, building, and sharing these small add-ons will inspire them to keep the momentum going in 2025 and beyond.\nShare Your 2024 Memories\nEven if this post was four times as long, theres no way wed be able to hit on everyones favorite story or event from 2024.

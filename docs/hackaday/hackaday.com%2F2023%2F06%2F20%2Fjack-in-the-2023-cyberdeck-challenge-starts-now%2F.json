Combine that with the ubiquitous smartphone, and its safe to say that the state of mobile computing has never been better.\nDespite this, over the last several years weve watched cyberdecks go from a few one-off examples to a vibrant community of truly personal computing devices. While there are some exceptions, most of them are larger, more expensive, and less portable than whats available on the commercial market. But thats not the point  a cyberdeck should be a reflection of the hacker that built it, not the product of a faceless megacorp.\nWhich is why were excited to officially announce the 2023 Cyberdeck Challenge, starting now and running all summer through to August 15th.\nWhether its a ridiculously over the top wearable that wouldnt look out of place in a cyberpunk anime or a pocket-sized gadget that you operate with a handful of unlabeled buttons, we want to see it. All we ask is that it be a functional device capable of some useful amount of computing, anything beyond that is up to you. Turn in one of the top three designs, and youll earn a $150 USD DigiKey shopping spree, just what you need to pack a few extra bells and whistles into your rig.\n\nConqueror the Sprawl\nBeyond the top three winners, well also be looking for builds which best exemplify the following special categories:\n\nIcebreaker: While there\u2019s nothing wrong with building a deck for the aesthetic, we\u2019re especially interested in practical builds. Does your deck have some special capabilities that make it stand out from your average laptop?\nROM Construct: Some of the most impressive decks are the ones that have been customized to the point that they can only realistically be used by their creators. If the average person wouldn\u2019t even know how to turn your deck on, this might be the category for you.\nDex Dealer: Safely powering a portable cyberdeck can be a challenge, especially as their computational capabilities increase. Decks considered for this category will feature either unique or particularly well implemented power sources, allowing their jockeys to connect to the net wherever they are.\nTuring Police: Artificial intelligence is here to stay, so you might as well make the best of it. This category is for decks that utilize some form of AI, or perhaps were even designed or built with the assistance of an AI.\n\nA Consensual Hallucination\nNeed some inspiration? We might be a bit shy of the billions of legitimate operators that William Gibson imagined in Neuromancer, but theres certainly no shortage of cyberdecks here on Hackaday. While the idea is not to replicate another hackers design exactly, browsing through the incredible entries we saw in last years cyberdeck contest should get you on the right track.\n \n\n", "title": "2023 Cyberdeck Challenge\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "2023 Cyberdeck Challenge\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3042\u306a\u305f\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u304c\u3069\u3093\u306a\u5f62\u3067\u3082\u69cb\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u552f\u4e00\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\uff13\u306b\u9078\u3070\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306f\u3001$150 USD\u306eDigiKey\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u7279\u5225\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3084AI\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306a\u3069\u304c\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3088\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["2023 Cyberdeck Challenge\u3092\u767a\u8868", "Hacker\u306e\u500b\u6027\u3092\u6620\u3059\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b", "\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u7af6\u6280", "\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5f77\u5f7f\u3068\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5f97\u308b", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u898b\u305f\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5f97\u308b"]}

As the shaft turns, so does the attached indicator.\nSmall movements of the motor are therefore turned into larger movements of something else. So far, so simple. But what about visualizing very small extrusions, such as those tiny ones made during ironing?\n[Jack]s solution is a Vernier indicator for the extruder. Even the smallest movements of the extruder motors shaft are made clearly visible by such a device, as shown in the header image above. Vernier scales are more commonly found on measurement tools, and the concept is somewhat loosely borrowed here.\nThe usual way these lightweight indicators are attached is with a small magnet, and you can read all about them and see examples here.\nThis new design is basically the same, it simply has a background in a contrasting color added into the mix. [Jack]s design is intended for the Bambu A1 printer, but the idea can be easily adapted. Give it a look if you find yourself yearning for a bit more visibility in your extruder movements."}

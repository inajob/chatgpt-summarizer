Maybe you dont want a job turning a wrench or pushing a broom, but someone does. But then there are the jobs no one wants to do or physically cant do. Robots fighting fires, disarming bombs, or cleaning up nuclear reactors is something most people will support. But can you climb through a water pipe from the inside? No? There are robots that\u00a0are available from several commercial companies and others from university researchers from multiple continents.\nIf you think about it, it makes sense. For years, companies that deal with pipes would shoot large slugs, or pigs, through the pipeline to scrape them clean. Eventually, they festooned some pigs with sensors, and thus was born the smart pig. But now that it is possible to make tiny robots, why not send them inside the pipe to inspect and repair?\n\nWhy?\nIt makes sense that anything you can do from inside the pipe is probably going to be cheaper than digging up buried pipe and either repairing or replacing it. For example, 4 cm robots from the University of Sheffield can inspect pipes from inside, cooperate in swarms, and locate leaks that would be nearly impossible to find conventionally.\nIn fact, robots inside pipes arent a totally new idea. But in the past, the pipes had to be very large to fit the robot. This newer class of pipe inspecting and repairing robots can fit inside smaller pipes like you might find in a citys water supply. For example, the Easy-Sight X5 (see the video below) fits in a 100 mm pipe, and it is big when compared to some of the newer competitors.\n\nNot Just Inspection\nThe Carnegie Mellon robot is modular, so it can handle different kinds of jobs. A mobility module has two-inch wheels and can haul up to sixty pounds of payload. One of those payloads is an applicator for a special resin that can repair leaks.\nThe resin starts out with the consistency of soft-serve ice cream but quickly hardens as it shoots out of a spinning nozzle that creates a spring-like inner coating spiraling around the inside of the pipe.\nThe robots no speed demon. It can inspect about nine miles of pipe in eight hours. However, when repairing, the same time period is sufficient to fix 1.8 miles of pipe. Even big names like GE are working on similar technology that will spray epoxy to form a new pipe inside an old pipe.\n\nDIY\nCould you do this yourself? Theres no reason you couldnt make an inspection robot. [Stargate Systems] did using a Raspberry Pi Zero, and you can check it out in the video below. Repair might be a bit more complex, but might be workable with a little ingenuity.\n\nDirty Jobs\nEven if you and your submarine were shrunk down, you probably dont want this job. There are probably dozens of jobs you cant or dont want to do. Will you build a robot to do it? Let us know in the comments or  better  built it and leave us a tip.\nWe wonder why these robots dont look more like snakes."}

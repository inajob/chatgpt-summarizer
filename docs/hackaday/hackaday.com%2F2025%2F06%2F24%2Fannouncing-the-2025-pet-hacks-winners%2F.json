(Well, anyway, that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to us.) For the 2025 Pet Hacks Challenge, we asked you to share your favorite pet-related hacks, and you all delivered. So without further ado, here are our favorites, as well as the picks-of-the-litter that qualified for three $150 DigiKey gift certificates. Spoiler alert: it was a clean sweep for team cat.\n\nThe Top Three\n[Andrea Favero]\u2019s CAT AT THE DOOR project (his caps, not ours) packs more tech than strictly necessary, and our judges loved it. When the cat approaches, a radar detects it, a BLE collar identifies the particular cat, and a LoRA radio notifies the human on a beautiful e-ink display with a sufficiently loud beeper. Your job, then, is to open the door. This project has standout build instructions, and even if you\u2019re a dog person, you\u2019ll want to read them if you\u2019re using any of these technologies in a build of your own.\nFoxy and Layla are two cats on two different diets. One has prescription food that unfortunately isn\u2019t as tasty as the regular stuff, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can just mompf up the other cat\u2019s chow. The solution? Computer vision! [Joe Mattioni]\u2019s Cat Bowl Monitor hacks a commercial cat feeder to operate via an Android app running on an old cell phone. [Joe] trained the image recognition algorithm specifically on his two cats, which helps reliability greatly. Like the previous winner, the documentation is great, and it\u2019s a sweet application of real-time image classification and a nice reuse of an oldish cellphone. Kudos!\nAnd finally, [rkramer]\u2019s Cat Valve is a one-way cat airlock. Since \u201cBad Kitty\u201d likes to go out hunting at night, and [rkramer] doesn\u2019t like having live trophies continually brought back into the house, a sliding door lets the cat out, but then closes behind. A webcam and a Raspberry Pi lets the human decide if the cat gets to come back in or not, relying on HI (Human Intelligence) for the image processing. This isn\u2019t inhumane: the cat isn\u2019t stuck outside, but merely in the cellar. No mention of how [rkramer] gets the traumatized rats out of his cellar, but we imagine there\u2019ll be a hack for that as well.\nCongrats to you three! We\u2019ll be getting in touch with you soon to get your $150 DigiKey spending spree.\nHonorable Mentions\nThe \u201cPet Safety\u201d honorable mention category was created to honor those hacks that help promote pet health and safety. Nothing fit that bill as well as [donutsorelse]\u2019s Chicken Guardian, which uses computer vision to detect various predators and scare them away with a loud voice recording. (We\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s entertaining or effective.) [Saren Tasciyan]\u2019s Dog bed is also a dog scale that does just what it says, and we imagine that it\u2019s a huge quality of life improvement for both the Bernese and her owners. And finally, [methodicalmaker_]\u2019s IoT Cat Treat Dispenser + Treadmill for Weight Loss is a paradox: rewarding a cat with food for getting on a treadmill to lose weight. Time will tell if the dosages can be calibrated just right.\nIn the \u201cHome Alone\u201d category, we wanted to see remote pet-care ideas. Of course, there was a vacation fish feeder, in the form of [Coders Cafe]\u2019s Aquassist, which we really liked for the phone app \u2013 it\u2019s a simple build that looks great. Further from the beaten path, [kasik]\u2019s TinyML meets dog training is a cool experiment in machine learning that also feeds and distracts the dog from barking at the door, even when [kasik] is out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPlayful Pets\u201d was for the goofy, fun, pet hacks, and the hamsters have won it. [Giulio Pons] brought us Ruby\u2019s Connected Hamster Wheel, which tracked his hamster\u2019s mileage on the wheel at night for two years running, and [Roni Bandini]\u2019s Wall Street hamster project lets Milstein buy and sell stonks. Hilarious, and hopefully not too financially painful.\nAnd finally, the \u201cCyborg Pets\u201d category just has to go to Fyt\u00f3, which basically gamifies taking care of a plant. There was intense debate about whether a plant could be a pet, but what\u2019s more cyborg than a living Tamagotchi?\nThanks!\nThanks to everyone who entered! It was awesome to see your efforts on behalf of our animal friends. And if you didn\u2019t get to enter because you just don\u2019t have a pet, check back in with us on Thursday, when our next challenge begins.", "title": "- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u96c6\uff1a2025\u5e74\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "body": "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u30b3\u30f3\u30da\u3067\u3001\u732b\u95a2\u9023\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3002\u53d7\u8cde\u4f5c\u306f\u6280\u8853\u7684\u306b\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u96c6\uff1a2025\u5e74\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "- \u732b\u5411\u3051\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u6700\u524d\u7dda\uff1a\u30c9\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u98df\u4e8b\u76e3\u8996\u307e\u3067", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u732b\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406", "- \u9762\u767d\u3044\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eConnected Hamster Wheel", "- \u8ce2\u3044\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30b1\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\uff1a\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30a4\u30ce\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

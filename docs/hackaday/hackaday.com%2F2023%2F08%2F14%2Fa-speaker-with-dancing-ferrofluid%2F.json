The housing is 3D printed and includes some translucent portions for LEDs.You can see and hear the speaker at work in the video below.\nApparently, not all ferrofluid is created equal. You can get just the fluid, but then you have to work up some sort of carrier fluid. You can also get the material already in a glass with a carrier fluid, which is a better option. Apparently, you can also get cheap material that is little more than iron filings suspended in a liquid. Thats not really ferrofluid.\n\nThe rest of the build is what youd expect: some speakers and a simple amplifier. The magnetic portion uses a 24V electromagnet. A few MOSFETs and some discrete components make a simple driver for the magnet. We wondered if it would be possible to use multiple magnets that would drive at different frequencies to make a kind of spectrum display using the ferrofluid.\nThe holes for the brass threaded inserts were accidentally too big, so he epoxyed them in. We dont want to reveal if weve ever done that, but we know it works fine in a pinch.\nThis reminded us of a drum machine we once saw. If you have old VHS tapes, you might try making your own fluid.\n", "title": "\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u3001\u821e\u3044\u8e0a\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u5165\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u82b8\u8853\u4f5c\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u7279\u7570\u3067\u3059\u3002\u97f3\u8cea\u3088\u308a\u3082\u305d\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u6750\u6599\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u3068\u9055\u3044", "DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff01\u53e4\u3044VHS\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c9\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

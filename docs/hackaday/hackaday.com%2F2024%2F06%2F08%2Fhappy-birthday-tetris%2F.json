But if you are just getting started, or want to focus more on the physical build of your project, a simpler game is probably the way to go. Maybe this explains the eternal popularity of games like PONG, Tetris, Snake, or even Pac-Man. The amount of fun you can have playing the game, relative to the size of the code necessary to implement them, make these games evergreen.\nYesterday was Tetris\u2019 40th birthday, and in honor of the occasion, I thought I\u2019d bring you a collection of sweet Tetris hacks.\nOn the big-builds side of things, it\u2019s hard to beat these MIT students who used colored lights in the windows of the Green Building back in 2012. They apparently couldn\u2019t get into some rooms, because they had some dead pixels, but at that scale, who\u2019s complaining? Coming in just smaller, at the size of a whole wall, [Oat Foundry]\u2019s giant split-flap display Tetris\u00a0is certainly noisy enough.\nSmaller still, although only a little bit less noisy, this flip-dot Tetris is at home on the coffee table, while this one by [Electronoobs] gives you an excuse to play around with RGB LEDs. And if you need a Tetris for your workbench, but you don\u2019t have the space for an extra screen, this oscilloscope version is just the ticket. Or just play it (sideways) on your business card.\nAll of the above projects have focused on the builds, but if you want to tackle your own, you\u2019ll need to spend some time with the code as well. We\u2019ve got you covered. Way back, former Editor in Chief [Mike Szczys] ported Tetris to the AVR platform. If you need color, this deep dive into the way the NES version of Tetris worked also comes with demo code in Java and Lua. TetrOS is the most minimal version of the game we\u2019ve seen, coming in at a mere 446 bytes, but it\u2019s without any of the frills.\nNo Tetris birthday roundup would be complete without mentioning the phenomenal \u201cFrom NAND to Tetris\u201d course, which really does what it says on the package: builds a Tetris game, and your understanding of computing in general, from the ground up.\nCan you think of other projects to celebrate Tetris\u2019 40th?

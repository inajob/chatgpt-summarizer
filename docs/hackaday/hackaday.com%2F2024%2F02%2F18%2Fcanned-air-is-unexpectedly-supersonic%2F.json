Perhaps faster than one might think! Its supersonic (video, embedded below) as [Cylos Garage] shows by imaging clear shock diamonds in the flow from those thin little tubes.\nShock diamonds are a clear indicator of supersonic flow.\nShock diamonds, normally seen in things like afterburning jet turbine or rocket engine exhaust streams, are the product of standing wave patterns that indicate supersonic speeds. These are more easily visible in jet plumes, but [Cylos Garage] managed to get some great images of the same phenomenon in more everyday things such as the flow of duster gas.\nImaging this is made possible thanks to what looks like a simple but effective Schlieren imaging setup, which is a method of visualizing normally imperceptible changes in a fluids refractive index. Since the refractive index of a gas can change in response to density, pressure, or temperature, its a perfect way to see whats going on when theres otherwise nothing for ones eyeballs to latch onto.\nIntrigued by this kind of imaging? It requires a careful setup, but nothing particularly complicated or hard to get a hold of. Heres one such setup, heres a Schlieren videography project, and heres a particularly intriguing approach that leverages modern electronics like a smartphone.\nThanks to [Quinor] for the tip!\n\n"}

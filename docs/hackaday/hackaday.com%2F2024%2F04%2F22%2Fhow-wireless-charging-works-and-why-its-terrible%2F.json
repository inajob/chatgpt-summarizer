Just put the device you want to charge on the wireless charger without worrying about plugging in a cable. Yet as it turns out, the disadvantages of wireless charging may be more severe than you think, at least according to tests by iFixIts [Shahram Mokhtari] and colleagues. In the article the basics of wireless charging are covered, as well as why wireless charging wastes a lot more power even when not charging, and why it may damage your devices battery faster than wired charging.\nThe inefficiency comes mostly from the extra steps needed to create the alternating current (AC) with wireless coupling between the coils, and the conversion back to DC. Yet it is compounded by the issue of misaligned coils, which further introduce inefficiencies. Though various protocols seek to fix this (Qi2 and Apples MagSafe) using alignment magnets, these manage to lose 59% of the power drawn from the mains due to these inefficiencies. Wireless chargers also are forced to stay active, polling for a new device to charge, which keeps a MagSafe charger sucking up 0.2 W in standby.\n\nIf the losses from wired charging for a year come down to leaving a 10 W LED lamp on for eight hours total, wireless charging with MagSafe or Qi2 has you leaving that lamp on for 24 days straight. Since your phone is not a lamp, this means that much of this wasted power is dissipated as heat, both on the transmitting and receiving end. With the wireless receiving coil being placed practically on top of the battery in smartphones, this means that you are bumping the battery temperature up by about 8\u00b0C in the best scenario (fully aligned MagSafe/Qi2) over wired charging, and a sustained 40+\u00b0C in the case of a misaligned Qi charger, or the worst of all: the Tesla Charging Platform with its many overlapping coils.\nThus if plugging in a cable to connect a device is that much of a hassle, be sure to at the very least get a wireless charging solution that doesnt simultaneously bump up your power bill and shorten the lifespan of the devices battery.\n", "title": "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u6b20\u70b9 - iFixit\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8003\u5bdf", "body": "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306f\u4fbf\u5229\u3060\u304c\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u6027\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u7121\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u306f\u914d\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u3088\u308a\u3082\u591a\u304f\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u7121\u99c4\u306b\u3057\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u3092\u77ed\u304f\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u6e29\u5ea6\u306b\u3082\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306a\u52b9\u7387\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u6b20\u70b9 - iFixit\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8003\u5bdf", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u52a3\u5316\u306e\u554f\u984c", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u7121\u99c4\u306a\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u71b1\u306e\u554f\u984c", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u52b9\u7387\u306e\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3068\u71b1\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u6709\u7dda\u5145\u96fb\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5bff\u547d\u306e\u89b3\u70b9"]}

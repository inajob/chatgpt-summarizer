Using the hours and hours of dolphin sounds recorded by researchers over the decades, the hope is that the LLM will allow us to communicate more effectively with the second most intelligent species on the planet.\nThe LLM is designed to run in the field on Google Pixel phones, due to it being based on Googles in-house Gemini product, which is a bit less cumbersome than hauling a mainframe on a dive. The Wild Dolphin Project currently uses the Georgia Tech developed CHAT (Cetacean Hearing Augmentation Telemetry) device which has a Pixel 6 at its heart, but the newer system will be bumped up to a Pixel 9 to take advantage of all those shiny new AI processing advances. Hopefully, well have a better chance of catching when they say, So long and thanks for all the fish.\nIf youre curious about other mysterious languages being deciphered by LLMs, we have you covered.\n\n"}

Unfortunately, the original models had a glaring problem: their unlit LCD screens could be very difficult to see. For that reason, console modders who work on these systems tend to improve the screen first like this project which brings a few other upgrades as well.\nThe fully open-source modification is called the Open AGB Display and brings an IPS display to the classic console. The new screen has 480480 resolution which is slightly larger than the original resolution but handles upscaling with no noticeable artifacts and even supports adding some back in like scanlines and pixelation to keep the early 00s aesthetic. The build does require permanently modifying the case though, but for the original GBA we dont see much downside. [Tobi] also goes through a ton of detail on how the mod works as well, for those who want to take a deep dive into the background theory.\nThere has been a lot of activity in the Game Boy Advance communities lately though as the hardware and software become more understood. If you dont want to modify original hardware, want an upgraded experience, but still want to use the original game cartridges we might recommend something like the Game Bub instead.", "title": "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u753b\u9762\u3092\u6539\u826f\uff01Open AGB Display\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u6db2\u6676\u753b\u9762\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u753b\u9762\u3092\u6539\u826f\uff01Open AGB Display\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "GBA\u306e\u30ea\u30da\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aIPS\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3078\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u7f8e\u5b66\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff01GBA\u7528\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\uff1aGBA\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

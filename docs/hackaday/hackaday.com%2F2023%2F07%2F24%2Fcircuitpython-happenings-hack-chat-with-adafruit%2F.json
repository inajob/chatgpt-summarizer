Its hard to predict where the conversation will go when [LadyAda], [pt], and [Scott] roll in, but we strongly suspect itll center on whats new in the world of CircuitPython.\nWeve heard that theyve got some cool stuff going on with CircuitPython on the RP2040, which just might lead to a Python-based fix for the current Bus Pirate supply chain problem. Itll be a swashbucklingly good time, so make sure you stop by.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, July 26 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have ahandy time zone converter."}

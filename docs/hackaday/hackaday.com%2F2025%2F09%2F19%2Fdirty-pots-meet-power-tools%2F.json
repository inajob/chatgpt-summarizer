You cant exactly break out the grinder to clean off the remains of last nights dinner right? Well, maybe not a grinder, but thanks to this hack by [Markus Opitz], you can use an oscillating tool.\nIts a simple enough hack: [Markus] modeled the attachment for his Bosch oscillating tool in Tinkercad, and created a bracket to hold a large metal binder clip. The clip attaches with a screw, and can hold whatever scrubbing pad your carpel-tunnel afflicted hands cant bear to hold on to. Hes using a self-cleaning stainless-steel sponge.\nOne nice touch is a pair of protective lips on the jaws of the metal clip, to keep it from accidentally scratching the delicate surface under care. Of course if you have a drill or a Dremel handy you can buy attachments for polishing disks of various grits, but whats the fun in that? Doing the dishes with a hacked-together oscillating tool just somehow seems more fun. Plus this way you cant accidentally produce an engine-turning pattern.\nWe dont seem to have featured many hacks for these fun, buzzing, multi-purpose tools, so if youve got one send us a tip. We did feature an oscillating cutter for CNC once, but that was fully DIY."}

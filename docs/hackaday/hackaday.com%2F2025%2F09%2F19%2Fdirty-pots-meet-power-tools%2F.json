You cant exactly break out the grinder to clean off the remains of last nights dinner right? Well, maybe not a grinder, but thanks to this hack by [Markus Opitz], you can use an oscillating tool.\nIts a simple enough hack: [Markus] modeled the attachment for his Bosch oscillating tool in Tinkercad, and created a bracket to hold a large metal binder clip. The clip attaches with a screw, and can hold whatever scrubbing pad your carpel-tunnel afflicted hands cant bear to hold on to. Hes using a self-cleaning stainless-steel sponge.\nOne nice touch is a pair of protective lips on the jaws of the metal clip, to keep it from accidentally scratching the delicate surface under care. Of course if you have a drill or a Dremel handy you can buy attachments for polishing disks of various grits, but whats the fun in that? Doing the dishes with a hacked-together oscillating tool just somehow seems more fun. Plus this way you cant accidentally produce an engine-turning pattern.\nWe dont seem to have featured many hacks for these fun, buzzing, multi-purpose tools, so if youve got one send us a tip. We did feature an oscillating cutter for CNC once, but that was fully DIY.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6383\u9664\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "body": "\u6383\u9664\u304c\u5acc\u3044\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u6717\u5831\uff01\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u697d\u3057\u304f\u6383\u9664\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6383\u9664\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u6383\u9664\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u76bf\u6d17\u3044\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "- \u7e4a\u7d30\u306a\u8868\u9762\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- \u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080DIY\u6383\u9664\u8853"]}

Some laptop projects definitely veer towards being cyberdecks while others take a more conventional path, but weve rarely seen one as professional looking as [Byran Huang]s anyon_e open source laptop. It really takes the art to the next level.\nThe quality is immediately apparent in the custom CNC-machined anodised aluminium case, and upon opening it up the curious user could be forgiven for thinking they had a stylish commercial machine in their hands. Theres a slimline mechanical keyboard and a glass trackpad, and that display is an OLED. In fact the whole thing had been built from scratch, and inside is an RK3588 SoC on a module sitting on a custom-designed motherboard. It required some effort for it to drive the display, a process weve seen cause pain to other designers, but otherwise it runs Debian. The batteries are slimline pouch cells, with a custom controller board driven by an ESP32.\nThis must have cost quite a bit to build, but its something anyone can have a go at for themselves as everything is in a GitHub repository. Purists might ask for open source silicon at its heart to make it truly open source, but considering what hes done well take this. Its not the first high quality laptop project weve seen by any means, but it may be the first that wouldnt raise any eyebrows in the boardroom. Take a look at the video below the break.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.byran.ee/posts/creation/"}

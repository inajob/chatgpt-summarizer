This weekend it was a trip to Maker Faire Delft, thanks to the wonders of the European Interail scheme. Once on the site, [Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131n Aksan]s 4-shaft weaving loom immediately caught our eye. This is an open-source portable folding loom design. In weaving terms, shafts are sliding vertical frames. As the name implies, this loom has four, which allow different sets of warp threads to be brought to the surface of the weave at different times. This feature makes it capable of weaving complex patterns in the fabric and thus makes it a very interesting project indeed.\nThe frame of the loom is laser-cut ply, cunningly designed such that when not in use it can be folded into a compact unit. The attachments are all 3D-printed PLA in the prototypes, the comb is laser-cut acrylic, and the heddles are 3D printed in a flexible material. These last components conceal a further trick, theyre designed to be extra-easy to move between shafts on the fly, allowing even more complex patterns to be created.\nAll in all this is one of those special projects that comes out of the blue and raises the bar on all in its class. If theres another 4-shaft loom this accessible, weve yet to hear of it.\nIts not the first loom weve covered, however, this one wasnt nearly as accomplished."}

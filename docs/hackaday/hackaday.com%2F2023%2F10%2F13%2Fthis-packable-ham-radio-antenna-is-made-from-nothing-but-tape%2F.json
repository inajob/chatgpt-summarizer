Usually, though, hams will build their J-poles from rigid materials, copper water pipe being a typical choice. Copper has the advantage of being easily sourced, and also results in a self-supporting, weather-resistant antenna thats easy to mount outdoors. However, copper is getting to be egregiously expensive, and a couple of meters of water pipe isnt exactly amenable to portable operation, if thats your jam.\nTo solve those problems, [Ben] decided to keep his copper use to a minimum with a roll of copper foil tape. He doesnt provide any specs on the tape, but it looks like its about 6 mm (1/4) wide and judging by a quick Amazon search, probably goes for about $10 a roll. He starts the build with a couple of strips of plain old duck tape  weve already had the duck vs. duct argument  laid out with the sticky sides together. The copper foil is applied to the duck tape backing using dimensions from any of the J-pole calculators available online. Dimensions are critical to getting good performance from a J-pole, and this is where [Ben]s tape design shines. Element too long? No problem, just peel up a bit and tear some off. Did you go too far and make an element too short? Easy  just stick on an extension piece of foil. Tuning the location of the feedline connection was a snap, too, with movable terminals held in place with magnets.\nOnce everything was tuned up, [Ben] soldered down the feed points and covered the foil with a protective layer of duck tape. The antenna performed swimmingly, and aside from costing almost nothing to build, it weighs very little, rolls up to fit in a pack for field operations, and can easily be hoisted into a tree for better coverage. Looks like well be putting in an order for some copper tape and building one of these too.\n", "title": "\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3060\u3051\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u304b\uff1f\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u7d50\u679c", "body": "\u300cWill It Antenna?\u300d\u306e\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3060\u3051\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3001\u304b\u306a\u308a\u826f\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3082\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u3001\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u3082\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u6a39\u6728\u306b\u540a\u308a\u4e0b\u3052\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3060\u3051\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u304b\uff1f\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u7d50\u679c", "\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u4ee3\u7528\u306b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u958b\u767a\uff01\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u306f", "6mm\u306e\u9285\u7b94\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u9285\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8efd\u91cf\u6027\u3068\u30b3\u30b9\u30d1\u306e\u826f\u3055\u306f\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u3082\u306e"]}

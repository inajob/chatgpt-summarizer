Making the knob is another thing  that takes a shop full of machine tools, the expertise to use them, and a whole bunch of time. Then again, if youre pressed for time, it looks like a 3D printer will do nicely too.\nWhile the 3D printing route is clearly the easier option, it sure seems as if [Chronova Engineering] is more about the journey than the destination. In need of some knob bling for an electric guitar, he takes us through the lengthy process (nicely summarized in the video below) of crafting one from a bar of solid brass. Like all good machining projects, this one starts with making the tools necessary to start the actual build; in this case, its a tool to cut the splines needing to mate with the splines on the guitars potentiometer shaft. That side quest alone represents probably a third of the total effort on this project, and results in a tool thats used for all of about 30 seconds.\nAside from spline cutting, there are a ton of interesting machining tidbits on display here. We particularly liked the use of a shaping technique to form the knurling on the knob, as opposed to a standard rotary method, which would have been difficult given the taper on the knob body. Also worth noting are the grinding step that puts a visually interesting pattern on the knobs top surface, as well as the pantograph used to etch the knobs markings.\nCongrats to [Chronova Engineering] for a great-looking build, and the deep dive into the machinists ways. If youre still interested in custom brass knobs but dont have a machine shop, we can help with that.\n\n"}

We managed to catch the first one back in 2017, and still have plans for the next one in April of 2024. But we gave this one a miss, mainly because it was just an annular eclipse, promising a less spectacular presentation than a total eclipse.\nLooks like we were wrong about that, at least judging by photographs of last weeks Ring of Fire eclipse. NASA managed to catch a shot of the Moons shadow over the middle of the US from the Deep Space Climate Observer at Lagrange Point 1. The image, which shows both the compact central umbra of the shadow and the much larger penumbra, which covers almost the entire continent, is equal parts fascinating and terrifying. Ground-based photographers were very much in the action too, turning in some lovely shots of the eclipse. We particularly like this one-in-a-million shot of a jet airliner photobombing the developing eclipse. Shots like these make us feel like it was a mistake to skip the 10-hour drive to the path of annularity.\n\n\nTo err is human, but to really foul things up takes a computer, or so the somewhat Luddite saying goes. Perhaps the saying would be more accurate if programmer were appended to it after a Georgia man found himself slapped with a $1.4 million speeding ticket. Granted, he was doing 90 mph in a 55 mph zone, which could have earned him a reckless driving charge, but even then, the maximum fine for that charge under Georgia law is limited to $1,000.\nA phone call to the court confirmed that he had to pay the seven-figure charge or show up in court, which of course he did. Thats where he learned that the strangely specific $1,480,038.52 charge was just a placeholder in the courts e-citation software, reserved for those doing more than 35 miles per hour over the posted limit and apparently meant to scare the hell out of them. From a coders perspective, this seems like a weird number to choose for a placeholder. Wed expect to see a power of two; 220 is close to the value they used, but not quite. Either way, perhaps the speeders best strategy here would have been to change his name to DROP TABLE Violators; or something like that.\nEver wonder what happens to spacecraft when they return to Earth? If youre lucky, they end up in the drink at the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility; if youre not so lucky, something from space might end up on a beach somewhere. But along the way, a good part of the mass ends up as air pollution, or more specifically, as metal alloy aerosols spread throughout the stratosphere. Perdue Univerisity researchers used NASAs WB-57 High-Altitude Science platform to fly through the stratosphere above Alaska and sample the rarified air, finding more than 20 elements up there, including aluminum, copper, lithium, and lead. The mass of the metals found exceeds what would normally be found in cosmic dust, and the ratios of metals look very much like those youd expect to find on spacecraft.\nCare for a blast from the past? Then be sure to check out the Version Museum, an online collection of the way things used to look back when the Internet was young. Remember when Amazon sold nothing but books? Or when YouTube used to let you Broadcast Yourself? Theyve got operating systems and applications, too  Windows all the way back to Version 1.01, the Happy Mac screen, and Excel when it was text-based and called Multiplan. Sorry, though  they dont have any history on Hackaday; perhaps theyll take submissions.\nAnd finally, if youve ever said to yourself, Self, you just dont know enough about foams, youre in luck  New Mind just released a video called The Science of Foam. And if you think theres no way that a 23-minute video about foam could be interesting, think again. It covers all kinds of dispersed media materials, everything from the head on a mug of beer to synthetic polymeric foams used for insulation and packaging. If youre at all into industrial chemistry and processes, its a fascinating video.\n\n\n"}

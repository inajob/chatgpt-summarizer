How are you going to generate G-Code for this 4th axis? Thats the great part, and the hack, that [legolor] really just swapped the Y axis for the rotation. To finish the workflow and keep things cheap accessible to all theres a great trick to unwrap your 3D model so your CAM software of choice thinks its still using a linear Y axis and keeps your existing workflow largely intact. While this requires an extra step in Blender to do the unwrapping, we love the way this hack changes as little of the rest of your process as possible. The Blender script might be useful for many other purposes too.\n\nThe results speak for themselves too! We thought the 3D printed parts were suspect in a CNC setup, but for the small scale of game pieces and milling wood, the setup is stable enough to produce a surprisingly accurate and detailed finish. If you want to try the same approach with something larger or a tougher material, [legolor] has a suggestion of a tailstock setup thats still under $100 USD.\n", "title": "3D\u30df\u30eb\u306b\u56de\u8ee2\u8ef8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "[legolor]\u304c3\u8ef8CNC\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u76e4\u306b\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9803\u306a\u56de\u8ee2\u8ef8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002[legolor]\u306fY\u8ef8\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u8ef8\u306b\u5909\u3048\u3001\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5c55\u958b\u3059\u308bBlender\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067G\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u751f\u6210\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u3082\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306f\u9ad8\u3044\u3002\u5927\u7269\u3084\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u6750\u6599\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5c02\u7528\u306etailstock setup\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u3082\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30df\u30eb\u306b\u56de\u8ee2\u8ef8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "G\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u300c\u89e3\u304f\u300d\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af", "Blender\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

Its the kind of thing that takes zen-like patience to assemble, and years to master and who has time for that? [Paper View] likes the style of kumiko, but when all you have is a 3D printer, everything is extruded plastic. \nHis video, embedded below, focuses mostly on the large tiled piece and the clever design required to avoid more than the unavoidable unsightly seems without excessive post processing. (Who has time for that?) The key is a series of top pieces to hide the edges where the seams come together. The link above, however, gives something more interesting, even if it is on Makerworld.\n[Paper View] has created a kumiko-style (out of respect for the craftspeople who make the real thing, we wont call this kumiko) panel generator, that allows one to create custom-sized frames to print either in one piece, or to assemble as in the video. We havent looked at MakerWorlds Parametric Model Maker before, but this tool seems to make full use of its capabilities (to the point of occasionally timing out). It looks like this is a wrapper for OpenScad (just like Thingiverse used to do with Customizer) so there might be a chance if enough of us comment on the video [Paper View] can be convinced to release the scad files on a more open platform.\nWeve featured kumiko before, like this wood-epoxy guitar,\u00a0 but for ultimate irony points, you need to see this metal kumiko pattern made out of nails. (True kumiko cannot use nails, you see.)\nThanks to [Hari Wiguna] for the tip, and please keep them coming!\n\n", "title": "- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u98a8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "body": "\u30af\u30df\u30b3\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6728\u5de5\u6280\u8853\u3067\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u6728\u7247\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u82b8\u8853\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u751f\u6210\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u98a8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "- \u300c\u624b\u9593\u3044\u3089\u305a\u306e\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\uff1a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u300d", "- \u300c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u98a8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "- \u300c\u91d1\u5c5e\u88fd\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\uff1a\u771f\u306e\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u306e\u9006\u8aac\u300d", "- \u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85\uff1a\u30ab\u30df\u30b3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u300d"]}

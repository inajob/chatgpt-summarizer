Because of this, subwoofers are common in high-quality audio setups, often costing a substantial part of the budget. [Daniel Fajkis] takes the subwoofer to its logical extreme by building a rotary subwoofer on a $200 budget.\nThe principle of a rotary subwoofer is that a normal subwoofer physically moves the air, and so does a fan. If you could make a fan oscillate the air instead of only pushing it, you could turn it into such a subwoofer, which is exactly what [Daniel] did. [Daniel] mounts a large electric motor on the case of an ex-subwoofer to spin the fan. Then, he uses the rotor linkage of a model helicopter and a modified subwoofer speaker to pitch the fan blades, spinning around to create a truly impressive gust of air oscillating at as low as 1 Hz.\nThe video, after the break, is well made with some good humor, including the legendary quote: Its gonna tear apart my household, theres no way were surviving this one.\n\n\nIf that isnt enough force from a subwoofer for you, maybe this subwoofer vortex cannon is."}

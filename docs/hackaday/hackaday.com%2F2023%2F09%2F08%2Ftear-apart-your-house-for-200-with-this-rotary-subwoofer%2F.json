Because of this, subwoofers are common in high-quality audio setups, often costing a substantial part of the budget. [Daniel Fajkis] takes the subwoofer to its logical extreme by building a rotary subwoofer on a $200 budget.\nThe principle of a rotary subwoofer is that a normal subwoofer physically moves the air, and so does a fan. If you could make a fan oscillate the air instead of only pushing it, you could turn it into such a subwoofer, which is exactly what [Daniel] did. [Daniel] mounts a large electric motor on the case of an ex-subwoofer to spin the fan. Then, he uses the rotor linkage of a model helicopter and a modified subwoofer speaker to pitch the fan blades, spinning around to create a truly impressive gust of air oscillating at as low as 1 Hz.\nThe video, after the break, is well made with some good humor, including the legendary quote: Its gonna tear apart my household, theres no way were surviving this one.\n\n\nIf that isnt enough force from a subwoofer for you, maybe this subwoofer vortex cannon is.", "title": "$200\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "$200\u306e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u56de\u8ee2\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3092\u632f\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u7a7a\u6c17\u3092\u632f\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u4f4e\u97f3\u3092\u5f37\u529b\u306b\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["$200\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "1 Hz\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u632f\u52d5\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3092\u5439\u304d\u98db\u3070\u3059\u307b\u3069\u306e\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u306e\u8feb\u529b", "\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ce\u30f3\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9"]}

If you write anything ever, you already know there are endless distractions when it comes to doing so on a computer. Sure, there always typewriters, but its difficult to do anything with the fruits of a typewriter other than scan it in or make copies, and its basically un-editable except by hand.\nInstead of just sitting down and writing, [Brendan] did what any of us would do \u00a0took the time to create an elegant solution. The Most Unusual Sentence Extractor, or MUSE, is a Raspberry Pi-based typewriter with the best of both worlds. Its essentially a word processor, but it can save to the cloud.\n[Brendan] found beautiful inspiration in the Olympia Traveller de Luxe typewriter, a delightfully boxy affair made in the 1960s and 70s with lovely keys. Starting with a 68Keys.io board, [Brendan] set about re-creating the lines of the Traveller de Luxe in Tinkercad.\nSince it doesnt really need a platen, this was the perfect place to mount a screen using black PVC. At first, [Brendan] was going to use an e-ink screen, but a mishap led to a better solution  an LCD touchscreen that makes document navigation a breeze.\nWe absolutely love the look of this machine, which was obviously a labor of love. And yeah, it does the trick:[Brendan] is writing again. Though it maybe be inconvenient, we agree that it really is nice to have a dedicated workstation for certain things.\nLooking for the complete opposite of this project? How about a Chat GPT-assisted daisywheel typewriter?", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u4fdd\u5b58\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u80b2\u5150\u3084\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u305b\u3044\u3067\u3001\u6587\u7ae0\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u7fd2\u6163\u3092\u5931\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f[Brendan]\u306f\u3001\u6e80\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002MUSE\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308bRaspberry Pi\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30a2\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30e9\u30fc\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002PVC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u753b\u9762\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u4fdd\u5b58\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30a2\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30e9\u30fc\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af", "LCD\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7279\u5225\u306a\u4f5c\u696d\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u59a8\u3052\u304b\u3089\u958b\u653e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u9023\u643a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

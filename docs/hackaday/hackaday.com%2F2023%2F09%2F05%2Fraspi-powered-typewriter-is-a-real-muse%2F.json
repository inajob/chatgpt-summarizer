If you write anything ever, you already know there are endless distractions when it comes to doing so on a computer. Sure, there always typewriters, but its difficult to do anything with the fruits of a typewriter other than scan it in or make copies, and its basically un-editable except by hand.\nInstead of just sitting down and writing, [Brendan] did what any of us would do \u00a0took the time to create an elegant solution. The Most Unusual Sentence Extractor, or MUSE, is a Raspberry Pi-based typewriter with the best of both worlds. Its essentially a word processor, but it can save to the cloud.\n[Brendan] found beautiful inspiration in the Olympia Traveller de Luxe typewriter, a delightfully boxy affair made in the 1960s and 70s with lovely keys. Starting with a 68Keys.io board, [Brendan] set about re-creating the lines of the Traveller de Luxe in Tinkercad.\nSince it doesnt really need a platen, this was the perfect place to mount a screen using black PVC. At first, [Brendan] was going to use an e-ink screen, but a mishap led to a better solution  an LCD touchscreen that makes document navigation a breeze.\nWe absolutely love the look of this machine, which was obviously a labor of love. And yeah, it does the trick:[Brendan] is writing again. Though it maybe be inconvenient, we agree that it really is nice to have a dedicated workstation for certain things.\nLooking for the complete opposite of this project? How about a Chat GPT-assisted daisywheel typewriter?"}

Easy: just build a circuit that convinces it its in the air, and the rest will take care of itself.\nNow obviously, little about [porkfreezer]s conversion of King KI 266 DME into a clock was actually easy; working with avionics rarely is. DME stands for Distance Measuring Equipment, an instrument thats part of the radio navigation suite of many aircraft. DME measures the line-of-sight distance of a plane to a ground station by measuring the time it takes for a signal to return after the plane interrogates it. The plane-mounted equipment includes a UHF transceiver and a display for the cockpit instrument panel, which accepts an analog voltage signal from the transceiver and translates it into a readout on the nice Panaplex digital display.\nRather than gutting the thing and just driving the display directly, [porkfreezer] decided to build a circuit to generate the proper signals for the DME. The board uses a PIC16 and an MCP47C dual 10-bit digital-to-analog converter to generate the voltages needed, while a USB-powered DC-DC converter provides the \u00b115 volt supply the DME display expects.\nEverything lives on a PCB that fits right on the back of the instrument. Sadly, the connector needed to mate up to the one on the instrument was outlandishly expensive  again, avionics  so [porkfreezer] had to solder the board directly to the DMEs pins. Otherwise, this would have been a completely reversible hack.\nStill, its an interesting reuse of an unusual piece of gear, and one that respects the original design as much as possible. That counts as a win in our book.", "title": "\u300c\u65e7\u578b\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6642\u8a08\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u8a08\u5668\u3092\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u8868\u793a\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001DME\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3002\u57fa\u677f\u306f\u76f4\u63a5\u8a08\u5668\u306b\u534a\u7530\u4ed8\u3051\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5143\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u9650\u308a\u5c0a\u91cd\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6539\u9020\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u65e7\u578b\u30b3\u30c3\u30af\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6642\u8a08\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u822a\u7a7a\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6642\u8a08\u306b\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0-\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5909\u63db\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u5668\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u300d", "\u300cDME\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u300d"]}

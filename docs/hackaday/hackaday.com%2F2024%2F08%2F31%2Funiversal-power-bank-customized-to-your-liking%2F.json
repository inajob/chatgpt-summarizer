Whether its a computer, kitchen appliance, or even a device that handles the electricity directly, its fairly rare to find something with software thats open and customizable. Thats why [Traditional-Code9728] is working on a power bank with an open-source firmware.\nFrom a hardware perspective the power bank is fairly open as well, with a number of options for connecting this device to anything else that might need power. It sports a bidirectional USB-C port as well as a DC barrel plug, either of which can either charge other devices or receive energy to charge its own battery. These ports can also accept energy from a solar panel and have MPPT built in. Theres also dual USB-A ports which can provide anywhere from five to 12 volts at 25 watts, and a color screen which shows the current status of the device.\nWhile this is a prototype device, its still actively being worked on. Some future planned upgrades to the power bank include a slimmer design, charge limiting features to improve battery life, and more fine-tuned control of the output voltage and current on the USB-C port. With all of the software being open-source, as well as the circuit diagram and 3D printing files, it could find itself in plenty of applications as well. This power bank also stays under the energy limits for flying on most commercial airlines as well, but if you dont plan on taking your power bank on an airplane then you might want to try out this 2000-watt monster instead."}

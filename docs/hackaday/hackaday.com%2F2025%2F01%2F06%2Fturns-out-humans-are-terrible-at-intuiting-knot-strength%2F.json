One is considerably stronger than the other.\nWhat does this mean, exactly? According to researchers, people were consistently unable to tell when presented with different knots in simple applications and asked which knot was stronger or weaker. This failure isnt because people couldnt see the knots clearly, either. Each knots structure and topology was made abundantly clear (participants were able to match knots to their schematics accurately) so its not a failure to grasp the knots structure, its just judging a knots relative strength that seems to float around in some kind of blind spot.\n\nCheck out the research paper for all the details on how things were conducted; it really does seem that a clear understanding of a knots structure does not translate to being able to easily intuit which knot will fail first, even when the difference is a considerable one. Theres a video demonstration and an online version of the experiments if youd like to try your hand at it.\nIts always interesting to discover more about our own blind spots, in part because exploiting them can result in nifty and delightful sensory illusions. We wonder if robots are any better with knots than humans?", "title": "- \u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u898b\u6975\u3081\u308b\u76f2\u70b9", "body": "\u4eba\u9593\u306f\u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u306e\u5f37\u3055\u3092\u5224\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u82e6\u624b\u3067\u3001\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u304c\u5f31\u3055\u306e\u5224\u65ad\u306b\u7e4b\u304c\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u898b\u6975\u3081\u308b\u76f2\u70b9", "- \u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30ce\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30ce\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- \u4eba\u9593\u306e\u76f4\u611f\u304c\u5931\u6557\u3059\u308b\u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u306e\u5224\u65ad", "- \u7814\u7a76\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30ce\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u5f37\u5ea6", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u7d50\u3073\u76ee\u3092\u3069\u3046\u5224\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f"]}

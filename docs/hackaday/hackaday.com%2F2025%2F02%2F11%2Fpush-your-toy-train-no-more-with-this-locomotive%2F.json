We all know the brand name, and savvy parents know to pick up the much cheaper knock-off because the kid wont know the difference. But a really cool kid shouldnt have to push their train around by hand, and thus [Lauri] has given the wooden track a real, powered, locomotive.\nIn the 3D printed chassis goes a small geared motor driving one axle, with an ESP32 and a motor driver taking care of the smarts. Power comes from an 18650 cell, which almost looks like the right scale for a fake steam boiler. The surprise with this train comes in the front axle, this machine has steering. Were curious, because isnt the whole point of a train that the track directs it where it needs to go? Or perhaps a little help is required in the absence of a childs guidance when it comes to points. Either way, with remote control we guess there would be few kids who wouldnt want one. We certainly do."}

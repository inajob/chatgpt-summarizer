This can be a bit tricky for large solar farms that feed into the grid, which require enormous battery banks or pumped storage systems to capture a reasonable amount of energy. Its much easier for small, handheld solar gadgets, which work just fine with a small rechargeable battery or even a big capacitor. [Jamie Matthews], for instance, built a loudspeaker that runs on solar power but can also work in the dark thanks to two supercapacitors.\nThe speakers 3D-printed case has a 60 x 90 mm2 solar panel mounted at the front, which charges a pair of 400 Farad supercaps. Audio input is either through a classic 3.5 mm socket or through the analog audio feature of a USB-C socket. That same USB port can also be used to directly charge the supercaps when no sunlight is available, or to attach a Bluetooth audio receiver, which in that case will be powered by the speaker.\nThe solar panel sits right next to the passive radiator before both are covered with speaker fabric.\nThe speakers outer shell, the front bezel, and even the passive radiator are 3D-printed and spray-painted. The radiator is made of a center cap that is weighed down by a couple of M4 screws and suspended in a flexible membrane. [Jamie] used glue on all openings to ensure the box remains nearly airtight, which is required for the passive radiator to work properly. Speaker fabric is used to cover the front, including the solar panel  its apparently transparent enough to let a few watts of solar power through.\nA salvaged three-inch Bose driver is the actual audio source. Its driven by a TI TPA2013D1 chip, which is a 2.7 W class-D amplifier with an integrated boost converter. This enables the chip to keep a constant output power level across a wide supply voltage range  ideal for supercapacitor operation since supercaps dont keep a constant voltage like lithium batteries do.\n[Jamie] has used the speaker for more than nine months so far and has only had to charge it twice manually. It probably helps that he lives in sunny South Africa, but weve seen similar solar audio projects work just fine in places like Denmark. If youre taking your boombox to the beach, a sunscreen reminder feature might also come in handy.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

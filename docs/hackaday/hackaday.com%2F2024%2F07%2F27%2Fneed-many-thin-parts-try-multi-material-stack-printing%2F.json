An old(er) solution is to use a non-extruding \u201cironing\u201d step between each layer, which makes them easier to pull apart. But another trick is to use the fact that PLA and PETG don\u2019t stick well to each other to your advantage. And thus is born multi-material stack printing. (Video, embedded below the break.)\n[Jonathan] wants to print out multiples of his fun Multiboard mounting system backplates, and these are the ideal candidate for stack printing: they\u2019re thin, but otherwise take up the entire build plate. As you\u2019d expect, the main trick is to print thin layers of PETG between the PLA plate layers that you do want. He demonstrates that you can then simply pull them apart.\nThere are some tricks, though. First is to make two pillars in addition to the plates, which apparently convinces the slicer to not flatten all the layers together. (We don\u2019t really understand why, honestly, but we don\u2019t use Bambu slicer for multi-materials.) The other trick that we expect to be more widely applicable, is that [Jonathan] extrudes the PETG interlayers a little thicker than normally. Because the PETG overflows the lower PLA layer, it physically locks on even though it chemically doesn\u2019t. This probably requires some experimentation.\nAs multi-material printers get cheaper, we\u2019ve seen a lot more innovative uses for them popping up. And we wouldn\u2019t be so stoked about the topic if there weren\u2019t a variety of hacker projects to make it possible. Most recently, the impressive system from [Armored_Turtle] has caught our eye. Who knows what kind of crazy applications we\u2019ll see in the future? Are you doing multi-material yet?\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u7a4d\u5c64\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u8584\u30443D\u5370\u5237\u7269\u3092\u7a4d\u307f\u91cd\u306d\u3066\u5206\u96e2\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002PLA\u3068PETG\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u7a4d\u5c64\u5370\u5237\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u4e2d\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u6539\u5584\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3084PLA\u306e\u7a4d\u5c64\u5370\u5237\u3092\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u7a4d\u5c64\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3068PLA\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5370\u5237\u6280\u6cd5", "DIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u5411\u3051\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

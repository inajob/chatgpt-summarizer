Youll also need a microcontroller (in this case, an Arduino Nano), a L293D motor driver IC, a 9 V battery, and\u00a0some jumper wires.\nThe video goes into detail about how the two wheels connected to one motor each can move the robot in various directions: forward, backward, left, and right. The motors can be made to spin either forward or backward, depending on the polarity of the power supply, using an H-bridge circuit.\nThe L293D motor driver IC powers and controls the motors connected to the wheels. The L293D takes its commands from the Arduino. The rest of the video is spent going over the software for controlling the wheels.\nWhen youre ready to go to the next level, you might enjoy this robot dog.\n\n"}

The Amiga 500 has had less attention, in part due to its greater level of sophistication. However, you can now order a brand-new Amiga-compatible PCB if youre looking to put together a machine from surplus parts.\nThe design is known as Denise, and is apparently the work of an anonymous Swedish designer according to the Tindie listing. Its not a direct replica of any one Amiga machine. Instead, its best described as a compact A500+ compatible motherboard with two Zorro2 slots and a few additional features.\nDenise is\u00a0just\u00a0a PCB, though. No emulated chips or other components are included. To use the PCB, youll need a full set of Amiga custom chips and a suitable Motorola 68000-series CPU to suit. It can be used with either OCS or ECS chipsets. At this stage, its only verified to work with the 2MB version of the Agnus chip, though the creators believe it should work with a 1MB Diet Agnus.\u00a0 Some modern conveniences are on hand, too. A pair of microcontrollers will allow the use of Amiga or PC keyboards, along with Amiga or PS/2 style mice, including support for scroll wheels.\nGiven the number of damaged, battered, and corroded Amiga PCBs out there, its great that there is a source of fresh, new PCBs for restoration purposes.

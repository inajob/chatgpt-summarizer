Its CES time once again in Las Vegas, and you know what that means  some wacky technologies like this AI pet door that rejects dead mice.\nThen its on to Whats That Sound, which Kristina managed to nail for once. Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound this week? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nBut then its on to the hacks, beginning with a new keyboard from [Joe Scotto] and an exploration of all you can do with an LED strip, like 1D fireworks and roller coasters without any moving parts. From there, we marvel at the ability of sound waves to extinguish flames, and the tech behind life as a quadriplegic. Finally, we examine not one, but two of Jenny Lists finely-crafted rants, one about web browsers, and the other about the responsible use of new technology.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 252 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nCES 2024 live: Latest tech, weird gadgets and our Best of CES awards\nNew images reveal what Neptune and Uranus really look like\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out this form with your best guess, and you might win!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nX1Plus: Open Source Bambu Lab X1 Firmware\n\nRooted: The Good the Bad and Freedom of Choice\n\n\nThe ScottoKatana Keyboard Is Cutting-Edge\n1D Fireworks Are Nice And Quiet\n\nLine Wobbler  Robin Baumgarten: Playful Installation Art\nHow To Make A Model Roller Coaster Without Any Moving Parts\n\n\nRemote-Control Kinetic Sand Table Uses A Single Arduino\n\nControlling two linear motions of an object 1a  YouTube\n\n\n[Thomas Sanladerer] Gets New Threads\n\nPutting 3D Printed Screw Threads To The Test\n\n\nUsing Sound Waves As A Fire Extinguisher\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nHow To Build A Fully Offline Smart Home, Or Why You Should Not\n37C3: The Tech Behind Life With Quadriplegia\nHalf Power Bank, Half Spot Welder\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\nThere Are Stradi-various Ways To Make A Violin, And This Is One\nSandpaper Alternatives For 3D Prints\nNot Dead Yet: Microsoft Peripherals Get Licensed To Onward Brands\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nThe World Of Web Browsers Is In A Bad Way\n\nComparison of browser engines  Wikipedia\n\n\nA Few Reasonable Rules For The Responsible Use Of New Technology\n\nWhat Uses More Power Than Argentina But Doesn\u2019t Dance The Tango?\n\n\n", "title": "- CES 2024\u3067\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u767a\u898b", "body": "CES\u3067AI\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u3084LED\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u97f3\u6ce2\u3067\u708e\u3092\u6d88\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001Web\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u610f\u898b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- CES 2024\u3067\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u767a\u898b", "- \u30cd\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u30a6\u30e9\u30cc\u30b9\u306e\u771f\u306e\u59ff\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u516c\u958b", "- \u97f3\u6ce2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u708e\u3092\u6d88\u3059\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u306b\u611f\u5606", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u30a5\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "- \u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3068\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u8cac\u4efb\u3042\u308b\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8003\u5bdf"]}

Thats OK, especially when the main project is large and complex, In that case, side-quest projects provide a deliverable that can help keep the momentum of the whole project going. The mojo must flow, after all.\nThat seems to be whats going on with this beautiful split-flap clock build by [Erich Styger]. Its part of a much larger effort which will eventually see 64 separate split-flap units chained together. This project has been going on for a while; we first featured it back in 2022 when it was more of a prototype. Each unit is scratch-built, using laser-cut fiberboard for parts like the spool and frame, thin PVC stock for the flip cards, and CNC-cut vinyl for the letters and numbers. Each unit is powered by its own stepper motor.\nTo turn four of these displays into a clock, [Erich] milled up a very nice enclosure from beech. From the outside its very clean and simple, almost like something from Ikea, but the inside face of the enclosure is quite complex. [Erich] had to mill a lot of nooks and crannies into the wood to provide mounting space and clearance for the split-flap mechanism, plus a thinned-down area at the top of each window to serve as a stop for the flaps. The four displays are controlled by a single controller board, which houses an NXP K22FN512 microcontroller along with four stepper drivers and interfaces for the Hall-effect sensors needed to home each display. Theres also an RS-485 interface that lets the controllers daisy-chain together, which is how the big 64-character display will be controlled.\nWere looking forward to that, but in the meantime, enjoy the soft but pleasant flappy goodness of the clock in the brief video below.\n\n", "title": "- \u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u652f\u3048\u308b\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u30a8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30ac\u30fc\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306f\u300164\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3067\u3001\u5404\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u72ec\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u652f\u3048\u308b\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3068\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- 64\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u9023\u7d50\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5c55\u671b"]}

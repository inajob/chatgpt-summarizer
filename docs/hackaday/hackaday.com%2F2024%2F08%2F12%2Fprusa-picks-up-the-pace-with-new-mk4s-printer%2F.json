Thats because Prusas machines are designed to be upgraded and modified as time goes on. An upgrade kit is always released to allow each older printer to be converted into its successor, and while theres occasionally been some debate about whether or not its the most cost-effective choice, at least it is a choice you have as an owner.\nIf youve got a Prusa MK4, youll soon get to make that decision for yourself. Announced earlier today, the new MK4S brings some notable changes to last years printer. The $99 upgrade is scheduled to be available by the end of the month for existing owners, but if youve been on the fence about joining Team Orange and Black, you can purchase the MK4S right now in both kit and assembled forms for the same price ($799 and $1,099 respectively) as the previous MK4.\n\nThe front panel of the MK4S is now injection molded.\nSo, whats new with the MK4S? With speed an increasingly hot topic in the 3D printing community, it should come as little surprise to find this new machine is even faster than its predecessor. A reworked cooling system and new high-flow nozzle mean Prusas latest can spit out everyones favorite little boat in 14 minutes\u2014or as little as 8 minutes if you dont mind a slight drop in print quality.\nThe announcement post also cites improvements to the machines printed structural components. Parts that were previously made in PETG are now being printed in carbon fiber-infused polycarbonate. Some parts, such as the front panel, have even been switched over to injection molding.\nWhile describing the changes made with the MK4s, the blog post also clarified Prusas position regarding open sourcing of their printers. There was considerable concern back in March of 2023 when the company announced it was reconsidering its traditional dedication to making its hardware and software as open  as much as possible  in light of increased commercial competition. But now the company has posted a chart on their site that explains not only whats being shared for each of their printers, but a timeline as to when we can expect it.\nThe GPIO hackerboard\nWhile it hasnt been updated for the 4S yet, the overview shows that the company plans on holding onto the design files for the MK4 PCBs until the end of the products life. Otherwise, it seems their current flagship printer is equally as open as the MK3 that came before it. While a time-limited source release will likely rub some in the wrong way, the reality is that its more than youd get with pretty much any other 3D printer manufacturer out there.\nThe announcement also talks briefly about the new GPIO \u201cHackerboard\u201d that the company will start shipping in September. The $15 board plugs into an expansion connector on the PCB of the MK4 or MK4S, and provides eight pins that can be toggled via G-Code sent to the printer. These could be used for all sorts of automation tasks, such as turning on the lights and fans inside of an enclosure or triggering the shutter on a camera. Theres not much detail about this particular add-on yet, but its certainly something well be keeping a close eye on.\n", "title": "Prusa\u30ea\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\uff1a\u5e38\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "body": "Prusa Research\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306f\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002MK4S\u306f\u524d\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3088\u308a\u901f\u304f\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3084\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3001\u65b0\u7d20\u6750\u306b\u3082\u5909\u66f4\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001MK4S\u306b\u306fGPIO\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Prusa\u30ea\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\uff1a\u5e38\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "Prusa MK4S\uff1a\u9ad8\u901f\u5370\u5237\u3068\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "Prusa MK4S\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1a\u5c04\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Prusa\u793e\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u65b9\u91dd\uff1aMK4\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u516c\u958b\u306e\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u5c55\u671b", "GPIO\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1aPrusa MK4\u304a\u3088\u3073MK4S\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u62e1\u5f35\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

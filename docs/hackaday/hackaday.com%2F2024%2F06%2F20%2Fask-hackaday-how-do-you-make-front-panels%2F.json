The closer a project is to completion, the less enthusiasm we have for it. Once the main design is clearly going to work on a breadboard, were ready to move on to the next one. We dont mind the PCB layout, especially with modern tools. However, once the board is done, you have to do the case. Paradoxically, this was easier in the old days because you just picked some stock box, drilled some holes, and while it looked terrible, it was relatively easy.\nToday, the bar is much higher. Youll probably 3D print or laser cut an enclosure. If it looks no better than what you did in the 1970s, you wont win many admirers. We routinely cover projects that could easily pass for commercial products. So how do you do it?\nThe Parts\nThe enclosure may even be the easy part. There are plenty of scripts and generators that will make you a nice box that meets your specifications. You can probably even get the holes made as you build. Back in the day, it was a challenge to cut odd-shaped holes for things like serial port connectors. Now, no problem. The printer or laser will just make a hole with any shape you like. You may even want to try a new angle on 3D printing.\nMounting the PCB isnt that hard, either. With 3D printing, you can create standoffs, but even if you laser cut, you can easily use conventional standoffs. In a pinch, weve used long bolts with nuts.\nThe real problem, it seems to us, is the front panel. Only Star Trek can get away with front panels containing a bunch of knobs and dials with no markings. And although we call them front panels, sometimes you need markings on the back or even the sides, too.\nFront Panel Options\nThere are companies that will make front panels for you, and those are usually silk-screened with legends. You could, of course, silk screen yourself if you have the ability to do that. What are your other options?\nLabels cant match a laminated cover.\nLabels arent going to cut it anymore. However, you can use rub on letters if you are very careful. Weve used water slide paper  the same kind you see in model kits. You can find water slide paper that will run through computer printers.\nAnother option is to do the toner transfer trick you often see for PCBs, but use it on your front panel. Since that takes heat, it isnt going to work on 3D-printed panels, though. For that matter, you can just use a PCB as a front panel and then make it the same way you make other boards. Silk screening is easy, then, and heres a secret: you can make PCBs with no copper on them at all! You can even use them for the entire enclosure.\nWe have seen good-looking laminated color prints that look better than labels. If you dont want to do your own printing, sign companies can print Dibond aluminum, which works well. You can laser engrave acrylic and fill the engraved areas with ink or wax for contrast or even use a two-tone material made for laser etching.\nThe video below uses multicolor 3D printing to create custom panels in a way we havent seen before. These panels go in an airplane simulator and are made to have good visibility in different lighting conditions.\n\nOver To You\nWhats your go-to method for creating marks on panels? When do you go through the trouble? After all, if you are building a one-off piece of gear for your own use, maybe a label maker is all you really need. Let us know in the comments. The good news is that there are many ways to make great-looking panels now. The bad news is now we are expected to make them!", "title": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u5b8c\u6210\u306b\u8fd1\u3065\u304f\u307b\u3069\u3001\u8208\u5473\u304c\u8584\u308c\u308b\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u4f5c\u6210\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u88fd\u54c1\u3068\u540c\u69d8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u591a\u304f\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066", "\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1a\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3084\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u3082", "\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u304b\u3089\u5370\u5237\u307e\u3067\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u8868\u9762\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1a\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u307e\u3067", "\u9298\u677f\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u9632\u6c34\u7d19\u3084PCB\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

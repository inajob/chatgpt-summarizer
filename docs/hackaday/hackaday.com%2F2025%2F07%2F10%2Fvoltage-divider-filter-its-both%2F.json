So, a typical theoretical voltage divider is simply two resistors. But if you examine a low-pass RC filter, youll see a single resistor and a capacitor. What if you combine them? Thats what [Old Hack EE] did in a recent video, and you can check it out below.\nIt helps if you are familiar with Thevenin equivalents and, of course, Ohms Law. Theres also a bit of algebra, but nothing too complicated. The example design has a lossy filter at 100 Hz.\nOf course, RC filters are easy to understand if you think of them as voltage dividers with a frequency-variable resistance, which is what the math is basically saying. The load impedance, in this case, is R2 in parallel with Xc at a given frequency.\nHe mentions that you might find a circuit like this in a power supply. However, it is also common to see this circuit wherever a divider drives a load with capacitance or even parasitic capacitance in cables or circuit boards.\nWeve discussed Thevenin equivalence modeling before. If you want really good filters, you are probably going to need op-amps.\n\n"}

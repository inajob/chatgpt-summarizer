So, a typical theoretical voltage divider is simply two resistors. But if you examine a low-pass RC filter, youll see a single resistor and a capacitor. What if you combine them? Thats what [Old Hack EE] did in a recent video, and you can check it out below.\nIt helps if you are familiar with Thevenin equivalents and, of course, Ohms Law. Theres also a bit of algebra, but nothing too complicated. The example design has a lossy filter at 100 Hz.\nOf course, RC filters are easy to understand if you think of them as voltage dividers with a frequency-variable resistance, which is what the math is basically saying. The load impedance, in this case, is R2 in parallel with Xc at a given frequency.\nHe mentions that you might find a circuit like this in a power supply. However, it is also common to see this circuit wherever a divider drives a load with capacitance or even parasitic capacitance in cables or circuit boards.\nWeve discussed Thevenin equivalence modeling before. If you want really good filters, you are probably going to need op-amps.\n\n", "title": "RC\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u790e\uff1a\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "body": "\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3067\u306f\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u7121\u8996\u3057\u304c\u3061\u3002RC\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u3092\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8003\u5bdf\u3002", "titles": ["RC\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u790e\uff1a\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "\u96fb\u5727\u5206\u5272\u5668\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eRC\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7406\u89e3", "\u30c6\u30d6\u30ca\u30f3\u306e\u5b9a\u7406\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3067\u306e\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

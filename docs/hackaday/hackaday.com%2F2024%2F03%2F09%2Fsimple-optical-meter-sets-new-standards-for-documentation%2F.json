Its a snap-on interface for electric meters, dubbed so because its 3D printable shell looks like a pig nose, and it works with IEC62056-21 compliant meters. If you want to learn about your homes power consumption in real time and your meter happens to fit the bill, look into building a PiggyMeter, its the kind of DIY project that a hacker was destined to design at some point.\nAll you need is a printed shell, a Wemos-compatible development board with an ESP32 MCU, an optical interface board, and a few small parts like a ring magnet. The optical interface board is not open source, but theres drawings available, and the design is pretty simple, so it should be trivial to recreate. Plus, its also reasonably inexpensive if you dont want to build your own board. Got parts? Simply put them all together, flash the firmware, and you have a meter adapter added to your smart home device family.\nThis device works with HomeAssistant, and its incredibly easy to set up, in part because of just how clearly everything is outlined in the blog post. Seriously, the documentation is written with love, and it shows. If youre looking to learn how to document a device in a helpful way, take notes from the PiggyMeter. And, if youd like to learn more about optically coupled power meter interfaces, heres a different open source project weve covered before!"}

WattWise from [Naveen Kulandaivelu] is a tool which changes all that, its a command-line interface (CLI) for power monitoring smart plugs.\nWritten in Python, the tool can talk either directly to TP-Link branded smart plugs, or via Home Assistant. It tracks the power consumption with a simple graph, but the exciting part lies in how it can be used to throttle the CPU of a computer in order to use power at the points in the day when it is cheapest. You can find the code in a GitHub repository.\nWe like the idea of using smart plugs as instruments, even if they may not be the most accurate of measurement tools. It takes them even further beyond the simple functionality and walled-garden interfaces provided by their manufacturers, which in our view can only be a good thing.\nMeanwhile, for further reading weve looked at smart plugs in detail in the past.", "title": "- \u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u300cWattWise\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "WattWise\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3092\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u7ba1\u7406\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u300cWattWise\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Python\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u96fb\u529b\u76e3\u8996\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u5bb6\u5ead\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u6539\u5584", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fCPU\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- \u3088\u308a\u6df1\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308bWattWise\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9"]}

That means showcasing the best and most interesting examples they can find, from the vintage to the ultra-modern. Where are all these wonderful toys coming from, you might ask? Why, the Hackaday community, of course.\nThis is a rare chance to show off your prized gadgetry to a captive audience of hackers and makers. Whether its a custom display youve created or some gonzo piece of hardware youve been holding onto for years, nows the time to haul it out. However, there are only a few days left to submit your display for potential inclusion, so if youve got something you want the Hackaday community to see, make sure you fill out the form before the September 16th deadline. Thats Monday, if you were wondering.\n\nThe folks at the DesignLab tell us theyve already got some very cool pieces of hardware lined up, many of which readers will recognize from these pages. Were eager to get up close and personal with some of these incredible creations weve covered over the years, and were willing to bet many of the Supercon attendees will, too.\nWhile we dont want to give away too much, heres a quick look at a couple of the displays currently slated for exhibition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe More the Merrier\nWhile there are some truly gorgeous examples lined up for the November exhibit, there are still a few gaps in the collection wed love to see addressed. If youve got any of the following that youd like to show off, please dont hesitate to get in touch:\n\nUnique LCDs (I.E. Tiger handhelds)\nVintage Displays\nCRTs (All Types)\nPlasma Displays\nNixie Clocks/Displays\nAnything Custom Built\nVideo Synthesizers\n\nFor some of those, like CRTs, submissions would ideally come from the Southern California area. But in general, submissions from all over the globe are welcome.\nIf youve been holding off on submitting because youre worried somebody else has sent in for the same thing, dont be. Showing different permutations of a particular display technology is a bit part of the exhibit  wed rather have too many Nixie clocks to choose from than not enough.\nWhatever youd like to show off, just make sure you submit it before the end of the weekend!"}

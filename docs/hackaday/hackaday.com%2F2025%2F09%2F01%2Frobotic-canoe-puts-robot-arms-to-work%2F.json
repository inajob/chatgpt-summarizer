Sufficiently unbothered by the prospect of mixing electronics and water, [Dave] augmented a canoe with twin, paddle-bearing robotic arms to bring to life a concept he had: the RowboBoat. The result? A canoe that can paddle itself with robotic arms, leaving the operator free to take a deep breath, sit back, and concentrate on not capsizing.\nThere are a couple of things we really like about this build, one of which is the tidiness of the robotic platform that non-destructively attaches to the canoe itself with custom brackets. A combination of aluminum extrusion and custom brackets, [Dave] designed it with the help of 3D scanning the canoe as a design aid. A canoe, after all, has nary a straight edge nor a right angle in sight. Being able to pull a 3D model into CAD helps immensely in such cases; we have also seen this technique used in refitting a van into an off-grid camper.\nThe other thing we like is the way that [Dave] drives the arms.\u00a0The two PiPER robotic arms are driven with ROS, the Robot Operating System on a nearby Jetson Orin Nano SBC. The clever part is the way [Dave] observed that padding and steering a canoe has a lot in common with a differential drive, which is akin to how a tank works. And so, for propulsion, ROS simply treats the paddle-bearing arms as though they were wheels in a differential drive. The arms dont seem to mind a little water, and the rest of the electronics are protected by a pair of firmly-crossed fingers.\nThe canoe steers by joystick, but being driven by ROS it could be made autonomous with a little more work. [Dave] has his configuration and code for RowboBoat up on GitHub should anyone wish to take a closer look. Watch it in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u52d5\u64cd\u7e26\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u300cRowboBoat\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "body": "\u30c0\u30d6\u6c0f\u306f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u88c5\u5099\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30d1\u30c9\u30eb\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u300cRowboBoat\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u52d5\u64cd\u7e26\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u300cRowboBoat\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u6c34\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u3092\u30d1\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059", "- ROS\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u64cd\u7e26", "- 3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30ab\u30cc\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

The result of his work is a smart PCB on which the speed is indicated with a row of LEDs.\nThe sensor is a straightforward affair, a reed switch with a magnet on a wheel, which is sensed by an ESP8266. The six LEDs are charlieplexeed over three lines. To keep the supply voltage correct for the ESP from the uncertain state of a lithium battery, a small buck-boost module is used. Sadly the code doesnt seem to make the speed available via the wireless part of the processor, but were guessing that a bit of extra software work could fix that.\nThe result when put in a box on the handlebars, is a smart but simple instrument that would aid any bike. Its by no means the first one weve brought you and we doubt it will be the last."}

The result of his work is a smart PCB on which the speed is indicated with a row of LEDs.\nThe sensor is a straightforward affair, a reed switch with a magnet on a wheel, which is sensed by an ESP8266. The six LEDs are charlieplexeed over three lines. To keep the supply voltage correct for the ESP from the uncertain state of a lithium battery, a small buck-boost module is used. Sadly the code doesnt seem to make the speed available via the wireless part of the processor, but were guessing that a bit of extra software work could fix that.\nThe result when put in a box on the handlebars, is a smart but simple instrument that would aid any bike. Its by no means the first one weve brought you and we doubt it will be the last.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002ESP8266\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057LED\u3067\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4fee\u6b63\u3067\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u901a\u4fe1\u7d4c\u7531\u3067\u901f\u5ea6\u53d6\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u7bb1\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u304b\u3064\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "ESP8266\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u8a08\u6e2c", "LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8LED\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u7528\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

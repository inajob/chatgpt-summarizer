But that doesnt mean theres not a ton of interesting stuff going on with this one, so buckle up.\nOne spike at the fundamental and not much more.\nThe project is by [Basin Street Design], who doesnt really offer much by way of inspiration for this undertaking, nor a discussion on what this will be used for. But the design goals are pretty clear: build an oscillator with as little distortion as possible across the audio frequency range.\nThe basic circuit is the well-known Wien bridge oscillator where the R-C pairs are switched in and out of the feedback loop to achieve frequency range control. This was accomplished with rotary switches rebuilt from their original configuration in a Heathkit IG-18 sine/square wave generator, a defunct instrument that was gutted and used as an enclosure for this build. There are a lot of other treats here, too, like the automatic gain control (AGC) that uses a homebrew voltage-controlled resistor made from an incandescent lamp and a cadmium sulfide photoresistor glued inside a piece of brake line, and an output attenuator made from discrete resistors that drops the output in 10 dB steps while maintaining an overall 75-Ohm impedance.\nBut at the end of the day, it all comes down to that single spike on the spectrum analyzer, with no apparent harmonics. To make sure there wasnt something hiding down in the noise, [Basin Street] added a notch filter to lower the fundamental by 60 dB, allowing the spectrum analyzer sensitivity to be cranked way up. Harmonics were visible, but so far down into the noise  as low as -115 dBc  that its hardly worth mentioning.\nTheres a lot more detail in this one, so dive in and enjoy. If you want another take on Wien bridge circuits, check out this recent LM386-based oscillator. Just dont expect such low distortion with that one.", "title": "\u97f3\u58f0\u632f\u52d5\u5b50\u306e\u4f4e\u6b6a\u307f\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\uff1a\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5168\u3066\u3092\u7269\u8a9e\u308b", "body": "\u300c\u4f4e\u3044\u6b6a\u307f\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u767a\u632f\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u76ee\u6a19\u306e\u3082\u3068\u3001\u30ef\u30a4\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u767a\u632f\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5b9f\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c0\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u6210\u5206\u306e\u305f\u3063\u305f1\u3064\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3082\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u97f3\u58f0\u632f\u52d5\u5b50\u306e\u4f4e\u6b6a\u307f\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\uff1a\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5168\u3066\u3092\u7269\u8a9e\u308b", "\u5e45\u5e83\u3044\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u7bc4\u56f2\u3067\u6b6a\u307f\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30d6\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u5909\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fAGC\u306875\u03a9\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30d7\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30c6\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u57cb\u3082\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b harmonic \u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30ce\u30c3\u30c1\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "Wien\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5225\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\uff1aLM386\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u6b6a\u307f\u306e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u671f\u5f85"]}

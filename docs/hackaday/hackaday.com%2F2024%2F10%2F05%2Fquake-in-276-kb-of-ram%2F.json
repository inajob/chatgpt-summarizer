But in the modern world, we can get better performance than the 386 processor required to run the 1993 shooter for the cost of a dinner at a nice restaurant  with plenty of other embedded systems blowing these original minimum system requirements out of the water.\nFor a much tougher challenge, a group from Silicon Labs decided to port DOOMs successor, Quake, to the Arduino Nano Matter Board platform instead even though this platform has some pretty significant limitations for a game as advanced as Quake.\nTo begin work on the memory problem, the group began with a port of Quake originally designed for Windows, allowing them to use a modern Windows machine to whittle down the memory usage before moving over to hardware. They do have a flash memory module available as well, but theres a speed penalty with this type of memory. To improve speed they did what any true gamer would do with their system: overclock the processor. This got them to around 10 frames per second, which is playable, but not particularly enjoyable. The further optimizations to improve the FPS required a much deeper dive which included generating lookup tables instead of relying on computation, optimizing some of the original C programming, coding some functions in assembly, and only refreshing certain sections of the screen when needed.\nOn a technical level, Quake was a dramatic improvement over DOOM, allowing for things like real-time 3D rendering, polygonal models instead of sprites, and much more intricate level design. As a result, ports of this game tend to rely on much more powerful processors than DOOM ports and this team shows real mastery of their hardware to pull off a build with a system with these limitations. Other Quake ports weve seen like this one running on an iPod Classic require a similar level of knowledge of the code and the ability to use assembly language to make optimizations.\nThanks to [Nicola] for the tip!", "title": "\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30a8\u30ad\u30be\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u306eDOOM\u3092\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b5\u30fc\u30af\u30eb\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u5100\u5f0f\u7684\u306a\u884c\u4e8b\u3060\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u3067\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u8981\u4ef6\u3092\u51cc\u99d5\u3059\u308b\u591a\u304f\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002Silicon Labs\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001Arduino Nano Matter Board\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306bQuake\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30a8\u30ad\u30be\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b", "\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30e9\u30dc\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u304cQuake\u3092Arduino Nano Matter Board\u306b\u79fb\u690d", "\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u554f\u984c\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080: Quake\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6539\u5584\u7b56", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u3066FPS\u3092\u6539\u5584", "Quake\u306e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6027\u306b\u6311\u6226: \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5236\u9650\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b"]}

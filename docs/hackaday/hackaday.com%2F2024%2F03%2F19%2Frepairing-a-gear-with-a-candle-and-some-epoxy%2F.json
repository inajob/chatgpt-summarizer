Thats the issue [Well Done Tips] faced with a plastic gear from a lawnmower. While wed be tempted to scan the gear, repair the damage in CAD and then 3D print a new one, we enjoyed hearing about his low-tech solution. In addition to the write up, theres a video showing the process you can watch below.\nThe idea is pretty simple. Using a piece of pipe and melted candle wax, he prepared a mold of an undamaged section of the gear. Then he cast epoxy resin in place to recreate the missing pieces. There are a few tricks, like putting holes in the remaining part of the gear so the epoxy flows into the existing part. Depending on the gears purpose and original material, you might be able to just use it as-is. However, you could also use the repaired gear as a template to create another mold and then cast an entire gear from resin or even metal if you can cast metal.\nYou can argue whether resin is better or worse than PLA, but of course, it depends on the kind of resin\u2014photopolymers are different from epoxy resins youd use for this sort of thing. If you think you might like to make your new gear out of aluminum, you might find some inspiration in a previous post.\n\n", "title": "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4f4e\u6280\u8853\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30c0\u30f3\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u829d\u5208\u308a\u6a5f\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u6b20\u640d\u90e8\u5206\u3092\u578b\u53d6\u308a\u3057\u3001\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u6a39\u8102\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u4f4e\u6280\u8853\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u304c\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u5143\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u91d1\u578b\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u6a39\u8102\u3084\u91d1\u5c5e\u3067\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4f4e\u6280\u8853\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30ef\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u6a39\u8102\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ae\u30a2\u306e\u518d\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "\uff13D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u6a39\u8102\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ae\u30a2\u4fee\u7406", "\u30ea\u30da\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u5143\u306b\u91d1\u5c5e\u88fd\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u6a39\u8102\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ae\u30a2\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

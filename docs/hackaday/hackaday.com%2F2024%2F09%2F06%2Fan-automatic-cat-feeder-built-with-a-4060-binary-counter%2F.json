Some rely on the Internet of Things, and some rely on fancy microcontrollers. [Larry Cook], on the other hand, built his using a simple 4060 binary counter chip.\nThe feeder is built out of old plywood, and the whole thing runs off an old 12-volt DC wall wart and a lead-acid battery to keep it going in a power outage. The dry cat food is stored in hopper above a drum, with the drum\u00a0 rotated by a 12-volt DC gearmotor. The gearmotor is activated on a schedule\u2014either every 4 hours, or every 5.5 hours, depending on setting. Theres then a four-digit 7-segment display for counting the total number of feedings.\nThe manner of operation is simple. The 4060 binary counter slowly counts up to 8,196 on a 1.11 Hz or 0.83 Hz clock, for four hour or 5.5 hour operation respectively. When it hits that threshold, it fires the gear motor. The gear motor then rotates the drum for one revolution, dumping a preset amount of food. At the end of a revolution, it triggers a hall sensor which resets the circuit.\nThe best thing about this design? Its been in service for ten years. [Larrys] original video is a big contrast to his latest one, but it shows the same feeder doing the same job, all this time.\nWe love a good cat feeder, and its great to see one built with simple old-school parts, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Cprossu for the tip!]"}

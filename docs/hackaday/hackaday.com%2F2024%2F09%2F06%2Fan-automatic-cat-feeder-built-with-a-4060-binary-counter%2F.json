Some rely on the Internet of Things, and some rely on fancy microcontrollers. [Larry Cook], on the other hand, built his using a simple 4060 binary counter chip.\nThe feeder is built out of old plywood, and the whole thing runs off an old 12-volt DC wall wart and a lead-acid battery to keep it going in a power outage. The dry cat food is stored in hopper above a drum, with the drum\u00a0 rotated by a 12-volt DC gearmotor. The gearmotor is activated on a schedule\u2014either every 4 hours, or every 5.5 hours, depending on setting. Theres then a four-digit 7-segment display for counting the total number of feedings.\nThe manner of operation is simple. The 4060 binary counter slowly counts up to 8,196 on a 1.11 Hz or 0.83 Hz clock, for four hour or 5.5 hour operation respectively. When it hits that threshold, it fires the gear motor. The gear motor then rotates the drum for one revolution, dumping a preset amount of food. At the end of a revolution, it triggers a hall sensor which resets the circuit.\nThe best thing about this design? Its been in service for ten years. [Larrys] original video is a big contrast to his latest one, but it shows the same feeder doing the same job, all this time.\nWe love a good cat feeder, and its great to see one built with simple old-school parts, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Cprossu for the tip!]", "title": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u732b\u306e\u7d66\u990c\u5668", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306a4060\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u732b\u7528\u7d66\u990c\u6a5f\u304c10\u5e74\u9593\u7a3c\u50cd\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30014\u6642\u9593\u304b5.5\u6642\u9593\u3054\u3068\u306b\u7d66\u990c\u3057\u3001\u6570\u5024\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u9811\u4e08\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u732b\u306e\u7d66\u990c\u5668", "4060\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u732b\u7d66\u990c\u5668", "12V DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u732b\u7d66\u990c\u6a5f", "10\u5e74\u9593\u7a3c\u50cd\u3059\u308b\u732b\u306e\u7d66\u990c\u5668", "\u53e4\u3044\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u732b\u7528\u7d66\u990c\u6a5f"]}

While printing a copy for personal use this is rarely an issue, things can get a lot more complicated when you make and distribute a derived version of a particular model.\nCase in the point the ever popular 3DBenchy model, which was intended to serve as a diagnostic aid by designer [Creative Tools]. Although folks have been spinning up their own versions of this benchmark print for years, such derivative works were technically forbidden by the original models license  a fact that the company is now starting to take seriously, with derivative models reportedly getting pulled from Printables.\nThe license for the 3DBenchy model is (and always has been) the Creative Commons BY-ND 4.0, which requires attribution and forbids distributing of derivative works. This means that legally any derived version of this popular model being distributed on Thingiverse, Printables, etc. is illegal, as already noted seven years ago by an observant user on Reddit. According to the message received by a Printables user, all derived 3DBenchy models will be removed from the site while the license is now (belatedly) being enforced.\nAlthough its going to be a bit of an adjustment with this license enforcement, ultimately the idea of Creative Commons licenses was that they set clear rules for usage, which become meaningless if not observed.\nThanks to [JohnU] for the tip."}

So whats so exciting about this single-voltage linear power supply? Honestly, nothing  until you start looking at its thermally compensated current limiting circuit.\nThis one is by [DiodeGoneWild], who youve really got to hand it to in terms of both the empirical effort he went through to optimize the circuit, as well as the quality of his explanation. The basic circuit is dead simple: a transformer, a full-wave rectifier, an LD1085 adjustable regulator  a low-dropout version of the venerable LM317  and associated filter caps and trimmer pot to adjust the output between 2.2 and 5.5 volts.\nThe current limiting circuit, though, is where things get interesting. Rather than use an op-amp, [DiodeGoneWild] chose a simple discrete transistor current-sense circuit. To make it less susceptible to thermal drift, he experimented with multiple configurations of resistors and Schottky diodes over a wide range of temperatures, from deep-freeze cold to hair-dryer-in-a-box hot. His data table and the resulting graph of current versus temperature are works of art, and they allowed him to make sensible component selections for a fixed 250-mA current limit with a reasonably flat thermal response.\nAs for construction, its all classic [DiodeGoneWild], including a PCB with traces ground out with a Dremel and a recycled heat sink. He also dropped a couple of interesting build techniques, like adding leads to turn SMD tantalum caps into through-hole components. The video below shows all the build details along with the exhaustive breadboard testing.\nFrom taking on a potentially risky magnetron teardown to harvesting lasers from headlights, theres always something to learn from a [DiodeGoneWild] video.\n\n"}

If you arent familiar with LORAN, it was a common radio navigation technique before GPS took over everything.\nLORAN  an acronym for Long Range Navigation  was a US byproduct of World War II and was similar in many ways to Britains Gee system. However, LORAN operated at lower frequencies to improve its range. It was instrumental in helping convoys cross the Atlantic and also found use in the Pacific theater.\n\n\nHow it Worked\nThe video shows a Loran-A receiver, which, in its day, would have been known as LORAN. The A was added after versions B and C appeared. Back in the 1940s, something like this with a CRT and precision electronics would have been very expensive.\nUnlike GPS, keeping a highly synchronized clock over many stations was impractical at the time. So, LORAN stations operated in pairs on different frequencies and with a known distance between the two. The main station sends a blip. When the secondary station hears the blip, it sends its own blip. Sometimes there were multiple secondaries, too.\nIf you receive both blips, you can measure the time between them and use it to get an idea of where you are. Suppose the stations were 372 miles apart. That means the secondary will hear the blip roughly 2 milliseconds after the primary sends it (the speed of light is about 186 miles per millisecond). You can characterize how much the secondary delays, so lets just say thats another millisecond.\nReception\nNow both transmitted blips have to make it to your receiver. Lets take a sill example. Suppose you are on top of station B. Youll hear station A at the same time station B hears it. Then, when you subtract out the delay for station B, youll hear its blip immediately. You could easily guess you were 372 miles from station A.\nIt is more likely, though, that you will be somewhere else, which complicates things. If you find there is a 372-mile difference in your distance from station A to station B, that could mean you were 186 miles away from each station. Or, you could be 202 miles from station A and 170 miles from station B.\nIf you plot all the possibilities, youll get a hyperbolic curve. You are somewhere on the curve. How do you know where? You take a reading on a different pair of transmitters, and the curves should touch on two points. You are on one of those points.\nThis is similar to stellar navigation, and you usually have enough of an idea where you are to get rid of one of the points as ridiculous. You do, however, have to take into account the motion of your vehicle between readings. If there are multiple secondary stations, that can help since you can get multiple readings without switching to an entirely new pair. The Coast Guard video below explains it graphically, if that helps.\n\nReceiver Tech\nThe receiver was able to inject a rectangular pulse on both channels to use as a reference, which is what the video talks about being the pedestal (although the British typically called it a cursor).\nLORAN could operate up to 700 nautical miles in the day, but nighttime propagation would allow measurements up to 1,400 nautical miles away. Of course, the further away you are, the less accurate the system is.\nDuring the day, things were simple because you typically just got one pulse from each station. But at night, you could get multiple bounces, and it was much more difficult to interpret.\nIf you want to dive really deep into how youd take a practical fix, [The Radar Room] has a very detailed video. It shows multiple pulses and uses a period-appropriate APN-4 receiver.\nIn Care Of\nThe U.S. Army Air Force originated LORAN. The Navy was working on Loran-B, but later gave up on it and took over an Air Force project with similar goals. In 1957, the Coast Guard took over both systems and named them Loran-A and Loran-C and decided they werent acronyms anymore. Loran-A started going away in the mid-1970s, although some overseas systems were active well into the 1990s. Loran-C survived even longer than that.\nOddly, the development of LORAN took place in a radiation laboratory. GPS isnt that different other than having super synchronized clocks, many transmitters, and some very fancy math.\nFeatured Image: Detail of USAF special Loran chart.

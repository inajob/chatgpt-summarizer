Their decline was largely as a result of improvements in CD technology and the rise of the MP3 player, and as a result we live in a world largely absent of this once-ubiquitous technology. There are still a few places where these devices crop up, and thanks to some modern technology their capabilities as a music playback device can be greatly enhanced.\nThe build starts, as one might expect, by disassembling the cassette and removing the magnetic tape from the plastic casing. With the interior of the cassette empty its capable of holding a small battery, USB-C battery charger, and a Bluetooth module. The head of an old tape deck can be wired to the audio output of the Bluetooth module and then put back in place in the housing in place of the old tape. With the cassette casing reassembled, theres nothing left to do but pair it to a smartphone or other music-playing device and push play on the nearest tape deck.\nAs smartphones continue to lose their 3.5 mm headphone jacks, builds like this can keep lots of older stereos relevant and usable again, including for those of us still driving older vehicles that have functioning tape decks. Of course, if youre driving a classic antique auto with a tape technology even older than the compact cassette, there are still a few Bluetooth-enabled options for you as well.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u751f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306f1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306890\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u6d41\u884c\u3057\u3001CD\u3084MP3\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u3067\u8870\u9000\u3002\u6539\u9020\u3067Bluetooth\u518d\u751f\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u751f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Bluetooth\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u6614\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6280\u8853\u9769\u65b0", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aBluetooth\u6539\u9020\u624b\u6cd5"]}

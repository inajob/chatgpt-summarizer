After all, youve taken the time to navigate to Hackaday and read this, rather than ask your favoured LLM to trawl the web and summarize what it finds for you. Perhaps you have no such pro-biological bias, and you just dont know how to set up the stochastic parrot feed. If thats the case, buckle up, because [Rafael Ben-Ari] has an article on how you can replace us with a suite of LLM agents.\nThe AI-focused paper has a more serious aesthetic, but its still seriously retro.\nHe actually has two: a tech news feed, focused on the AI industry, and a retrocomputing paper based on SimCity 2000s internal newspaper. Everything in both those papers is AI-generated; specifically, hes using opencode to manage a whole dogpen of AI agents that serve as both reporters and editors, each in their own little sandbox.\nUsing opencode like this lets him vary the model by agent, potentially handing some tasks to small, locally-run models to save tokens for the more computationally-intensive tasks. It also allows each task to be assigned to a different model if so desired. With the right prompting, you could produce a niche publication with exactly the topics that interest you, and none of the ones that dont.\u00a0 In theory, you could take this toolkit  the implementation of which [Rafael] has shared on GitHub  to replace your daily dose of Hackaday, but we really hope you dont. Wed miss you.\nThats news covered, and weve already seen the weather reported by AI now we just need an agenetic sports section and some AI-generated funny papers.\u00a0 Thatd be the whole newspaper. If only you could trust it.\nStory via reddit.", "title": "- AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765", "body": "AI\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7279\u5316\u578b\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "- LLM\u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30cb\u30c3\u30c1\u306a\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068AI\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5831\u9053\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb"]}

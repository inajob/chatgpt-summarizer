Thats fun and all, but it also makes it easy to crash them into things. This problem inspired [Narrow Studios] to whip up something to offer a bit of protection.\nThe concept is simple enough\u2014the RC car just needs some way to detect obstacles and stop before hitting them. The build relies on ultrasonic sensors as rangefinders to spot solid objects in the path of the vehicle. An Arduino Nano is in charge of reading the sensors. When it appears the car is approaching a wall or similar obstacle, it fires off a PWM signal to the cars motor controller commanding it to brake. The additional hardware is held to the car with a bunch of custom printed brackets.\nThe setup isnt perfect; the video notes that if you insist on accelerating quickly when close to a wall, you still have a fair chance of hitting it. Thats largely put down to the refresh time of the sensors and the overall system, which could be improved with further work. Still, if youre always crashing your RC car into walls or curbs, this kind of thing might appeal to you.\nWeve featured some other great RC projects before, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u885d\u7a81\u56de\u907f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "body": "RC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u885d\u7a81\u9632\u6b62\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u885d\u7a81\u56de\u907f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "- \u300c\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u969c\u5bb3\u7269\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308bRC\u30ab\u30fc\u6539\u9020\u300d", "- \u300cArduino Nano\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d", "- \u300c\u885d\u7a81\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01 RC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u300d", "- \u300c\u3088\u308a\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01 RC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u969c\u5bb3\u7269\u9632\u6b62\u6539\u826f\u300d"]}

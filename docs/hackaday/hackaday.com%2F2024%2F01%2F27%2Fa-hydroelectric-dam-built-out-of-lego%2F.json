But they dont have to be  you can build your own at home, using LEGO, as [Build it with Bricks] demonstrates!\nThe build is set up in an aquarium with a pump, which serves to simulate flow through a river system. The LEGO dam is installed in the middle of the aquarium, blocking the flow. It has a sluice gate in the lower section to feed water to a turbine for power generation. The gate is moved via a rack and pinion. Its driven by a LEGO motor on a long shaft to keep it a safe distance from the wet stuff. The dam also gets a spillway to allow for overflow to be handled elegantly. Meanwhile, a second motor acts as a generator, fitted with a fairly basic turbine.\nHilariously, the first build fails spectacularly as the hydrostatic pressure of the water destroys the LEGO wall. A wider base and some reinforcements help solve the problem. Theres a better turbine, too.\u00a0 Its all pretty leaky, but LEGO was never designed to be water tight. As you might imagine, it doesnt generate a lot of power, but its enough to just barely light some LEDs.\nIts a fun way to learn about hydroelectric power, even if its not making major amounts of electricity. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u30db\u30d3\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u30c0\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6c34\u6d41\u3092\u6a21\u64ec\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30c0\u30e0\u306f\u6c34\u4e2d\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6c34\u306f\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u306b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3055\u308c\u3001\u767a\u96fb\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u767a\u96fb\u91cf\u306f\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u3076\u306e\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5b85\u3067LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6c34\u529b\u30c0\u30e0\u3067\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3082\u767a\u96fb\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u5727\u529b\u306b\u8010\u3048\u308b\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240\u3092LEGO\u3067\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "LEGO\u306e\u6c34\u529b\u30c0\u30e0\u304c\u6c34\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u767a\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046\uff01", "\u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u6c34\u69fd\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080LEGO\u306e\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u6240\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

But they dont have to be  you can build your own at home, using LEGO, as [Build it with Bricks] demonstrates!\nThe build is set up in an aquarium with a pump, which serves to simulate flow through a river system. The LEGO dam is installed in the middle of the aquarium, blocking the flow. It has a sluice gate in the lower section to feed water to a turbine for power generation. The gate is moved via a rack and pinion. Its driven by a LEGO motor on a long shaft to keep it a safe distance from the wet stuff. The dam also gets a spillway to allow for overflow to be handled elegantly. Meanwhile, a second motor acts as a generator, fitted with a fairly basic turbine.\nHilariously, the first build fails spectacularly as the hydrostatic pressure of the water destroys the LEGO wall. A wider base and some reinforcements help solve the problem. Theres a better turbine, too.\u00a0 Its all pretty leaky, but LEGO was never designed to be water tight. As you might imagine, it doesnt generate a lot of power, but its enough to just barely light some LEDs.\nIts a fun way to learn about hydroelectric power, even if its not making major amounts of electricity.

The desire to recreate long-obsolete devices simply because they existed while we were growing up is a curious trait, but one thats powerful enough to drive entire categories of hardware hacking  looking at you, retrocomputing buffs.\nHardware nostalgia isnt all about 6502s and Z80s, though. Even more basic were the electronic toys of the 1970s, such as the Radio Shack 65-in-1 kit that [Tom Thoen] is currently recreating. The 65-in-1 was a breadboarding kit aimed at the budding electrical engineer, with components mounted to colorful cardboard by spring terminals. The included lab manual had circuits that could be quickly assembled using a handful of jumper wires. It was an endlessly fascinating toy that undoubtedly launched many careers, present company included.\nThe original 65-in-1 was $21.95 in 1976, or about $120 today.\nWhile the passage of time may not have dulled [Tom]s memories of his original 65-in-1, technology has marched on, meaning that certain allowances had to be made to create a modern version. He wisely eschews the cardboard for PCBs, one for each of the major component blocks provided in the original, and uses female header connectors in place of the springs. Component choice is tailored for the times; gone are the ferrite rod antenna and variable capacitor of the original, as well as the incandescent lamp, which is replaced by an LED that would have been a significant fraction of the kits $21.95 price back in 1976. Theres no BOM yet, so we cant say for sure if any of the transistors are germanium, but its clear that there arent any of the old TO-1 cans. But dismay not, originalists, for the meter, relay, CdS photocell, and solar battery all made the final cut.\n[Tom] has done some beautiful work here, with more to come. We imagine that 3D printing could be used to recreate some details like the original Morse key and speaker grille. We love the laser-engraved backing board, too, as it captures some of the charm of the originals wooden box. This isnt the only love for the Science Fair brand weve seen lately, either; the nostalgia seems to be contagious."}

In the modern day, if your old iMac even boots, well, you cant do much with it. [Rick Norcross] got a hold of a dead (hopefully irreparable) specimen, and stuffed a modern PC inside of it.\nFrom the outside, its suprizingly hard to tell. Of course the CRT had to go, replaced with a 15 ELO panel that fits well after being de-bezeled. (If its resolution is only 1024 x 768, well, its also only 15, and that pixel density matches the case.) An M-ATX motherboard squeezes right in, above a modular PSU. Cooling comes from a 140 mm case fan placed under the original handle. Of course you cant have an old Mac without a startup chime, and [Rick] obliges by including an Adafruit FX board wired to the internal speakers, set to chime on power-up while the PC components are booting.\nThese sorts of mods have proven controversial in the past certainly theres good reason to want to preserve aging hardwarebut perhaps with this generation of iMac it wont raise the same ire as when someone guts a Mac Classic. Weve seen the same treatment given to a G4 iMac, but somehow the lamp doesnt quite have the same place in our hearts as the redoubtable jellybean."}

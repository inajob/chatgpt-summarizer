Its a dodgy cheapo board with, among other things, TFT display, touchscreen, and ESP32 built-in. You can learn more about the CYD over here: Getting Started with ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display Board \u2013 CYD (ESP32-2432S028R).\nIn this build eight AA batteries are used to deliver 12 volts to operate a solenoid controlling a latch and 5 volts for the microcontroller. The encasing is clear in order to entice players in an escape-room style sitting. The custom software is included down the bottom of the project page and it is also available from arduino.cc, if thats your bag.\nOf course weve done plenty of other ESP32 TFT projects before, such as Piko  Your ESP32 Powered Fitness Buddy and ESP32 Brings New Features To Classic Geiger Circuit."}

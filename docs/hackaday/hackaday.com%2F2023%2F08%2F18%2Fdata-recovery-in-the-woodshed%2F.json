How do you recover the data? If you are like us, you imagine a high-tech lab with serious-looking technicians and engineers. [John Graham-Cumming] managed it in his woodworking shop. Granted, it was a solid-state drive, so a clean room wasnt necessary, but we still found it an unexpected story.\n[Johns] gaming rig had two Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs and decided not to boot. A quick analysis found one of the drives failed  it happens. However, the drive showed some signs of life after cooling off. A 30-minute trip to the freezer made the drive work again until it got warm again.\n\nSuspecting a bad solder joint, [John] applied pressure to the board and got it working. The problem is you dont want to have a death grip on your SSD while you copy a terabyte of data from it. The answer? A woodworking clamp applies pressure in just the right place. Are you worried about excess heat build-up? A carpenters square makes a good heat sink, apparently.\nLike all the best stories, this one had a happy ending with complete data recovery. Even better, a bit of hot air reflow restored the drive to fully working status again.\nOur usual data recovery efforts take more wire than woodworking. Depending on your media, if freezing doesnt work, maybe try an oven.", "title": "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u65e7\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u51b7\u51cd\u5eab\u3067\u6551\u3048\u308b\u58ca\u308c\u305fSSD\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf", "body": "1TB\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u65e7\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002\u51b7\u51cd\u5eab\u3067\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u3067\u6570\u56de\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5727\u529b\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6728\u5de5\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fa9\u65e7\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u3001\u52a0\u71b1\u3067\u518d\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u65e7\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u51b7\u51cd\u5eab\u3067\u6551\u3048\u308b\u58ca\u308c\u305fSSD\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf", "\u6728\u5de5\u4f5c\u696d\u5834\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u65e7\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30e9\u30dc\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u6728\u5de5\u7528\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u6551\u3048\u305f\u58ca\u308c\u305fSSD\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf", "DIY\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5fa9\u65e7\uff01\u6728\u5de5\u7528\u5177\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30ae\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30ab\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\uff01\u51b7\u51cd\u5eab\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3059\u308b\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf"]}

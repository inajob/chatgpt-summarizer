It\u2019s probably the most Hackaday challenge we have run in a long time, and you all delivered! The judging was tight, but in the end three projects rose up to the top, and will each be taking home a $150 DigiKey gift certificate, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t give all of the projects a look.\nSo without further ado, let\u2019s check out the winners and all the others that tickled the hacky regions of our judges\u2019 brains.\nPrize Winners\n[Miroslav Hancar]\u2019s LED Candles was a shoe-in, at least if you watched the video demo. It presents itself as a simple LED on a round PCB with a coin cell, but then when [Miroslav] lights it with an actual lighter, it starts glowing. (And maybe smoking just a little bit.) He makes both single-LED and quad-LED varieties, and they\u2019re both gems.\nThe component misuse is an old favorite: the diode\u2019s forward voltage drop depends on the temperature, and if you measure the voltage across the current-limiting resistor, you can read this voltage and determine when someone is setting fire to your LED. A bonus of the single-LED configuration is that if you touch the LED\u2019s leads, your finger shunts some of the current, and you can \u201csnuff\u201d the LEDs out. And while we\u2019ve seen similar LED hacks before, the addition of actual fire to this one seems to have warmed our judges\u2019 hearts.\n[Luke J. Barker]\u2019s Need an Electrical Slip Ring? is simplicity itself, and appears to have been born of the mother of invention. [Luke] was making a VertiBird helicopter toy, which spins around on the desk and rises and falls with joystick control. And for that, he needed a slip ring. Enter the humble audio jack, which fills the job nicely, transmitting power to the rotating helicopter without twisting up wires in the process. There\u2019s not much magic here, but it\u2019s a fantastic idea when you need something to spin.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, [Craig D]\u2019s Boosting voltage with a cable looks like it shouldn\u2019t work at first, but it does. In most step-up-voltage setups, you\u2019re storing the energy in either a capacitor or inductor, and switching it in and out of the circuit to hop the voltage up. Here, the energy isn\u2019t ever really \u201cstored\u201d as much as it\u2019s \u201cin flight\u201d.\nA circuit sends a pulse down a long length of coaxial cable that is left open at the other end. The pulse reflects off the open end and heads back toward the voltage driver, which then fires off another pulse at just the right time to make the travelling wave a little bit bigger, and this continues. It\u2019s like pushing a swing \u2013 adding a little extra oomph at just the right time can build up. There\u2019s a lot of cool physics here, a nice simulation that actually ends up corresponding very well with reality, and in the end the pulse timing isn\u2019t rocket science, but rather figuring out the resonant frequency along the coax. And it works well enough to light up two neon bulbs in series (~140 V) off of a 15 V power supply.\nHonorable Mentions\nWe got way more cool entries than we have prizes, so we try to round them up into categories and give them a little time in the sun.\nOut of Spec\nNormally, a 555 timer oscillator circuit relies on filling up a capacitor with a current that\u2019s throttled through a resistor. How can you make it go faster? Make the capacitor smaller and the resistor less resistive. What happens when you get rid of them both entirely, relying on stray capacitance and the resistance of whatever wire you\u2019re using? That\u2019s what [MagicWolfi] aimed to find out with his Ludicrous 555 project.\nThe IC-Abusing Diode Tester is an absolutely horrible circuit. Nothing in it works like it should. The only reason the IC doesn\u2019t burn up is that it\u2019s more robust than the datasheet promises, and the battery used has such a high internal resistance that it can\u2019t source that much current anyway. Parts are powered by leakage current, and below their minimum voltage. [Joseph Eoff] counts seven values that are out of spec in this single historical circuit, so that\u2019s gotta count for something.\nJunk Box Substitutions\nYou need GPIO lines, but you have a UART. [Ken Yap] proposes repurposing the DSR, DTR, RTS, and CTS lines as inputs and outputs, and he writes code to make them do his bidding.\nOr maybe you\u2019re working on self-assembling robots and you need some magic glue to hold different modules together. [Miana]\u2019s Low-melt-solder connected robots is half research project, and half hack. Resistors are used to melt solder, magnets align the parts together, and when it all cools down, it\u2019s as if two modules are brazed together. This one\u2019s a lot more than a hack, but we\u2019re honored to have it entered in the contest anyway!\nBizarro World\nWe honestly thought we\u2019d get more entries that made use of the duality of most sensors / emitters. Instead, we got two. [Nick]\u2019s Better Than Bluetooth does the LED-as-photosensor trick, and concludes that it\u2019s better than Bluetooth if expense, limited range, and frustration are what you\u2019re looking for in a data link. Meanwhile, [Kauz] proves that electromagnets are also pickups by building a guitar pickup out of six relays.\nSide Effects\nEverything is a fuse if you run enough current through it. [JohnsonFarms] pushed conductive filament to the melting point, and calibrated it along the way. While roasting a hotdog with mains voltage and a couple forks, [Ian Dunn] discovered that if you stick some LEDs in it, they light up.\nMost old op-amps oscillate out of control when given feedback, unless you damp it down a bit with a capacitor. [Adrian Freed] found an op-amp lousy enough that would do this at audio frequencies, and used it to reimagine a classic noisemaker.\nFinally, while you should probably avoid the metastable middle-zones between digital one and zero, [SHAOS] combines unbuffered NAND and NOR gates to tease out a third logic state. [Bob Widlar] would be proud.\nThanks All!\nAs always, we had more great entries that we could feature here, so head on over to Hackaday.io and check them out. And thanks again to DigiKey for providing our top three with $150 gift certificates. If you\u2019re looking for your chance to show off a project that you\u2019re working on, hang on for a while because we\u2019ll be starting up a new contest in early 2026.\n \n\n\n"}

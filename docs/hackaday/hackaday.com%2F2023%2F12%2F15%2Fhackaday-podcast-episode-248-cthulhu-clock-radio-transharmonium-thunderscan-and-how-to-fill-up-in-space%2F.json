We started with news about Voyager; at T+46 years from launch, any news tends to be bad, and the latest glitch has everyone worried. We also took a look at how close the OSIRIS-REx mission came to ending in disaster, all for want of consistent labels.\nElliot was charmed by a Cthulhu-like musical instrument, while Dan took a shine to a spark gap transmitter thats probably on the FCCs naughty list. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishably from magic, and we looked at the laser made possible by the magician-in-chief himself, C.V. Raman. Why would you stuff a PSU full of iron filings? Probably for the same reason youd print fake markings on a 6502 chip. We also took a look at the chemistry and history of superglue, a paper tape reader that could lop off your arm, and rocket gas stations in space.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\n\nEpisode 248 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nVoyager 1 In Trouble As Engineers Scramble To Debug Issue With Flight Data System\nBoeing 737 Pressurisation (site appears to be down at press time; hopefully it comes back up)\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nGuess the sound for a chance to win a Podcast T-shirt!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nThe Trans-Harmonium Is A Strange Kind Of Radio-Musical Instrument\n\nEmily Francisco  Operations and Maintenance \nSupercon 2022: Chris Combs Reveals His Art-World Compatibility Layer\n\n\nModern Spark Gap Transmitter Uses A Rotary Gap\nHomemade Raman Laser Is Shaken, Not Stirred\n\nRaman laser  Wikipedia\nOpen Source Raman Spectrometer Is Cheaper, But Not Cheap\nTSP #230  A Real-Life Tricorder!

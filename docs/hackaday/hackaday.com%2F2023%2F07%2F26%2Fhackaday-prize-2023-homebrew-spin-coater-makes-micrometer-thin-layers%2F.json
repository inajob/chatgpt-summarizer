We had never given much thought to spin coaters, for example, until we saw [Jeroen Delcour]s neat homebrew example. As it turns out, spin coating has lots of applications in fields like optics, semiconductor manufacturing or even art projects, where a thin, even layer of a material is required on top of a flat substrate.\nThe basic idea behind a spin coater is simple: you dispense a few drops of a solution containing the material to be deposited on top of the thing you want to coat, then spin the thing around at a constant speed. The balance between the centripetal force and the liquids surface tension ensures that the liquid turns into a film with a consistent thickness all across the substrate. The solvent evaporates, and youre left with a nice solid layer just a few microns thick.\n[Jeroen] built his spin coater out of a brushless DC drone motor, a programmable motor controller, and an ESP32. A rotary pushbutton and an OLED form the user interface, allowing the user to select the speed and spin times. The electronics are all mounted inside a laser-cut wooden enclosure, with the motor sticking out the top, surrounded by a 3D-printed splash guard.\nProfessional spin coating equipment typically comes with a vacuum chuck to hold the sample in place, but [Jeroen] wasnt too excited about implementing vacuum systems on a spinning platform and decided instead to simply clamp down the sample using screws in a laser-cut piece of acrylic. This works well enough, and is easy to customize for different sample sizes.\nIn the video embedded below, [Jeroen] experiments with applying a layer of silicone rubber onto a PCB. Spin coating is an essential step when youre making your own semiconductor devices such as solar cells, though you might also need more complicated equipment such as an electron microscope. [Jeroen]s spin coater is at least able to process much larger objects than one we saw earlier.\n\n\n The HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u8584\u819c\u3092\u5747\u7b49\u306b\u5857\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "2023 Hackaday Prize\u306eGearing Up\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u56de\u8ee2\u5857\u5e03\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f8b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u6db2\u4f53\u3092\u5747\u4e00\u306a\u539a\u3055\u306b\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u3066\u8584\u3044\u5c64\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u304c\u3001[Jeroen]\u3055\u3093\u306fDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3001ESP32\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3092\u30cd\u30b8\u3067\u56fa\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u8584\u819c\u3092\u5747\u7b49\u306b\u5857\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "ESP32\u3068\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30b4\u30e0\u306e\u8584\u819c\u3092\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58", "\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u5909\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308bAC\u30ea\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u5857\u5e03\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

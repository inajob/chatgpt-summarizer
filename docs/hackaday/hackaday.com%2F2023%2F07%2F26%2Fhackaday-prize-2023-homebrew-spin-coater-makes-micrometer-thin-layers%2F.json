We had never given much thought to spin coaters, for example, until we saw [Jeroen Delcour]s neat homebrew example. As it turns out, spin coating has lots of applications in fields like optics, semiconductor manufacturing or even art projects, where a thin, even layer of a material is required on top of a flat substrate.\nThe basic idea behind a spin coater is simple: you dispense a few drops of a solution containing the material to be deposited on top of the thing you want to coat, then spin the thing around at a constant speed. The balance between the centripetal force and the liquids surface tension ensures that the liquid turns into a film with a consistent thickness all across the substrate. The solvent evaporates, and youre left with a nice solid layer just a few microns thick.\n[Jeroen] built his spin coater out of a brushless DC drone motor, a programmable motor controller, and an ESP32. A rotary pushbutton and an OLED form the user interface, allowing the user to select the speed and spin times. The electronics are all mounted inside a laser-cut wooden enclosure, with the motor sticking out the top, surrounded by a 3D-printed splash guard.\nProfessional spin coating equipment typically comes with a vacuum chuck to hold the sample in place, but [Jeroen] wasnt too excited about implementing vacuum systems on a spinning platform and decided instead to simply clamp down the sample using screws in a laser-cut piece of acrylic. This works well enough, and is easy to customize for different sample sizes.\nIn the video embedded below, [Jeroen] experiments with applying a layer of silicone rubber onto a PCB. Spin coating is an essential step when youre making your own semiconductor devices such as solar cells, though you might also need more complicated equipment such as an electron microscope. [Jeroen]s spin coater is at least able to process much larger objects than one we saw earlier.\n\n\n The HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As reported by Android Authority, with a series of recently accepted patches this RISC-V support was stripped again from the ACK. While this doesnt mean that Android cannot be made to work on RISC-V, any company interested would have to do all of the heavy lifting themselves, which might include Qualcomm with their recently announced RISC-V-based smartwatch Snapdragon SoC.\nNo reason was provided by Google for this change, and the official statement from Google to Android Authority says that Google is not ready to provide a single supported Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI), but that Android will continue to support RISC-V. This change however, removes RISC-V kernel support from the ACK, and since Google only certifies Android builds which ship with a GKI featuring an ACK, this effectively means that RISC-V is not supported at this point, and likely wont be for the foreseeable future.\nAs discussed on Hacker News, a potential reason might be the very fragmentary nature of the RISC-V ISA, which makes a standard RISC-V kernel very complicated if you want to support more than a (barebones) profile. This is also supported by a RISC-V mailing list thread, where expensive maintenance is mentioned for why Google doesnt want to support RISC-V.", "title": "Android Common Kernel\uff08ACK\uff09\u304b\u3089RISC-V\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u64a4\u56de\u3055\u308c\u308b", "body": "\u53bb\u5e74\u3001Android Common Kernel\uff08ACK\uff09\u3078\u306eRISC-V\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u3001Android\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304cRISC-V ISA\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305fSoC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5e0c\u671b\u306f\u6253\u3061\u7815\u304b\u308c\u305f\u3002Google\u306fACK\u304b\u3089RISC-V\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u524a\u9664\u3057\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306b\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["Android Common Kernel\uff08ACK\uff09\u304b\u3089RISC-V\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u64a4\u56de\u3055\u308c\u308b", "Google\u304cRISC-V\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u518d\u8003\uff1f", "Qualcomm\u306eRISC-V\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1SoC", "Google\u3068RISC-V\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u554f\u984c", "RISC-V\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u3055"]}

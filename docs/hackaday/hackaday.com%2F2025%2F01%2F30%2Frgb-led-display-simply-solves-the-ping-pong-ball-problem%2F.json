Wed like to draw particular attention to one of his construction methods. On the software end of things there are multiple ways to get images onto a DIY RGB panel, but his assembly technique is worth keeping in mind.\nThe diameter of ping pong balls is a mismatch for the spacing of LEDs on a strip. The solution? A bit of force.\nThe technique we want to highlight is not the fact that he used table tennis balls as the diffusers, but rather the particular manner in which he used them. As diffusers, ping-pong balls are economical and theyre effective. But you know what else they are? An inconvenient size!\nAn LED strip with 30 LEDs per meter puts individual LEDs about 33 mm apart. A regulation ping-pong ball is 40 mm in diameter, making them just a wee bit too big to fit nicely. Weve seen projects avoid this problem with modular frames that optimize spacing and layout. But [Brian]s solution was simply to use force.\nObserving that ping-pong balls dont put up much of a fight and the size mismatch was relatively small, he just shoved those (slightly squashy) 40 mm globes into 33 mm spacing. It actually looks perfectly fine!\nWe suspect that this method doesnt scale indefinitely. Probably large displays like this 1200 pixel wall are not the right place to force a square peg into a round hole, but it sure seemed to hit the spot for his poster-sized display. Watch it in action in the video below, or see additional details on the projects GitHub repository.\n\n"}

They made handy rescue or tinkering environments, and they packed in a surprising amount of useful stuff. But a version 1.x kernel was not large in todays context, so how does a floppy Linux fare in 2025? [Action Retro] is here to find out.\nFollowing a guide from GitHub in the video below the break, hes able to get a modern version 6.14 kernel compiled with minimal options, as well as just enough BusyBox to be useful. It boots on a gloriously minimalist 486 setup, and he spends a while trying to refine and add to it, but its evident from the errors he finds along the way that managing dependencies in such a small space is challenging. Even the floppy itself is problematic, as both the drive and the media are now long in the tooth; it takes him a while to find one that works. He promises us more in a future episode, but its clear this is more of an exercise in pushing the envelope than it is in making a useful distro. Floppy Linux was fun back in 1997, but we can tell its more of a curiosity in 2025.\nLinux on a floppy has made it to these pages every few years during most of Hackadays existence, but perhaps instead of pointing you in that direction, its time to toss a wreath into the sea of abandonware with a reminder that the floppy drivers in Linux are now orphaned.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067Linux\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "body": "2025\u5e74\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30afLinux\u306f\u4f9d\u5b58\u95a2\u4fc2\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067Linux\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c2025\u5e74\uff1a\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e486\u6a5f\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eLinux\u300d", "\u300c\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fcLinux\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3068\u4f9d\u5b58\u95a2\u4fc2\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u300d", "\u300c\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u907a\u7523\uff1a1997\u5e74\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fcLinux\u30682025\u5e74\u306e\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\u300d", "\u300c\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u904b\u547d\uff1aLinux\u306e\u8584\u308c\u3086\u304f\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u300d"]}

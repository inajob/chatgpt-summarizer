Reliable and nearly real-time speech recognition is something thats easily within the average hackers reach nowadays.\nWe covered Whisper getting a plain C/C++ implementation which opened the door to running on a variety of platforms and devices. [Macoron] turned whisper.cpp into a Unity binding which served as inspiration for this project, in which [saurabhchalke] turned it into a Quest 3 package. So if you are doing any VR projects in Unity and want reliable speech input with a side order of easy translation, its never been simpler.", "title": "Meta Quest 3\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308bUnity\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8", "body": "Meta Quest 3 VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u307b\u307c\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306b\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u5316\u3059\u308bUnity\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u300cwhisper.unity\u300d\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306eWhisper\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Meta Quest 3\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308bUnity\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8", "\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u5909\u63db\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUnity\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u77ac\u6642\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u8d77\u3053\u3057\uff01", "Whisper\uff1aMeta Quest 3\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u767b\u5834", "Unity\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u97f3\u58f0\u5165\u529b\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3001Meta Quest 3\u3067\u306e\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3010\u65b0\u7740\u60c5\u5831\u3011"]}

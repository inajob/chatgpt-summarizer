This project uses one to provide rapid, small, and inexpensive network-attached storage (NAS) capabilities wherever you happen to go.\nWith an ESP12F board at the heart to provide network connectivity, the small device also hosts a micro SD card slot and a USB-A port to provide power and programming capabilities for the device. Its Arduino-compatible, and creator [tobychui] has provided the firmware source code necessary to bring it up on your network and start serving up files. Originally intended for people to host web services without experience setting up all of the tools needed for it, theres services for storing and streaming music and video over the network as well.\nWhile it includes a lot more functionality than is typically included on a NAS, [tobychui] notes that with a library, something like WebDAV could be added to provide more traditional NAS capabilities. As it stands, though, having networked storage with web hosting capabilities on a PCB with a total cost of around $5 is not something to shy away from. If youre looking for something a little more powerful for your home network, take a look at this ARM-based NAS instead."}

Kicking off this Friday at Arcadia University, JawnCon0x2 promises to be another cant-miss event for anyone with a curious mind that lives within a reasonable distance of the Liberty Bell.\nThe slate of talks leans slightly towards the infosec crowd, but theres really something for everyone on the schedule. Presentations such as Nothing is Safe: An Introduction to Hardware (In)Security and Making the GameTank  A New, Real 8-Bit Game Machine will certainly appeal to those of us who keep a hot soldering iron within arms reach, while Rolling Recon  Tire Prints: Perimeter Intrusion Detection and Remote Shenanigans via Rogue Tire Stem RF and Get More Radio Frequency Curious will certainly appeal to the radio enthusiasts.\n\nSpeaking of which, anyone who wants to make their interest in radio official can sit in on the Saturday study group led by Ed N2XDD Wilson, the Director of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) Hudson Division. After lunch, you can take your exam to become a licensed ham, and still have time to check out the lockpicking demonstrations from the local TOOOL chapter, the Retro Show n Tell area, and rummage through the self-replenishing table of free stuff thats looking for a new home.\nAttendees can also take part in a number of unique challenges and competitions inspired by the shared professional experience of the JawnCon organizers. One of the events will have attendees putting together the fastest Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) broadband connection, as measured by era-appropriate commercial gear. Easy enough with a spool of copper wire, but the trick here is to push the legendary resilience of DSL to the limit by using unusual conductors. Think wet strings and cooked pasta. Theres also a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition that will pit teams against each other as they work their way through customer support tickets at a fictional Internet service provider.\nWe were on the ground for JawnCon in 2024, and even had the good fortune to be present for the inaugural event back in 2023. While it may not have the name recognition of larger East Coast hacker cons, JawnCon is backed by some of the sharpest and most passionate folks weve come across in this community, and were eager to see the event grow in 2025 and beyond."}

Its a clever design that doubles as furniture, with some cool problem-solving along the way. While it might not be your typical hack, repurposing seedling heat mats and working with insulation makes it a neat project for anyone who likes to tinker. Plus, the whole thing cranks out two loaves of sourdough bread each week!\nThe setup includes an 8 watt heat mat, typically used for aquariums or seedlings, and a temperature control box, so no complicated wiring is needed. The entire box is insulated with rigid foam, which makes it energy efficient\u2014once the foam was installed, the heat mat only needed to turn on about a quarter of the time. To give it a more polished look, [LucidScience] hid the raw plywood edges with oak trim, and even added an adjustable vent for moisture control. Pretty slick for something built from basic materials and a few tools!\nWhile this proofing box isn\u2019t a groundbreaking electronics project, it shows how even simple hardware can be repurposed for entirely new applications. The combination of woodworking and basic electronics makes it an approachable project for DIYers looking to stretch their skills. Whether youre into hacking, woodworking, or just love good bread, this build has something for everyone. [LucidScience]\u2019s clear instructions and simple materials make this a great weekend project that can upgrade your baking game.\n\n", "title": "DIY\u8a3c\u660e\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9: \u6728\u5de5\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408", "body": "DIY\u8a3c\u660e\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bb6[LucidScience]\u304c\u6728\u5de5\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u65ad\u71b1\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u7701\u30a8\u30cd\u3067\u3001\u767a\u9175\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3068\u9053\u5177\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8ab0\u3067\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u9031\u306b2\u3064\u306e\u30b5\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u8a3c\u660e\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9: \u6728\u5de5\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u8a3c\u660e\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9: \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "\u90312\u3064\u306e\u767a\u9175\u30d1\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u9069\u7528\u6cd5: \u7a2e\u5b50\u767a\u82bd\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30de\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7528\u9014", "\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u8a3c\u660e\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9: \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u5411\u4e0a"]}

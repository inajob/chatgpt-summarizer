But what about data storage? Its hardly efficient, but if you want to store your files in a ridiculous paper format\u2014theres a way to do that, too!\nQR-Backup was developed by [za3k], and is currently available as a command-line Linux tool only. It takes a file or files, and turns them into a paper backup\u2014a black-and white PDF file full of QR codes thats ready to print. Thats legitimately the whole deal\u2014you run the code, generate the PDF, then print the file. That piece of paper is now your backup.\u00a0Naturally, qr-backup works in reverse, too. You can use a scanner or webcam to recover your files from the printed page.\nCurrently, it achieves a storage density of 3KB/page, and [za3k] says backups of text in the single-digit megabyte range are practical. You can alternatively print smaller, denser codes for up to 130 KB/page.\nIs it something youll ever likely need? No. Is it super neat and kind of funny? Yes, very much so.\nWeve seen some other neat uses for QR codes before, too\u2014like this printer that turns digital menus into paper ones. If youve got your own nifty uses for these attractive squares, let us know!"}

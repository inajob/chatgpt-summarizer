Since the lifts at the local hill closed shortly after schools let out, this was the only practical way for his son to get a few laps in during the week. Its cobbled together from things that [Jeremy] had around the house, and since the original build its sat outside for a few years without much use. Theres been a lot more snow where he lives this year though, so its time for a rebuild.\nThe power source for the rope tow is an old gas-powered snowblower motor, with a set of rollers and pulleys for the rope made out of the back end of a razor scooter. Some polyurethane was poured around the old wheel hub so that the rope would have something to grip onto. The motor needed some sprucing up as well, from carburetor adjustment, fuel tank repairs, and some other pieces of maintenance before it could run again. With that out of the way it could be hoisted back up a tree at the top of the hill and connected to the long rope.\nThis isnt the first time [Jeremy] has had to perform major maintenance on this machine either. Three years ago it needed plenty of work especially around the polyurethane wheel where [Jeremy] also had to machine a new wheel bearing in addition to all the other work that had to go into repairing it that time. From the looks of things though its a big hit with his son who zips right back up the hill after each ski run. Getting to the tops of ski runs with minimal effort has been a challenge of skiers and snowboarders alike for as long as the sport has been around, and weve seen all kinds of unique solutions to that problem over the years."}

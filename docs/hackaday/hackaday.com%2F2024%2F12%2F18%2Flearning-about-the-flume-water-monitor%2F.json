Sometimes, you just have to pull something apart to learn how it works. [Stephen Crosby] found himself doing just that when he got his hands on a Flume water monitor.\n[Stephen] came by the monitor thanks to a city rebate, which lowered the cost of the Flume device. It consists of two main components: a sensor which is strapped to the water meter, and a separate bridge device that receives information from the sensor and delivers it to Flume servers via WiFi. Theres a useful API for customers, and its even able to integrate with a Home Assistant plugin. [Stephen] hoped to learn more about the device so he could scrape raw data himself, without having to rely on Flumes servers.\nThrough his reverse engineering efforts, [Stephen] was able to glean how the system worked. He guides us through the basic components of the battery-powered magnetometer sensor, which senses the motion of metering components in the water meter. He also explains how it communicates with a packet radio module to the main bridge device, and elucidates how he came to decompile the bridges software.\nWhen he sent this one in, [Stephen] mentioned the considerable effort that went into reverse engineering the system was a very poor use of his time  but wed beg to differ. In our book, taking on a new project is always worthwhile if you learned something along the way. Meanwhile, if youve been pulling apart some weird esoteric commercial device, dont hesitate to let us know what you found!"}

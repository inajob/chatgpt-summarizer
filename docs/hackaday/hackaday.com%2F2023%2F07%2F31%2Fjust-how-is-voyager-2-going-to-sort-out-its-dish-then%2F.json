With a satellite dish its a straightforward task to tweak the position, but what happens if the dish in question is out beyond the edge of the Solar System?\nWe told you a few days ago about this exact issue currently facing Voyager 2, but were guessing Hackaday readers will want to know a little bit more about how a 50+ year old spacecraft so far from home can still sort out its antenna. The answer lies in NASA Technical Report 32-1559, Digital Canopus Tracker from 1972, which describes the instrument that notes the position of the star Canopus, which along with that of the Sun it can use to calculate the antenna bearing to reach Earth. The report makes for fascinating reading, as it describes how early-1970s technology was used to spot the star by its specific intensity and then keep it in its sights. Its an extremely accessible design, as even the part numbers are an older version of the familiar 74 logic.\nSo somewhere out there in interstellar space beyond the boundary of the Solar System is a card frame full of 74 logic thats been quietly keeping an eye on a star since the early 1970s, and the engineers from those far-off days at JPL are about to save the bacon of the current generation at NASA with their work. We hope that there are some old guys in Pasadena right now with a spring in their step.\nRead our coverage of the story here."}

We\u2019ve managed to get the ticket price down a bit this year, so you can join in all the fun for $145. And if you\u2019re reading this right now, snap up one of the $75 early bird tickets as fast as you can.\nHackaday Europe is going down again in Berlin this year, on March 15th and 16th at MotionLab. It\u2019s going to be a day and a half of presentations, lightning talks, badge hacking, workshops, and more. This is where Hackaday hangs out in person, and it\u2019s honestly just a great time \u2013 if your idea of a great time is trading favorite PCB design tricks, crafting crufty code, and generally trading tales of hardware derring-do.\nIn short, it\u2019s the best of Hackaday, live and in person. Throughout the weekend, all the meals are catered, we\u2019ve got live music at night, and the soldering irons will be warmed up for you. It\u2019s going to be great!\nIf you\u2019re in town on Friday the 14th, we\u2019ll be meeting up in the evening to get together over some pre-event food and drink, sponsored by Crowd Supply. It\u2019s a nice opportunity to break the ice, get to know the people you\u2019re going to be spending the next 48 hours with, and just mingle without missing that great talk or wonderful workshop.\nThe Badge\nThe badge is a showpiece of SAOs \u2013 the simple add-ons that we were cheekily calling \u201cSupercon Add Ons\u201d a couple months ago. For Supercon, we just exposed the I2C busses and GPIOs, flashed Micropython on the thing, and let you go wild. For Europe, the badge is going to have re-vamped firmware, and the range of SAOs that we\u2019re including in the bag has gone bonkers.\nYou see, we held this Supercon Add-On Contest, and the winners were insane. Plus, we\u2019ve got the Supercon-issue touch wheel, LED spiral, and CH32V003 prototyping boards. Did we mention that the badge can flash them through the SAO port?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t encourage you to take the step into making your own SAO to bring and trade with others. An SAO doesn\u2019t have to be complicated to be cool. Just a good idea, and some time spent designing a PCB, getting it fabricated, assembling it, programming it, maybe debugging it, perhaps making a jig and some tooling to help you with the short production run\u2026 OK, who are we kidding? It\u2019s a low-stakes, lighthearted look at the full-stack of hardware creation. Pick a meme, or do something unique, and get a small batch made. The experience is worth even more than the smiles you\u2019ll put on all of our faces.\nCFP Extended\nProcrastineers, rejoice! Today marks the official end of the call for proposals, but since we always do, we\u2019re extending it a bit. If you\u2019ve been thinking about giving a talk, and just never reached activation energy, it\u2019s now or never! Draft up an abstract and get it in before the clock strikes metaphorical midnight on Friday.\nEveryone Can Participate\nBut it\u2019s not just speakers who can bring something to show off at Hackaday Europe 2025. We\u2019ve got lightning talks going on Sunday morning after brunch and before the badge hack showcase. The whole event is an informal show-and-tell anyway, because people always bring whatever they\u2019re working on, or have just finished, to demo to a like-minded crowd. And on that note, if you want to bring something that\u2019s cool but takes up more space than a breadbox, let us know by sending an e-mail to editor@Hackaday.com with [Hackaday Europe] in the subject line. We\u2019ll try to find space for you.\nBut to join in, you\u2019ve got to be there.

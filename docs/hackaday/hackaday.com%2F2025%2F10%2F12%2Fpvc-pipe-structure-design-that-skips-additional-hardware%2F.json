CINTRE (French, English coverage article here) is his collection of joint designs, with examples of how they can be worked into a variety of structures.\nBasic joints have many different applications.\nPVC pipe is inexpensive, widely available, and can often be salvaged in useful quantities even in disaster areas because of its wide use in plumbing and as conduits in construction. It can be cut with simple tools, and once softened with heat, it can be re-formed easily.\nWhat is really clever about [Baptiste]s designs is that there is little need for external fasteners or hardware. Cable ties are all thats required to provide the structural element of many things. Two sawhorse-like assemblies, combined with a flat surface, make up a table, for example.\n\nSoda bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are also common salvage and can be used as surprisingly sturdy heat-shrink and even turned into twine or rope; perhaps that could be an option if one doesnt even have access to cable ties."}

As he rightfully points out, the average resin printer user will just cure a print by putting it in the sunshine or in a curing station that rotates the part in front of some UV lights. This theoretically should cause these photosensitive resins to fully cure, but as the referenced Formlabs documentation and their Form Cure station indicate, theres definitely a thermal element to it as well.\nTo test the impact of temperature during the UV curing process, the test parts were put into an oven along with the UV lamp. Following this uncured, ambient cured and parts cured at 40 to 80 \u00baC were exposed to both tensile strength tests as well as impact strength. The best results came from the Siraya Tech Blu resin cured at 80 \u00baC, with it even giving FDM-printed parts a run for their money, as the following graphs make clear. This shows the value of thermal post-curing, as it anneals the resin prints. This reduces their impact strength somewhat, but massively improves their tensile strength.\n\nAn interesting data point is also that not only does thermal post-curing work during the exposure to the UV source, but also afterwards, even if you lose a few points in the tensile strength test. Although these results are just for this one type of resin, its possible that heating the resin prints while UV curing may universally benefit resin prints. This would surely make for a fascinating follow-up study.\nCredit: CNC Kitchen\nCredit: CNC Kitchen\n", "title": "UV\u786c\u5316\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c", "body": "[Stefan]\u3055\u3093\u304c\u3001\u6a39\u81023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u58ca\u308c\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u6255\u62ed\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3001\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3068\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u71b1\u5f8c\u786c\u5316\u304c\u6a39\u8102\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3057\u305f\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["UV\u786c\u5316\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c", "\u71b1\u5f8c\u786c\u5316\u304c\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3067\u89e3\u304d\u660e\u304b\u3059\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6027\u8cea", "\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u71b1\u5f8c\u786c\u5316\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u52b9\u679c", "UV\u5149\u6e90\u4e0b\u3067\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u52a0\u71b1\u304c\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u53ca\u307c\u3059\u5f71\u97ff\u306e\u691c\u8a3c"]}

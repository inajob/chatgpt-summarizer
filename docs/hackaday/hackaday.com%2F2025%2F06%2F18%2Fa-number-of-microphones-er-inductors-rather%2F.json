He charged a lot of money for putting a chalk X in the spot that needed repair. When [Ford] asked for an itemization, the bill read $1 for the chalk, and the balance for knowing where to draw the X. With todays PCB layout tools, it seems easy to put components down on a board. But, as [Kasyan TV] points out in the video below, you still have to know where to put them.\nThe subject components are inductors, which are particularly picky about placement, especially if you have multiple inductors. After all, inductors affect one another  thats how transformers work. So there are definite rules about good and bad ways to put a few inductors on a board.\n\nHowever, in the video, air-core coils go through several orientations to see which configuration has the most and least interference. Using a ferrite core showed similar results. The final examples use toroids and shielded inductors.\nOne reason ferrite toroids are popular in radio designs is that coils made this way are largely self-shielding. This makes placement easier and means you dont need metal cans to shield the inductors. How much do they shield? The orientation makes a little difference, but not by much. It is more important to give them a little space between the coils. Shields work, too, but note that they also change the inductance value.\nWhile we like the idea of grabbing a breadboard and a scope to measure things, we want to point out that you can also simulate. If you didnt understand the title, you probably dont listen to Propellerheads.\n"}

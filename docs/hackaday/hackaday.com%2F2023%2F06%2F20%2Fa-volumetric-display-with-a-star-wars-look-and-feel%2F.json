Sounds simple enough, but there are a lot of clever details in this build. The main component is a lightly modified LCD projector, a DLP-based machine with an RGB color wheel. By removing the color wheel from the projectors optical path and hooking its sync sensor up to the control electronics, [Mac] is able to increase the framerate of the display, at the cost of color, of course. Other optical elements include a mirror to direct the projected images upwards, and a shutter harvested from an old pair of 3D TV glasses.\nFor the screen, heres where [Mac]s design got really clever. Using a pair of 3D-printed compliant mechanisms, the motion from a pair of voice coils harvested from old speakers drives a trans2lucent screen across a vertical distance of about 25 mm. Driven with a sine wave of about 30 Hz, the images from the projector can be synced up to display twelve separate layers across the swept volume. It might seem like a very shallow display, but it looks deeper in the videos below.\n[Mac] also put a ton of work into the toolchain to get STL models sliced into images and mapped onto the various layers of the display. As for the Star Wars part, thats pretty much all about the enclosure, and we think [Mac] pretty much nailed it. As he admits himself, a lot of it is just greebling, but the details really sell it. Disguising the USB connection as a mechanical data port was a nice touch, and the weathering and wearing effects work well, too.\nWeve seen similar displays before, but the whole combination of clever mechanism, extensive toolchain, and stylish enclosure makes for a nice presentation on this one.\n\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4f53\u7a4d\u8868\u793a\u88c5\u7f6e\uff01", "body": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305fObjet d'Art\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306eVolumetric Display\u3002Maker Mac\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u62e1\u5927\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u56fa\u4f53\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3001SKF\u793e\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308bcompliant mechanism\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001LCD\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u3001\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u3084\u53e4\u30443D\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u304b\u3089\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4f53\u7a4d\u8868\u793a\u88c5\u7f6e\uff01", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u8868\u793a\u6a5f\uff01", "\u58f0\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\uff01", "STL\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3068\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3002", "\u98a8\u5316\u52b9\u679c\u3084\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7cbe\u5de7\u306a\u4f5c\u308a\u3067\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\uff01"]}

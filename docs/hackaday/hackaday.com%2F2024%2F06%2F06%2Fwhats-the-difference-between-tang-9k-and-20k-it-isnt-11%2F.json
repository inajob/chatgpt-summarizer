They are inexpensive, and he noticed there is a 20K version, so he picked one up. Of course, youd expect the 20K board has a different FPGA with more gates than the 9K, but there are also a number of differences in the host board. [Grug] was kind enough to document the differences in the video below.\nIn addition to the differences, theres a good demo of the boards hosting a system-on-chip design. The little DIP package is handy for breadboarding. All of the 20K pins are 3.3 V, according to the documentation. The 9K does have some 1.8 V pins. There are more external devices on the 20K board but that eats up more uncommitted pins. Depending on your design, that may or may not be a problem.\nWe keep meaning to pick some of these up to play with. The Verilog is easy enough, and the tools look adequate. If you need a refresher on Verilog, we have a boot camp for you that would probably port easily enough to the Tang system. Weve been following [Grugs] work on these chips lately, and you should, too.\n\n", "title": "Tang Nano 9K FPGA\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306820K\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "Grug Huhler\u306fTang Nano 9K FPGA\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e20K\u7248\u306b\u3082\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5206\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4e21\u8005\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a18\u9332\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3082\u3042\u308a\u300120K\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3088\u308a\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u3082\u9055\u3044\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Tang Nano 9K FPGA\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306820K\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30aa\u30f3\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30c7\u30e2", "Tang FPGA\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306eVerilog\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0", "20K\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5916\u90e8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u642d\u8f09", "Tang FPGA\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

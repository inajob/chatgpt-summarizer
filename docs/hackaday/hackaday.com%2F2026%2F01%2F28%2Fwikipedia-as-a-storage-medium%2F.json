This must be why [MadAvidCoder] has taken a different approach to storage, placing files as multiple encoded pieces of metadata in Wikipedia edits.\nThe project takes a file, compresses it, and spits out small innocuous strings. These are placed in the comments for Wikipedia edits  which they are at pains to stress  were all legitimate edits in the test cases. The strings can then be retrieved at will and reconstituted, for later use. The test files are a small bitmap of a banana, and a short audio file.\nIts an interesting technique, though fortunately one thats unlikely to be practical beyond a little amusement at the encyclopedias expense. We probably all have our favorite examples of low quality Wikipedia content, so perhaps its fortunate that these are hidden in the edit history rather than the pages themselves. Meanwhile were reminded of the equally impractical PingFS, using network pings as a file system medium."}

But as capable as the hardware and software of a modern smartphone may be, theres still plenty of reasons you may want a real camera to go along with it. The larger sensor, advanced controls, and selection of lenses that youll get with even a relatively cheap camera opens up a world of artistic possibilities.\nIf youre really into chasing that perfect shot, you can even build your own digital camera these days. This design from [Jacob Cunningham] may not be able to go shot-for-shot against a Canon or Nikon in its current state, but we think youll agree theres a lot of potential here  especially for something pieced together with modular components and perfboard.\nInside the 3D printed enclosure is a Raspberry Pi Zero, a Pi HQ Camera module, an 1.5 OLED display, a lithium-ion battery pouch cell, and the charging and voltage regulation boards necessary to keep everything powered up. Theres also a handful of tactile buttons to work through the settings and menus, and a 10-axis IMU to help you keep your horizon level.\n[Jacob] figures the whole thing comes in at around at $185.00, though naturally that number could go up or down considerably depending on what youve already got in the parts bin and what kind of lenses you add to the mix.\nThe hardware side of things looks more or less complete, at least for a first version, and [Jacob] has provided everything youll need to build one of your own. But the software is still a work in progress, with the latest push to the Python code in the projects GitHub repository just eight hours old at the time of this writing. If youve been looking for a DIY camera project to really sink your teeth into, this could provide a great starting point.\nIf youre more interested in moving pictures, we recently covered the CinePi project, which aims to develop an open source cinema-quality camera that you wont need studio backing to afford.\n\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3082\u95a2\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u672c\u7269\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u305f\u30445\u3064\u306e\u7406\u7531", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3044\u5199\u771f\u304c\u64ae\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u672c\u683c\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3082\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002[Raspberry Pi Zero]\u3068\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b8c\u6210\u54c1\u306f\u7d04$185\u3002\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3082\u95a2\u308f\u3089\u305a\u3001\u672c\u7269\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u305f\u30445\u3064\u306e\u7406\u7531", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u5199\u771f\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u624b\u306e\u5c4a\u304f\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "DIY\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u306a\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

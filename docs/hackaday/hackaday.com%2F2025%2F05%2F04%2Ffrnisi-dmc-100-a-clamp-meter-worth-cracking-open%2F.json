In a recent teardown by [Kerry Wong], the new Fnirsi DMC-100 proves that affordable doesnt mean boring. This 10,000-count clamp meter strays from the classic rotary dial in favour of a fully button-based interface  a choice thats got sparks flying in the comments. And yes, it even auto-resumes its last function after reboot, like it knows youre busy frying other fish.\nWhat sets this meter apart isnt just its snappy interface or surprisingly nice gold-tipped probes. Its the layered UX  a hackable interface where short- and long-presses unlock hidden menus, memory functions, and even a graphing mode. A proper hold-my-beer moment comes when you discover it can split-display voltage and current and calculate real-time power (albeit with a minor asterisk: apparent power only, no power factor). Despite a few quirks, like accidentally triggering the flashlight when squeezing the jaw, it holds up well in accuracy tests. Even at higher currents where budget meters usually wobble.\n\n", "title": "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01Fnirsi DMC-100\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Fnirsi DMC-100\u306f\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u5f0f\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u96a0\u3057\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5145\u5b9f\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01Fnirsi DMC-100\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u5f0f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u65b0\u767b\u5834\uff1aDMC-100\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- \u96a0\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff01DMC-100\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUX", "- \u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3092\u7dad\u6301\uff1aDMC-100\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "- \u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u4e21\u7acb\uff01\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316"]}

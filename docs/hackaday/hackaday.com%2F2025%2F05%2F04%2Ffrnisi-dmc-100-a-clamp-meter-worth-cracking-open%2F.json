In a recent teardown by [Kerry Wong], the new Fnirsi DMC-100 proves that affordable doesnt mean boring. This 10,000-count clamp meter strays from the classic rotary dial in favour of a fully button-based interface  a choice thats got sparks flying in the comments. And yes, it even auto-resumes its last function after reboot, like it knows youre busy frying other fish.\nWhat sets this meter apart isnt just its snappy interface or surprisingly nice gold-tipped probes. Its the layered UX  a hackable interface where short- and long-presses unlock hidden menus, memory functions, and even a graphing mode. A proper hold-my-beer moment comes when you discover it can split-display voltage and current and calculate real-time power (albeit with a minor asterisk: apparent power only, no power factor). Despite a few quirks, like accidentally triggering the flashlight when squeezing the jaw, it holds up well in accuracy tests. Even at higher currents where budget meters usually wobble.\n\n"}

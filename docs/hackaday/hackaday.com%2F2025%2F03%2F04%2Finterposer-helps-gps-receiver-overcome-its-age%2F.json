This time, the problems more complicated, but the solution remains the same  hardware hacking. If you recall, the previous frontier was active antenna voltage compatibility  now, its rollover. See, the GPS receiver chip has its internal rollover date set to 18th of September 2022. Weve passed this date a while back, but the receivers firmware isnt new enough to know how to handle this. What to do? Build an interposer, of course.\nYou can bring the by sending some extra init commands to the GPS chipset during bootup, and, firmware hacking just wasnt the route. An RP2040 board, a custom PCB, a few semi-bespoke connectors, and a few zero-ohm resistors was all it took to make this work. From there, a MITM firmware wakes up, sends the extra commands during power-on, and passes all the other traffic right through  the system suspects nothing.\nEverything is open-source, as we could expect. The problems been solved, and, as a bonus, this implant gives a workaround path for any future bugs we might encounter as far as GPS chipset-to-receiver comms are concerned. Now, the revived S200 serves [Tom] in his hacking journeys, and were reminded that interposers remain a viable way to work around firmware bugs. Also, if the firmware (or the CPU) is way too old to work with, an interposer is a great first step to removing it out of the equation completely.", "title": "GPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "GPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3092\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["GPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "RP2040\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067GPS\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u3044GPS\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308bGPS\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u5bfe\u5fdc", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01GPS\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

Its not so much the fuzzy picture or the tracking issues we miss, but the physical experience the physical medium brought to movie night. To recreate that magic, [Dillan] made a Modern VHS with NFC and ESPHome.\nNFC tags are contained in handsomely designed 3D printed cartridges. You can tell [Dillan] put quite a bit of thought into the industrial design of these: theres something delightfully Atari-like about them, but they have the correct aspect ratio to hold a miniaturized movie poster as a label. Theyre designed to print in two pieces (no plastic wasted on supports) and snap together without glue. The printed reader is equally well thought out, with print-in-place springs for that all important analog clunk.\nElectronically, the reader is almost as simple as the cartridge: it holds the NFC reader board and an ESP32. This is very similar to NFC-based audio players weve featured before, but it differs in the programming. Here, the ESP32 does nothing related directly to playing media: it is simply programmed to forward the NFC tag id to ESPHome. Based on that tag ID, ESPHome can turn on the TV, cue the appropriate media from a Plex server (or elsewhere), or do well, literally anything. Its ESPHome; if you wanted to make this and have a cartridge to start your coffee maker, you could.\nIf this tickles your nostalgia bone, [Dillan] has links to all the code, 3D files and even the label templates on his site. If youre not sold yet, check out the video below and you might just change your mind. Weve seen hacks from The Stock Pot before, everything from a rebuilt lamp to an elegant downspout and a universal remote.\n\n", "title": "- NFC\u3068ESPHome\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8VHS\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "[Dillan Stock]\u304cNFC\u3068ESPHome\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eVHS\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u611f\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u9023\u643a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- NFC\u3068ESPHome\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8VHS\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aVHS\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6620\u753b\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc", "- \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306eVHS\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

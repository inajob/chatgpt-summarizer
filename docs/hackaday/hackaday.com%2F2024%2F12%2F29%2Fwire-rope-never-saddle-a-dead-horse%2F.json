Multistrand steel wire used as antenna guy wires, bridge supports, and plenty of other uses.\u00a0 The [HowNot2] team tested an old rule of thumb for wire rope. Never saddle a dead horse.\nClick through the break for more:\n\n\nThe old saying refers to the clips used on wire rope. These clips have a saddle, and u shaped bolt. As the diagram shows, the saddle side of hte bolt should always go on the live (loaded) end of the cable, not the dead (cut) end.\u00a0 This is because the saddle has teeth to grip the cable, and protects it from crimping and damage over time.\n[HowNot2] tests a number of different wire rope clamps  including improper installation.\u00a0 The best clamps are hydraulically crimped connectors. These require some expensive tooling  which is worth if when your life depends on the connection.\nWhen testing got to the u-clips, saddling the live side went fine. When saddling the dead horse, the pull test failed sooner, after emitting some sounds that would but fear in the heart of anyone whos been around heavy equipment or cranes. The adage turns out to be true  never saddle a dead horse.\nIf you really want to know more about wire rope rigging, the US Navy has you covered.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\u3068\u5b9f\u8df5   ", "body": "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u306b\u306f\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u8ca0\u8377\u5074\u306b\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30c1\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\u3068\u5b9f\u8df5   ", "- \u300c\u6b7b\u99ac\u306b\u978d\u3092\u7f6e\u304f\u306a\u300d\u306e\u610f\u5473\u3068\u306f   ", "- \u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u6700\u9069\u306a\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u65b9  ", "- \u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u7d50\u675f\u6cd5\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c  ", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3084\u6a4b\u6881\u652f\u67f1\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027  "]}

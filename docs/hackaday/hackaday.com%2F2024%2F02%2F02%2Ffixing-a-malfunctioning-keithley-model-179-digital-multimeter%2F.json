This something ended up being a\u00a0 certified classic: a Keithley Model 179 digital multimeter from 1978. Listed as non-functional, the unit arrived at his door for less than $50. There werent any exciting pops or smoke when he powered it on, but the display seemed to be showing nothing but random nonsense.\nThe meter has a convenient calibration sequence printed on its electrostatic shield cover and a deadly exposed AC line fuse in the upper left part of the photo.\nUltimately reviving this little piece of history was quite simple, with the main issue turning out to be a dodgy inter-board connector between the main and display boards. After admiring an old repair attempt made on the component, he removed both the male and female connectors, replacing them with new ones.\nThis uncovered issues with the PCB, as the FR4 material and the traces on it had begun to delaminate, probably due to the old adhesive giving up due to age. With pretty low trace density this wasnt anything that a bit of care couldnt work around, fortunately.\nBefore finding this dodgy connector, [Steven] first tried to clean the front mechanical connectors, which took multiple sessions. This was followed up by oiling the mechanism. With the connector fixed and some cleaning, the meters display now read correctly. It still has some issues with starting up though, which [Steven] reckons are due to the old capacitors in the device.\nPresumably some recapping will round off this fun device revival experience, but for the time being a Keithley Model 179 has been saved from e-waste, to inspire generations to come.", "title": "1978\u5e74\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u4fee\u5fa9", "body": "1978\u5e74\u88fd\u306eKeithley Model 179\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3002\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u57fa\u677f\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3066\u8868\u793a\u304c\u4fee\u5fa9\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u8d77\u52d5\u306b\u554f\u984c\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["1978\u5e74\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u4fee\u5fa9", "eBay\u3067\u5165\u624b\u3057\u305f\u6545\u969c\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u624b\u9806", "\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u9593\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u4fee\u6b63\u3057\u3066\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5fa9\u65e7", "PCB\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3066\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9", "\u53e4\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8d77\u52d5\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f"]}

Now, its something which can be done with a commodity microcontroller, as [Atomic14] shows us with the ESP32-TV that plays both video and sound. Even with modern silicon its still somewhat pushing the envelope.\nAs he explains in the video below the break, not all formats are simple enough to be decoded on the fly by a microcontroller. But he finds an AVI file to be within its capabilities which can be created with a bit of ffmpeg wizardry. The board is a fairly standard ESP32 device with an I2C bus, and the video stream isnt too fast for this meager interface. Youll maybe recognize the Muppets clip, but its possible that the early-80s BBC comedy staple The Young Ones might have passed you by if youre not British.\nWe think this code is likely to be of use in quite a few projects, and it would be great to see it further refined. Small video players for not a lot of money can never be a bad thing.\nPrevious ESP32 video projects which have appeared on these pages have been more likely to involve driving a display directly.\n\n"}

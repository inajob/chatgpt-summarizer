The desire was to print a crystal-like case for an ESP32 project, reminiscent of so many glorious game consoles and other transparent hardware of the 1990s. However, with 3D printing the only realistic option on offer, it seemed difficult to achieve a nice visual result. The solution? Custom G-code to produce as nice a print as possible, by having the hot end trace a single continuous path.\nThe first job was to pick a filament. Transparent PLA didnt look great, and was easily dented\u2014something [porchlogic] didnt like given the device was intended to be pocketable. PETG promised better results, but stringing was common and tended to reduce the visual appeal. The solution to avoid stringing would be to stop the hot end lifting away from the print and moving to different areas of the part. Thus, [porchlogic] had to find a way to make the hot end move in a single continuous path\u2014something that isnt exactly a regular feature of common 3D printing slicer utilities.\nThe enclosure itself was designed from the ground up to enable this method of printing. Rhino and Grasshopper were used to create the enclosure and generate the custom G-code for an all-continuous print. Or, almost\u2014there is a single hop across the USB port opening, which creates a small blob of plastic that is easy to remove once the print is done, along with strings coming off the start and end points of the print.\nDesigning an enclosure in this way isnt easy, per se, but it did net [porchLogic] the results desired. Weve seen some other neat hacks in this vein before, too, like using innovative non-planar infill techniques to improve the strength of prints.\n\n\nThanks to [Uxorious] and [Keith Olson] for the tip!"}

Things like the ZIP disk, RDRAM, the digital compact cassette, or even Nintendos VirtualBoy. Going even further back in time [smbaker] is taking a look a bubble memory, a technology that was so fast and cost-effective for its time that it could have been used as universal memory, combining storage and random-access memory into a single unit, but eventually other technological developments overshadowed its quirks.\n[smbaker] is placing his magnetic bubble memory module to work in a Heathkit H8, an Intel 8080-based microcomputer from the the late 70s. The video goes into great detail on the theory of how these devices used moving bubbles of magnetism to store information and how these specific devices work before demonstrating the design and construction of a dedicated support card which hosts the module itself along with all of the necessary circuitry to allow it to communicate with the computer. From there he demonstrates booting the device using the bubble memory and performs several write and read actions using the module as a demonstration.\nEventually other technologies such as solid-state RAM and various hard disk drives caused the obsolescence of this technology, but it did hang on for a bit longer in industrial settings due to its ability to handle high vibrations and mechanical shocks, mostly thanks to the fact that they had no moving parts. Eventually things like Flash memory came around to put the final nail in the coffin for these types of memory modules, though. The Heathkit H8 is still a popular computer for retrocomputing enthusiasts nonetheless, and weve seen all kinds of different memory modules put to work in computers like these.\n\n", "title": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306f\uff1f1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306f\u901f\u304f\u8cbb\u7528\u5bfe\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u308a\u5f97\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u56de\u3001smbaker\u306fHeathkit H8\u306b\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u767b\u5834\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5ec3\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001Heathkit H8\u306f\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u9593\u3067\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306f\uff1f1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u6210\u529f\u6280\u8853\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3002\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u8870\u9000\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3084\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3046\uff1f\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u9055\u3046\u306e\u304b", "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff011970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHeathkit H8\u300d", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3082\u6b21\u3005\u306b\u6d88\u3048\u305f\uff1f\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

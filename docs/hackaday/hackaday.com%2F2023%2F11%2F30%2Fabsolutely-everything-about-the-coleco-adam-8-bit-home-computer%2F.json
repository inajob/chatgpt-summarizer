Theres a monstrous 4-hour deep dive video (see the video description for a comprehensive chapter index) that makes a fantastic reference for anyone wanting to see the Coleco Adam and all of its features in action, in the context of 8-bit home computing in the 80s.\n[Image by Akbkuku, CC BY 4.0]The Adam aimed to be an all-in-one computer package, targeting a family audience for both education and gaming purposes, with a price target around $600, a pretty compelling pitch.\nThe video is a serious in-depth look at the Adam, providing practical demonstrations of everything in various scenarios. This includes showcasing commercials from the period, detailing the systems specs and history, explaining the Adams appeal, discussing specific features, comparing advertisement promises to real costs, and giving a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the system. All of the talk notes are available as well, providing a great companion to the chapter index.\nManufactured by the same Coleco responsible for the ColecoVision gaming console, the Adam had great specs, a great price, and a compelling array of features. Sadly, it was let down badly at launch and Coleco never recovered. However, the Adam remains of interest in the retrocomputing scene and weve even seen more than one effort to convert the Adams keyboard to USB.\n\n", "title": "\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\uff01", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eColeco Adam\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4ed5\u69d8\u3084\u6b74\u53f2\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u304c\u5b9f\u6f14\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u300180\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\uff01", "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300c\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u5411\u3051\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300c\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u300c\u30b3\u30ec\u30b3\u30a2\u30c0\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

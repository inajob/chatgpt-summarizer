Case in point: [dereksgc] is tearing apart a 20 GHz low-noise block (LNB). An LNB is a downconverter, and this one is used for some Irish satellite TV services.\nThe scale of everything matters when your wavelength is only 15 mm. The PCB is small and neatly laid out. There are two waveguides printed on the board, each feeding essentially identical parts of the PCB. Printed filters use little patterns on the board that have particular inductance and capacitance  no need for any components. Try doing that at 2 MHz!\nThe LNB is a single-band unit, so it only needs to worry about the two polarizations. However, [dereksgc] shows that some have multiple bands, which makes everything more complex. He also mentions that this LNB doesnt use a PLL, and hed like to find a replacement at this frequency that is a bit more modern.\nAfter the teardown, it is time to test the device to see how it works. If you want to experiment at this frequency, you need special techniques. For example, weve seen people try to push solderless breadboards this high (spoiler: it isnt easy). Maybe thats why many people settle for modifying existing LNBs like this one.\n\n", "title": "- 20GHz\u306e\u4f4e\u96d1\u97f3\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\uff08LNB\uff09\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u89e3\u5256", "body": "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2RF\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306b\u306a\u308a\u300120GHz\u306e\u4f4e\u96d1\u97f3\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u89e3\u4f53\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7279\u6027\u3084\u6e2c\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 20GHz\u306e\u4f4e\u96d1\u97f3\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\uff08LNB\uff09\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u89e3\u5256", "- \u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2RF\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5316", "- \u5c0f\u578bPCB\u3068\u5370\u5237\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b", "- LNB\u306e\u8907\u6570\u5e2f\u57df\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "- \u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7279\u6b8a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

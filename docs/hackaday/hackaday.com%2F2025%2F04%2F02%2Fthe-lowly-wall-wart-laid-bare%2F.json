Youve probably cracked one open yourself, and even if you havent, youve likely got a pretty good idea of whats inside that sealed up brick of plastic. But sometimes a teardown can be just as much about the journey as it is the end result.\nTruth be told, were not 100% sure if this teardown from [Brian Dipert] over at EDN was meant as an April Fools joke or not. Certainly it was posted on the right day, but the style is close enough to some of his previous work that its hard to say. In any event, hes created a visual feast  never in history has an AC/DC adapter been photographed so completely and tastefully.\nAn Ode to the Diode\n[Brian] even goes so far as to include images of the 2.5 lb sledgehammer and paint scraper that he uses to brutally break open the ultrasonic-welded enclosure. The dichotomy between the thoughtful imagery and the savage way [Brian] breaks the device open only adds to the surreal nature of the piece. Truly, the whole thing seems like it should be part of some avant garde installation in SoHo.\nAfter hes presented more than 20 images of the exterior of the broken wall wart, [Brian] finally gets to looking at the internals. Theres really not much to look at, theres a few circuit diagrams and an explanation of the theory behind these unregulated power supplies, and then the write-up comes to a close as abruptly as it started.\nSo does it raise the simple teardown to an art form? Were not sure, but we know that well never look at a power adapter in quite the same way again.", "title": "- \u58c1\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u305fAC/DC\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "\u58c1\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u5f0f\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u8a18\u4e8b\u304c\u65ac\u65b0\u3067\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u7684\u306a\u8996\u70b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u58c1\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u305fAC/DC\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u5206\u89e3", "- \u5206\u89e3\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3078\uff1aAC\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u58c1\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u610f\u5916\u306a\u65c5", "- \u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u5206\u89e3\u306e\u610f\u7fa9\uff1a\u6a5f\u68b0\u3068\u7f8e\u306e\u878d\u5408"]}

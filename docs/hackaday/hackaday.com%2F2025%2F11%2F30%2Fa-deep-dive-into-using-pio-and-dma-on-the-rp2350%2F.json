Both microcontrollers include a feature known as Programmed I/O (PIO), which lets you configure tiny state machines and other facilities (shift registers, scratch registers, FIFO buffers, etc) to process simple I/O logic, freeing up the CPU to do other tasks.\nThe bottom line is that you can write very simple programs to do very fast and efficient I/O and these programs can run separately to the other code running on your micro. In the video below, [piers] explains how it works and how hes used it in his One ROM project.\nThis is the latest installment from [piers rocks] whose One ROM project weve been tracking since July this year when we first heard about it. Since then weve been watching this project grow up and we were there when it was only implemented on the STM32F4, when it was renamed to One ROM, and when it got its USB stack. Along the way [piers rocks] was on FLOSS Weekly Episode 850: One ROM To Rule Them All too.\nHave you seen PIO being put to good use in other projects? Let us know in the comments, or on the tips line!\n\n", "title": "- RP2040/RP2350\u306ePIO\u3068DMA\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u51e6\u7406", "body": "RP2040/RP2350\u306ePIO\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001CPU\u4ecb\u5165\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u51e6\u7406\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4f8b\u306f\u300cOne ROM\u300d\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- RP2040/RP2350\u306ePIO\u3068DMA\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u51e6\u7406", "- CPU\u3092\u89e3\u653e\u3059\u308b\uff01RP2040/RP2350\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fdI/O\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u4e00\u3064\u306eROM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6210\u9577\u3068RP2350\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u9ad8\u901fI/O\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308bRP2040/RP2350\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u4f5c\u6210", "- PIO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

In the news this week: youve got a second and final chance to get your Supercon talk proposals in!\u00a0 So get on that, because we need YOU to help make Supercon awesome.\nWe can chalk up a win for Kristina on Whats That Sound this week (finally!). Will you get it right? Will you get it exactly right? Time and Elliots fancy dice will tell.\nThen its on to the hacks, where we check out a cool RFID emulator e-paper badge, discuss whether a certain type of record player is better off as a cyberdeck, and look through the eye of a Gameboy-style camera for the Playdate console.\nFrom there we take a look at gutting and rooting voice assistants, a solenoid keyboard, and a beautifully rebuilt VR headset that now does AR as well. Finally we talk autonomous solar boats, lambast ChatGPT as the worst summer intern ever, and ponder what makes a thing count as Linux or not.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\n\nEpisode 229 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nProcrastinators Rejoice! 2023 Supercon Call For Participation Extended\nSerious Vulnerability In European Trunked Radio System\nVanMoof E-Bike Bankruptcy: The Risks Of Cloud-Connected Transport\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nKnow the sound?

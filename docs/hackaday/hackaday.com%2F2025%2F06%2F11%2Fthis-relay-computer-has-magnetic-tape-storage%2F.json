Its likely not to be the first storage tech that would spring to mind when considering a relay computer, but thats just what [DiPDoT] has done by giving his machine tape storage.\nWe like this hack, in particular because its synchronous. Where the cassette storage of old just had the data stream, this one uses both channels of a stereo cassette deck, one for clock and the other data. Its encoded as a sequence of tones, which are amplified at playback (by a tube amp, of course) to drive a rectifier which fires the relay.\nOn the record side the tones are made by an Arduino, something which we fully understand but at the same time cant help wondering whether something electromechanical could be used instead. Either way, it works well enough to fill a relay shift register with each byte, which can then be transferred to the memory. Its detailed in a series of videos, the first of which weve paced below the break.\nIf you want more cassette tape goodness, while this may be the slowest, someone else is making a much faster cassette interface.\n", "title": "- \u9332\u97f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6539\u9020", "body": "\u78c1\u6c17\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u540c\u671f\u5f0f\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5b9f\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9332\u97f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30e5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u8a18\u9332\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4f1d\u9001\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30d5\u30c8\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u9001\u308b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u9045\u3044\u304c\u78ba\u5b9f\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u6280\u8853"]}

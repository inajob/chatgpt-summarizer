HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey and J.A.R.V.I.S. from the contemporary Iron Man films are both great examples. They\u2019re erudite, wise, and capable of doing just about any reasonable task that is asked of them, short of opening the pod bay doors.\nCut back to reality, and you\u2019ll only be disappointed at how useless most voice assistants are. It\u2019s been twelve long years since Siri burst onto the scene, with Alexa and Google Assistant following years later. Despite years on the market, their capabilities remain limited and uninspiring. It\u2019s time for voice assistants to level up.\n\nIs There Anything You Can Do?\nAlexa allows users to easily purchase common household items via voice queries. It can readily search prior orders to help nail down the correct item. Its a useful feature many rely on every day.\u00a0Amazon\nThe modern crop of voice assistants were, in many ways, a gamechanger when they first hit the market. They gave us our first real taste of interacting with computers in natural language. No more did we have to carefully craft exact commands for a simplistic voice recognition system. Instead, the idea was that we could speak almost normally, and the assistant would respond.\nThese days, voice assistants can handle a broad spectrum of tasks. You can use them to send a message, if you trust the voice recognition not to misrepresent your words, or you can add events to your calendar. You can do basic maths, play songs, and even switch your lights on and off  assuming you\u2019ve knitted your smarthome together properly. Google and Amazon will let you make purchases, too, within certain parameters.\nFundamentally, though, these are all pretty basic party tricks. In all of these cases, the voice assistant is basically just saving the user a few mouseclicks, or saving them from pulling out their smartphone. The problem is a lack of higher intelligence and thinking that would make them truly useful, like a proper human assistant.\nAsk Google Assistant to recommend you a good local restaurant, and you\u2019ll be disappointed. Nine times out of ten, it will just type \u201crestaurants near me\u201d into Google and show you a list. A human assistant would know that you prefer steak and pub food to tapas, do the research, and come back to you accordingly. Big tech companies have all this data on most of us, or are certainly able to collect it, but they\u2019re not employing it in this useful way.\nThe Flight Booking Test\nPicture another scenario. You\u2019re road tripping down the highway towards the airport, and you need to book a flight on the way. Our movie protagonists would surely bark a simple request at their AI assistant, who would respond with a series of convenient flights and prices. The appropriate bookings would then be handled with pre-stored payment information.\nTry that with Google Assistant or Bixby today, and you\u2019ll get nowhere. The former will simply dump you into a web search. The latter has a dedicated add-on for looking at flights, but it\u2019s virtually unusable, failing to properly understand the right departing and arriving airports. Siri is similarly weak-minded, faltering when asked to look into available hotels online.\nYes, it\u2019s that bad. You have a powerful smartphone sitting next to you in the car. It can understand what you say perfectly well, but it\u2019s entirely powerless to execute even a simple request.\nContrast that to having a friend in the passenger seat, who could simply read you out a couple of flights and ask which you want to buy. It\u2019s not that hard, but your voice assistant can\u2019t do it.\n\nA user asks Siri to book a hotel in Melbourne, Australia. When that fails, they decide to try Hong Kong instead, with the assistant faring little better. According to the user, at best, Siri would allow the user to make a phone call to the hotel in question. It took over ten attempts just to get that far. Booking directly was impossible.\nIt\u2019s true that some innovation in this area has been made; Amazon integrated bookings with various airlines with Alexa years ago, for example. The problem is that piecemeal efforts don\u2019t cut it. For such a feature to be useful, it has to work properly almost all of the time. Voice recognition technology has been the subject of mockery since the 1990s for its poor reliability. It\u2019s a lesson that today\u2019s voice assistants could learn from. It\u2019s all well and good if a user can book flights with a certain airline in the continental US using their voice assistant. If it fails every time they\u2019re in a different country, or wanting to fly a different airline, then the users will give up because the feature is functionally useless most of the time.\nIt bears noting that many of these situations are regionally variable, too. For example, if you\u2019re in the US, you might find that flight and hotel bookings are more readily available to your smart assistant. Or, in Australia, you might note that the Google Assistant has a good handle on movie session times. But the regional variability and the inconsistency are the big problem that really spoils these features.\nWhats The Fix?\nSmart speakers are selling en masse, as are smartphones with voice assistants baked in. Building one with a real edge in capability could be a competitive advantage. Amazon\nThese are just a few examples; you can probably think of thousands more. These fundamentally aren\u2019t even technically difficult queries for an assistant to respond to. Not only that, but the required information is already available online. The problem comes down to two factors: integration, and authority.\nSolving the integration problem requires a certain level of work on the back end. Companies would need to hook into existing databases and ensure their voice assistants can reliably parse and work with the data. This would require agreements and coordination with external companies in many cases, further complicating the issue.\nAs for authority, that\u2019s something companies have struggled with since the dawn of smart assistants. Amazon, and more recently Google, will allow you to purchase items with your smart assistant. However, that has required protections to be put in place after awkward instances of TV broadcasts inadvertently triggering home devices. Similarly, there are risks for families, where young children might ask a helpful voice assistant to make purchases without prior parental authorization. However, in the case of a user speaking directly into their smartphone, it\u2019s hard to imagine that voice fingerprinting or a simple device unlock wouldn\u2019t be enough to authorize purchases.\nGiven a greater level of integration, and thus utility, is possible, why aren\u2019t big tech companies rushing to unlock this functionality? The real key may be that it doesn\u2019t serve them any real purpose. Tech companies could certainly put in the work to advance voice assistant capabilities, but it would take time and money. Nevermind the greater risks to reputation if the newly granted authority allowed smart assistants to do something truly inconvenient or awful for users. The voice assistants we already have arent exactly money spinners as it is, so its perhaps no surprise the difficult and expensive problems arent being solved.\nMany will say that the problems listed here are edge cases, and that nobody uses their voice assistants this way. This author would counter that nobody does because it simply doesnt work right now. The very spawning idea for this article came from a long drive, where it became apparent that I would have to spend half an hour clicking my way through various basic admin tasks because my voice assistant was completely incapable to help. Twelve years after the first one hit the market, it shouldnt be that way.\nIf one voice assistant does begin to crest the integration mountain, things could change. If it performs reliably, it will also earn the authority to act that we dont currently give to humble smart assistants today. At that point, you can expect rival tech companies to improve their own products to match. Until one company makes the first move, though, were out of luck. Well all be wishing we had a real assistant to help us out, rather than the impotent disembodied voices that currently live in our smartphones.", "title": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3082\u3063\u3068\u8ce2\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3079\u304d - \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b", "body": "\u73fe\u5728\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u304b\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u5b58\u5728\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u77e5\u8b58\u3084\u601d\u8003\u304c\u6b20\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5f7c\u3089\u306b\u4efb\u305b\u3066\u3082\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u5927\u624b\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u4f01\u696d\u306f\u3053\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3082\u3063\u3068\u8ce2\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3079\u304d - \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u5931\u671b - \u3082\u3063\u3068\u9ad8\u3044\u77e5\u80fd\u3068\u601d\u8003\u529b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3057\u304b\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044 - \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u4e88\u7d04\u3084\u691c\u7d22\u306b\u306f\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u305a", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u822a\u7a7a\u4e88\u7d04\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044 - \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6307\u793a\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u305a\u306b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u691c\u7d22\u306b\u98db\u3070\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306f\u5730\u57df\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u7570\u306a\u308b - \u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u5834\u6240\u3084\u5730\u57df\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b"]}

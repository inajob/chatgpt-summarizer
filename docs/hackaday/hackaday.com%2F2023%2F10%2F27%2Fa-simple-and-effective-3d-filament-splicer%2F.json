The problem with simply melting them together is that the resulting join has a blob of plastic surrounding it which has difficulty making it through the printers internals. [Pete Prodoehl] has a solution, in the form of a well-executed splicing jig thats sure to leave a join which will glide through your printer.\nThe trick lies in performing the join in a space only marginally wider than the filament width, in the case of 1.75 mm filament a short piece of 1.775 mm PTFE tube encased in a 3D printed clamp. A 90-degree cut piece of filament is fed through the tube and heated with a candle, then withdrawn into the tube where a 45-degree cut piece is pushed in to fuse with it. The result is a seamless and bulge-less join, that can pass through an extruder without issue and print continuous pieces from different filaments.\nIts a very effective technique, but its not the only one weve seen over the years. This one by comparison heats the filament in a hair straightener, and relies on gently pulling the join apart as it solidifies in order to reduce the bulge."}

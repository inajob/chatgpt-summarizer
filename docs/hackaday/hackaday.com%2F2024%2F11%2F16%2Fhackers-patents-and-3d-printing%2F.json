We\u2019re absolutely not lawyers here at Hackaday, but we\u2019ve been in the amateur 3D printing revolution since the very beginning, and surprisingly patents have played a role all along.\nModern fused-deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing began with Stratasys\u2019 patent US5121329A, \u201cApparatus and method for creating three-dimensional objects\u201d, and the machines they manufactured and sold based on the technology. Go read the patent, it\u2019s an absolute beauty and has 44 different claims that cover just about everything in FDM printing. This was the watershed invention, and today, everything claimed in the patent is free.\nStratasys\u2019 patent on the fundamental FDM method kept anyone else from commercializing it until the patent expired in 2009. Not coincidentally, the first available home-gamer 3D printer, the Makerbot Cupcake, also went on sale in 2009.\nThe Stratasys machines were also one of the big inspirations for Adrian Bowyer to start the RepRap project, the open-source movement that basically lead to us all having cheap and cheerful 3D printers today, and he didn\u2019t let the patent stop him from innovating before it lapsed. Indeed, the documentation for the RepRap Darwin dates back to 2007. Zach [Hoeken] Smith delivered our hackerspace the acrylic parts to make one just around that time, and we had it running a year or two before the Cupcake came out of the company that he, Bre, and Adam shortly thereafter founded.\nThe story of hackers and 3D printers is longer than the commercial version of the same story would imply, and a lot of important innovations have come out of our community since then too. For instance, have a look at Stratasys\u2019 patent on heated bed technology. At first read, it seems to cover removable heated beds, but have a look at the cutout at the end of claim 1: \u201cwherein the polymer coating is not a polymer tape\u201d. This cutout is presumably in response to the at-the-time common practice of buying Kapton, PEI, or PET tape and applying that to removable heated bed surfaces. I know I was doing that in 2012, because I read about it on IRC or something, long before the Stratasys patent was filed in 2014. They could only get a patent for sprayed-on coatings.\nAs [Helge] points out, it\u2019s also easily verifiable that the current patent on \u201cbrick layers\u201d that we\u2019re worrying about, filed in 2020, comes later than this feature request to Prusa Slicer that covers essentially the same thing in 2019. We assume that the patent examiner simply missed that obvious prior art \u2013 they are human after all. But I certainly wouldn\u2019t hesitate to implement this feature given the documented timing.\nI would even be so bold as to say that most of the post-2010 innovation in 3D printing has been made by hobbyists. While the RepRap movement was certainly inspired by Stratasys\u2019 invention in the beginning, our community is where the innovation is happening now, and maybe even more starkly on the software side of things than the hardware. Either way, as long as you\u2019re just doing it for fun, let the suits worry about the patents. Hackers gotta hack.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

But the Ford Motor Company in Mexico wants to help dogs that need mobility assistance. Theyve designed and released P-Raptor (we presume the P is for perro), a wheelchair for pooches with rear legs. The web page is in Spanish, and translating it didnt seem to work for some reason, but if you have any Spanish, you can probably work it out, or cut and paste just the text into your favorite translator.\nThe design is modular to adapt to different size dogs and different problems. It contains an electric motor in the tires. The tires themselves are oversized to help your friend cover rugged terrain. Dogs want to look cool, too, a s grill with lighting is included.\n\nThe release says it will be available for free download soon. Youll enter your pups dimensions and other information and download custom-sized parts for you to print. All3DP mentions that they contacted Ford and were told that the final version wont be ready until 2024. Plenty of time to tune up your 3D printer for the challenge.\nJust because a puppy is born with no hind legs doesnt mean he cant be super cute. If you dont mind a slightly more industrial look, weve seen other doggie wheelchairs before, too.", "title": "\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u72ac\u7528\u96fb\u52d5\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u3001\u300cP-Raptor\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3001\u811a\u306e\u4e0d\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u72ac\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u300cP-Raptor\u300d\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3001\u7121\u511f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3059\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u72ac\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u30022024\u5e74\u306b\u6700\u7d42\u7248\u304c\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u72ac\u7528\u96fb\u52d5\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u3001\u300cP-Raptor\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u72ac\u7528\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "\u72ac\u7528\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u300cP-Raptor\u300d\u304c\u7121\u6599\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u72ac\u7528\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u30012024\u5e74\u307e\u3067\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u7248\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a", "\u80cc\u811a\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u53ef\u611b\u304f\uff01\u72ac\u7528\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u52d5\u3051\u308b"]}

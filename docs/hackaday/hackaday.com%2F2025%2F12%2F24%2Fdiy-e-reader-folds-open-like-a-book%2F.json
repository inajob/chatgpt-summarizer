There arent nearly as many that come with\u00a0two.\u00a0[Martin den Hoed] developed the Diptyx e-reader with such a design in order to better replicate the paper books of old.\u00a0\nThe build is based around the ESP32-S3, a powerful microcontroller which comes with the benefit of having WiFi connectivity baked in. Its hooked up to a pair of 648480 e-paper displays, which are installed in a fold-open housing to create the impression that one is reading a traditional book. The displays themselves are driven with custom look-up tables to allow for low-latency updates when turning pages. The firmware of the device is inspired by the epub reader from [Atomic14], and can handle different fonts and line spacing without issue. Power is from a pair of 1,500 mAh lithium-polymer cells, which should keep the device running for a good long time, and they can be charged over USB-C like any\u00a0 modern gadget.\nYou can follow along with the project on the official website, or check it out on Crowd Supply if youre so inclined. The project is intended to be open source, with files to be released once the design is finalized for an initial production run.\nWeve seen some great DIY e-reader builds over the years, and were loving the development were seeing in the writer deck space, too.

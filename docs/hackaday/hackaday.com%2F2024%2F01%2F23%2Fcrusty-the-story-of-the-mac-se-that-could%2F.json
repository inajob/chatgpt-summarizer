This is the story of two people who sought to answer one of the greatest questions in the universe: What does it take to kill a Mac SE?\nCrustys mainboard as found\nThe star of the show here is Crusty, a Mac SE that was found on the loading dock of a scrap company. It sat out in the weather for at least 6 months, complete with the original leaking NiCad battery.\nEnter [RadRacer203], who is friends with the owner of this particular scrap company. [RadRacer203] and picked up Crusty, along with a few other classic Macs. He brought these machines to VCF East 2021, where our other hero comes in. [CJ] is something of a magician with CRTs and analog electronics. Trained under [Sark] himself, [CJ] has mastered the 5-finger exploding capacitor technique.\nThe battery had eaten through the mainboard and even into the chassis. But after a thorough cleaning, the damn thing booted up. Crusty was born.\nThis Mac was a survivor. Much like Top Gear and their Pluky Toyota Hilux, [RadRacer203] and [CJ] devised a plan to put Crusty to the test.\nClick through the break for more!\n\nTest 1: Bury it for 6 months.\n[RadRacer203] lives on a large computer ranch. He took Crusty out to the back 40\u00a0 and buried him. [CJ] is quick to mention they did remove the IWM chip before burial, as he and [RadRacer203] arent monsters. After 6 months underground, Crusty was dug up just in time to attend VCF East, still wearing his muddy attire. [CJ] immediately went to work. While the burial had rusted a few parts, it only took a bit of cleaning to get Crusty up and running again. The machine would not die. Obviously, this required drastic measures.\n\nTest 2: Submerge it in a creek for 8 months.\nGlug glug glug\nDid we mention [RadRacer203] lives on a large computer farm? This includes a\u00a0 creek. He chucked Crusty in and walked away. Crusty was only retrieved 8 months later when the danger of a hard freeze put the CRT itself at risk. Rather than winter in the water, Crusty became a Halloween decoration and spent some time as the head of a rather dapper looking snowman.\nAt this point, Crusty was a bit of a celebrity, and his next appearance at VCF East 2023 included meeting and getting signatures from several notable YouTubers. Unfortunately [CJ] wasnt quite able to get him working this time. The 1/8-watt power supply feedback resistors rusted right off the PCB.\n[CJ] was undaunted. Fast forward to VCF Midwest 2023, and he was going to give Crusty the best possible chance of running again.\u00a0 [CJ] had everything he needed. Except cleaning supplies. Not a problem, as there was plenty of Old Bay vodka available. This was perfect for cleaning up the boards and made everyone around hungry looking for crabcakes.\nDid Crusty live? Well let [CJ] tell the rest of the story on his page. Well just say were in awe of his skills in bringing old decrepit hardware back to life."}

This is the story of two people who sought to answer one of the greatest questions in the universe: What does it take to kill a Mac SE?\nCrustys mainboard as found\nThe star of the show here is Crusty, a Mac SE that was found on the loading dock of a scrap company. It sat out in the weather for at least 6 months, complete with the original leaking NiCad battery.\nEnter [RadRacer203], who is friends with the owner of this particular scrap company. [RadRacer203] and picked up Crusty, along with a few other classic Macs. He brought these machines to VCF East 2021, where our other hero comes in. [CJ] is something of a magician with CRTs and analog electronics. Trained under [Sark] himself, [CJ] has mastered the 5-finger exploding capacitor technique.\nThe battery had eaten through the mainboard and even into the chassis. But after a thorough cleaning, the damn thing booted up. Crusty was born.\nThis Mac was a survivor. Much like Top Gear and their Pluky Toyota Hilux, [RadRacer203] and [CJ] devised a plan to put Crusty to the test.\nClick through the break for more!\n\nTest 1: Bury it for 6 months.\n[RadRacer203] lives on a large computer ranch. He took Crusty out to the back 40\u00a0 and buried him. [CJ] is quick to mention they did remove the IWM chip before burial, as he and [RadRacer203] arent monsters. After 6 months underground, Crusty was dug up just in time to attend VCF East, still wearing his muddy attire. [CJ] immediately went to work. While the burial had rusted a few parts, it only took a bit of cleaning to get Crusty up and running again. The machine would not die. Obviously, this required drastic measures.\n\nTest 2: Submerge it in a creek for 8 months.\nGlug glug glug\nDid we mention [RadRacer203] lives on a large computer farm? This includes a\u00a0 creek. He chucked Crusty in and walked away. Crusty was only retrieved 8 months later when the danger of a hard freeze put the CRT itself at risk. Rather than winter in the water, Crusty became a Halloween decoration and spent some time as the head of a rather dapper looking snowman.\nAt this point, Crusty was a bit of a celebrity, and his next appearance at VCF East 2023 included meeting and getting signatures from several notable YouTubers. Unfortunately [CJ] wasnt quite able to get him working this time. The 1/8-watt power supply feedback resistors rusted right off the PCB.\n[CJ] was undaunted. Fast forward to VCF Midwest 2023, and he was going to give Crusty the best possible chance of running again.\u00a0 [CJ] had everything he needed. Except cleaning supplies. Not a problem, as there was plenty of Old Bay vodka available. This was perfect for cleaning up the boards and made everyone around hungry looking for crabcakes.\nDid Crusty live? Well let [CJ] tell the rest of the story on his page. Well just say were in awe of his skills in bringing old decrepit hardware back to life.", "title": "\u300c\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01Mac SE\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "body": "\u7b46\u8005\u304c\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305fMac SE\u300cCrusty\u300d\u306f\u3001\u5916\u30676\u30f6\u6708\u653e\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u305f\u72b6\u614b\u3067\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u8150\u98df\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u5f8c\u306b\u8d77\u52d5\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u8010\u3048\u3001VCF East\u3067\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305fYouTuber\u305f\u3061\u3068\u3082\u4f1a\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002[CJ]\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u7269\u306f\u5fa9\u5143\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u306f\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d9\u30a4\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30ab\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01Mac SE\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u8010\u4e45\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff01Mac SE\u30926\u30f6\u6708\u9593\u57cb\u3081\u3066\u307f\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u300d", "\u300c\u6c34\u6ca1\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff01\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u306b8\u30f6\u6708\u9593\u6c88\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305fMac SE\u306e\u904b\u547d\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u5909\u308f\u308a\u8005\u306e\u30de\u30c3\u30af\uff01Crusty\u306eVCF East 2021\u3067\u306e\u6d3b\u8e8d\u300d", "\u300c\u9b54\u8853\u5e2b\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff01\u58ca\u308c\u305fMac SE\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d"]}

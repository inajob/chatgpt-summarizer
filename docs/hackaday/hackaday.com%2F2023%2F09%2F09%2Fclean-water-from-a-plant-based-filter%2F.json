A clear mountain stream could have a dead sheep in it just upstream, for example. Maybe you learned to boil it, or perhaps add chemical tablets. Up-to-date campers have a range of filters at their disposal thanks to nanotechnology, but such devices arent the only options to avoid sickness. [BeraAjan] has built one using plant xylem.\nThe inspiration for this filter came from an MIT paper, and the plant xylem in question isnt the thin layer we were expecting but a far thicker one found in young conifer branches. In fact, the whole twig without its bark is placed in a tube, and the water filters through it.\nIts fair to say that this isnt the fastest of filters though, as you can see in the video below the break. Hes combined a few individual filters, but maybe its not for the easily bored.\n\n\nHeader image: USFWS, Public domain."}

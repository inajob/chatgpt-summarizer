A clear mountain stream could have a dead sheep in it just upstream, for example. Maybe you learned to boil it, or perhaps add chemical tablets. Up-to-date campers have a range of filters at their disposal thanks to nanotechnology, but such devices arent the only options to avoid sickness. [BeraAjan] has built one using plant xylem.\nThe inspiration for this filter came from an MIT paper, and the plant xylem in question isnt the thin layer we were expecting but a far thicker one found in young conifer branches. In fact, the whole twig without its bark is placed in a tube, and the water filters through it.\nIts fair to say that this isnt the fastest of filters though, as you can see in the video below the break. Hes combined a few individual filters, but maybe its not for the easily bored.\n\n\nHeader image: USFWS, Public domain.", "title": "\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30b7\u30ec\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u6c34\u6e90\u3092\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u9ad8\u304f\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u91ce\u5916\u3067\u306f\u6c34\u6e90\u304c\u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3068\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30b7\u30ec\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u6c34\u6e90\u3092\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u9ad8\u304f\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u969b\u306e\u6c34\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u3068\u5bfe\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ca\u30ce\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u624b\u6bb5\u3067\u75c5\u6c17\u3092\u4e88\u9632\u3057\u3088\u3046", "MIT\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u304b\u3089\u7740\u60f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30b7\u30ec\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u3067\u306e\u6c34\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

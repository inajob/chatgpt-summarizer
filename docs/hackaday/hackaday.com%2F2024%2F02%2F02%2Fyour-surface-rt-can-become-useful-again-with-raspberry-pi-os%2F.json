The Surface RT was one of these: while the hardware was at least as good if not better than Apples iPad, its ARM CPU and an ill-advised signed-apps-only policy meant the tablet couldnt access the huge existing library of Windows software.\nConsumers didnt want a tablet with next-to-no apps, so it failed miserably. Never mind though, because [Michael MJD] has a video showing how an RT can be given a new life from an unlikely source, with the installation of Raspberry Pi OS.\nThe video pretty closely follows this guide, and involves creating a Raspberry Pi OS install medium modified with RT-specific kernel modules and device tree. Its possible because the 32-bit ARM architecture is one of those which Raspberry Pi OS targets, and while a few things such as graphics acceleration dont work, its still successful (if a little slow).\nOddly this is a technique not unlike one from the earliest days of the Raspberry Pi, when we remember people in Raspberry Pi Jams showing off the ancestor of the modern OS running on cheap ARM-based netbooks. In those cases the hack relied on transplanting the Pi userland over the devices existing kernel, wed be interested in an explanation of how the RT can use the Pi kernel without the famous Broadcom BLOB intended for the Pi.\nWe have a soft spot for the RT, as we said a good product held back by a very bad software decision. Seeing it take a new life years later is thus pleasing to us.\n\n\nSurface RT image: Decade City, CC BY 2.0."}

[Michael Rechtin] did just that,\u00a0with a hefty design of his own creation.\nThe build is an exploration of all kinds of interesting techniques. The frame itself uses generative design techniques to reduce weight while maintaining strength, while the motors themselves make heavy use of 3D-printed components. The design is modular and much of it slots together, too, and it uses a homebrewed flight controller running dRehmflight. It draws 2.5 kW from its lithium polymer batteries and weighs over 5 kg.\nThe DIY ethos led to some hurdles, but taught [Michael] plenty along the way. Tuning the PID control loop posed some challenges, as did one of the hand-wound motors being 5% down on thrust.\u00a0 Eventually, though, the quad flew well enough to crash into a rectangular gate, before hitting the ground. Any quad pilot will tell you that these things happen.\u00a0Drilling into the quad with a battery still inside then led to a fire, which did plenty of further damage.\n[Michaels] quad doesnt appear to be specifically optimized to any one task, and its easy to see many ways in which it could be lightened or otherwise upgraded. However, as a freeform engineering thinking exercise, its interesting to watch as he tackles various problems and iteratively improves the design. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

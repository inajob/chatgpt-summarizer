[Jason Scatena] knows this only too well, hes got a 1976 Honda CJ360 twin, and the rubber bushes that secure its side panels are perished. New ones are hard to come by at a sensible price, so he set about casting his own in silicone.\nNaturally this story is of particular interest to owners of old motorcycles, but the techniques should be worth a read to anyone, as we see how he refined his 3D printed mold design and then how he used mica powder to give the clear silicone its black colour. The final buses certainly look the part especially when fitted to the bike frame, and we hope theyll keep those Honda side panels in place for decades to come. Where this is being written theres a CB400F in storage, for which well have to remember this project when its time to reactivate it.\nIf fettling old bikes is your thing then we hope youre in good company here, however were unsure that many of you will have restored the parts bin for an entire marque."}

Like many instruments from that time period, this one had a lot of tobacco smoke residue inside. The display unit inside had a sticker that not only showed the company that made it, but also had their Telex number on it, another sign of the times. You can see the device in the video below.\nThe unit looked like a one-off made by a hobbyist or a technician but the case looked suspiciously like old Bang and Olfusen equipment. Someone in the video comments mentions it was built for the service department.\n\nSome of the wiring had not survived well and there was a broken display digit. Whats more, is the millivolt marking applied to the display. The actual instrument has dividers that provide readings in volts, not millivolts.\nThat Beckman display is very retro and [Thomas] breaks into that subassembly if you fancy a peek inside. Beckman made some interesting displays. Voltmeters sure have changed over the years.\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30df\u30ea\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u8a08\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001Thomas\u304c\u53e4\u3044\u30df\u30ea\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u3001\u4e2d\u306b\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u306e\u7159\u304c\u6b8b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c17\u3065\u304f\u3002\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001Beckman\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u53e4\u98a8\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u306fBang and Olfusen\u88fd\u54c1\u306b\u4f3c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5909\u5316\u3082\u6307\u6458\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30df\u30ea\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u8a08\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3059\u308b", "\u53e4\u3044\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u6539\u9020", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u8a08\u6e2c\u6a5f\u5668", "Beckman\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u4e00\u6319\u516c\u958b", "\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

If someone else is printing a part, that parts designer has no actual control over these things. So how can one ensure sturdier pins without relying on specific print settings? [Slant 3D] covers two approaches.\nThe first approach includes making a pin thick, making it short (less leverage for stress), and adding a fillet to the sharp corner where the pin meets the rest of the part. Why? Because a rounded corner spreads stress out, compared to a sharp corner.\n\nMicrofeatures can ensure increased strength in a way that doesnt depend on slicer settings.\nThose are general best practices, but theres even more that can be done with microfeatures. These\u00a0are used to get increased strength as a side effect of how a 3D printer actually works when making a part.\nOne type of microfeature is to give the pin a bunch of little cutouts, making the cross-section look like a gear instead of a circle. The little cutouts dont affect how the pin works, but increase the surface area of each layer, making the part stronger.\nA denser infill increases strength, too. Again, instead of relying on slicer settings, one can use microfeatures for a similar result. Small slots extending down through the pin (and going into the part itself) dont affect how the part works, but make the part sturdier. Because of how filament-based 3D printing works, these sorts of features are more or less free and dont rely on specific printer or slicer settings.\n[Slant 3D] frequently shares design tips like this, often focused on designing parts that are easier and more reliable to print. For example, while printers are great at generating useful support structures, sometimes its better and easier in the long run to just design supports directly into the part.\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308bCAD\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u3084\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u7279\u5fb4\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u5897\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308bCAD\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b5\u30fc\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u30d4\u30f3\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f"]}

[Peterzieba] does, and has pulled together a collection of documents and tools so that you can too. Theres a dividing line in electronic engineering education, between those who were taught about FPGAs, and those who werent. Blurring that line slightly is gate array logic (GAL). These devices were a preceursor to the FPGA, with a much simpler structure, and usually in those days UV-erasable in the same manner as an EPROM. And oddly enough, they, or at least their successor compatible parts, are still available, and as handy DIP devices that talk to 5 volt logic.\nThe guide goes into detail about the parts, the terminology surrounding them, and the CUPL language which raises a few memories for us. There are several possible workflows, including for those not faint of heart, the possibility of writing a fusemap by hand. Were impressed by that one.\nIf these devices interest you, our colleague Bil Herd wrote a two-part guide (part one, and part two) which should answer your questions.\nThanks [Bjonnh] for the tip!\nFeatured image: Commodore Amiga 1000  sub board  Texas Instruments PAL16L8ACN-0126 by Raimond Spekking", "title": "GAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\uff1a\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u8208\u5473\u306e\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u3078", "body": "GAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u3084\u7528\u8a9e\u3001CUPL\u8a00\u8a9e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u624b\u66f8\u304d\u306e\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002GAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306f\u3001\u540c\u50da\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30fb\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u6c0f\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["GAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\uff1a\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u8208\u5473\u306e\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u3078", "5\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064UV\u66f8\u304d\u6d88\u3057\u53ef\u80fd\u306aGAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aGAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3068\u7528\u8a9e\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u3067EPROM\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6271\u3048\u308bGAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\uff01", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u305b\u308b\uff1aGAL\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306eCUPL\u8a00\u8a9e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u307c\u3046"]}

This is amply demonstrated by the work of [Charlie Humble-Thomas], who has taken an everyday object, the umbrella, and used it to pose the question: How long should objects last?\nHe explores the topic by making three different umbrellas, none of which we are guessing resemble those you could buy. The first is not particularly durable but is completely recyclable, the second is designed entirely with repairability in mind, while the third is hugely over-engineered and designed for durability. In each case the reader is intended to think about the impact of the umbrella before them.\nWhat strikes us is how much better designed each one is than the typical cheap umbrella on sale today, with the polypropylene recyclable one being flimsy by design, but with a simplicity missing from its commercial counterpart. The durable one meanwhile is full of CNC parts, and carbon fiber.\nIf youre hungry for more student work in this vein, we recently brought you this toasty typewriter.", "title": "\u5de5\u696d\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u5098\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u8003\u5bdf", "body": "\u5b66\u751f\u304c\u5de5\u696d\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u5352\u696d\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u3001\u666e\u6bb5\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\u6642\u671f\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u7279\u306b\u3001\u5098\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u7269\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5de5\u696d\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u5098\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u8003\u5bdf", "\u5098\u3092\u984c\u6750\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u5098\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b\uff1a\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u5bff\u547d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u554f\u3044\u304b\u3051", "\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u5098\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u898b\u3048\u308b\u5275\u9020\u6027", "\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u54c1\u7d39\u4ecb\uff1a\u5de5\u5b66\u3068\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u4ea4\u5dee\u3059\u308b\u5275\u9020\u7684\u306a\u5098\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

This was very much the case with older washing machines and other white goods, and while their modern equivalents may have switched to more understandable motors, there are still plenty of the older ones to be had. [Matthias random stuff] sheds a bit of light on how these motors worked, by means of a 1980s Maytag washing machine motor.\nMany of us will be used to old-style induction motors, in which two windings were fed out of phase via a large capacitor. This one doesnt have a capacitor, instead it has a primary winding and a secondary one with a higher resistance. Were not quite sure the explanation of the resistance contributing to a phase shift holds water, however this winding is connected in for a short time at start-up by a centrifugal switch. Even better, reversing its polarity reverses the direction of the motor.\nThe result is a mess of wires demystified, and a mains powered motor with a bit of strength for your projects. Weve let a few of these motors slip through our fingers in the past, perhaps we shouldnt have been so hasty.\nThis is a subject that weve looked at in the past.\n\n"}

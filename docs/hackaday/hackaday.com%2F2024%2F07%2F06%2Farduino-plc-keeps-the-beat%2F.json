Theyre both easy to program and easy to wire up to projects without breaking the bank. But if you step into an industrial setting where reliability is paramount even in places that are noisy, vibrating all the time, hot, or otherwise unpleasant for electronics, youll want to reach for a programmable logic controller (PLC) that are much more robust. There is actually a PLC from Arduino, and if you want to dip your toes into the PLC world then take a look at this drum kit based on the Arduino Opta.\nWith the PLC at the core of the build, its on to making the drumming mechanisms themselves. For that, project creator [JC Audio] is using a series of solenoids attached to camera mounts with a custom 3D printed part that allows for quick assembly and disassembly so he can get the positioning of each drum sound just right. The high hat is taken care of by the noise of an internal solenoid, with the other drums striking various real drums and other solid objects in his shops. The solenoids themselves are driven by a solid-state relay expansion module to ensure theres enough power\nWhile the build doesnt sit inside a factory and run for years at a time, a musicians stage is certainly a rough enough environment that we might reach for a PLC over a standard development board for its benefits. The code for this project is available as well at the projects GitHub page for those looking for a more advanced timekeeper to play along with their music practice, and for more details on why you might choose a PLC for your project take a look at this Arduino vs PLC showdown from a few years ago.\n\n", "title": "Arduino Opta\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Arduino Uno\u306a\u3069\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u304c\u3001\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u7523\u696d\u73fe\u5834\u3067\u306f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\uff08PLC\uff09\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Arduino Opta\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u4f8b\u3082\u3002PLC\u3092\u4e2d\u5fc3\u306b\u636e\u3048\u3001\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u7b49\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30e1\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c\u3002GLT\u62e1\u5f35\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3002", "titles": ["Arduino Opta\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u97f3\u697d\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5411\u3051\u306ePLC\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0", "\u9ad8\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306a\u74b0\u5883\u5411\u3051\u306bPLC\u3092\u9078\u629e\u3059\u308b\u7406\u7531", "\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u7528\u306e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bArduino\u3068PLC\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

[Farid] made this moving arrow that always points at the ISS, and documented it nicely to boot.\nAnd there\u2019s a little bit of everything here, from orbital mechanics and fetching the two-line elements (TLE) from the web, to writing the code to translate that into the tabletop machine\u2019s coordinate system. It looks like [Farid] hadn\u2019t done much 3D CAD before, so he got a chance to stretch those muscles too. Finally, it served as an introduction to resource-constrained programming: \u201cThis was the first time I\u2019ve had to think about the size of a compiled binary  the most frustrating part was figuring out that using a C++ stringstream was adding too much code to my binary.\u201d\n[Farid] is learning a lot here, and you might too. For instance, using pencil lead (graphite) as a lubricant on sliding 3D-printed parts is new to us, but makes sense. We\u2019ll have to try that out.\nAnd while this is a simple desktop tracker, with a lot more mechanical design, the same basics could be put to real use for pointing a receiver dish. Of course, who says you need fancy motors and computers to point a satellite dish anyway? If you work on your arm muscles a bit, you could become the satellite pointer."}

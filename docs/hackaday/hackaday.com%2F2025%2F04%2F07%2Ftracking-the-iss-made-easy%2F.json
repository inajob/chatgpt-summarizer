[Farid] made this moving arrow that always points at the ISS, and documented it nicely to boot.\nAnd there\u2019s a little bit of everything here, from orbital mechanics and fetching the two-line elements (TLE) from the web, to writing the code to translate that into the tabletop machine\u2019s coordinate system. It looks like [Farid] hadn\u2019t done much 3D CAD before, so he got a chance to stretch those muscles too. Finally, it served as an introduction to resource-constrained programming: \u201cThis was the first time I\u2019ve had to think about the size of a compiled binary  the most frustrating part was figuring out that using a C++ stringstream was adding too much code to my binary.\u201d\n[Farid] is learning a lot here, and you might too. For instance, using pencil lead (graphite) as a lubricant on sliding 3D-printed parts is new to us, but makes sense. We\u2019ll have to try that out.\nAnd while this is a simple desktop tracker, with a lot more mechanical design, the same basics could be put to real use for pointing a receiver dish. Of course, who says you need fancy motors and computers to point a satellite dish anyway? If you work on your arm muscles a bit, you could become the satellite pointer.", "title": "\u300c\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u6307\u3057\u793a\u305b\uff01ISS\u3092\u8ffd\u5c3e\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u304f\u77e2\u5370\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u300d", "body": "\u885b\u661f\u3092\u6307\u3057\u793a\u3059\u52d5\u304f\u77e2\u5370\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u6a5f\u68b0\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u5b66\u3073\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u6307\u3057\u793a\u305b\uff01ISS\u3092\u8ffd\u5c3e\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u304f\u77e2\u5370\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1aISS\u8ffd\u5c3e\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u8a18\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u300d", "\u300c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aC++\u3068\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u300d", "\u300c\u624b\u52d5\u3067\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u885b\u661f\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u6307\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d"]}

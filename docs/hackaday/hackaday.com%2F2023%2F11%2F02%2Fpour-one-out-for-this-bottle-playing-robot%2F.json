But what if you wanted to accompany yourself on the bottles? Well, then youd need to build a bottle-playing robot.\nFirst, [Jens Maker Adventures] wrote a song and condensed it down to eight notes. With a whole lot of tinkling with a butter knife against their collection of wine and other bottles, [Jens] was able to figure out the lowest note for a given bottle by filing it with water, and the highest note by emptying it out.\nWith the bottle notes selected, the original plan was to strike the bottles with sticks. As it turned out, 9g servos werent up to the task, so he went with solenoids instead. Using Boxes.py, he was able to parameterize a just-right bottle holder to allow for arranging the bottles in a circle and striking them from the inside, all while hiding the Arduino and the solenoid driver board. Be sure to check it out after the break.\nDont have a bunch of bottles lying around? You can use an Arduino to play the glasses.\n\n", "title": "\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u594f\u3067\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u53e9\u304f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3002\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u77e5\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6c34\u3092\u5165\u308c\u305f\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3067\u3082\u6f14\u594f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u594f\u3067\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u6c34\u306e\u91cf\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u97f3\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u594f\u3067\u65b9", "\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u53e9\u304f\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30dc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eBox.py\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

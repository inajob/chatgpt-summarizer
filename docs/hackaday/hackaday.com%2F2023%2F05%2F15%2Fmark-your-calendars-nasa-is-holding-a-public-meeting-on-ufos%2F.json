But whether you call them flying objects or anomalous phenomena, its that unidentified part that has us interested.\nWhich is why well be tuned into NASA TV at 10:30 a.m. EDT on May 31  thats when the agency has announced theyll be broadcasting a meeting of an independent study team tasked with categorizing and evaluating UAP data. The public can even submit their own questions, the most popular of which will be passed on to the team.\nBefore you get too excited, the meeting is about how NASA can evaluate and study UAP by using data, technology, and the tools of science, and the press release explains that they wont be reviewing or assessing any unidentifiable observations. So if youre hoping for the US governments tacit acknowledgment that were not alone in the universe, youll probably be disappointed. That said, they wouldnt have to assemble a team to study these reports if they were all so easily dismissed. As always, interstellar visitors are dead last on the list of possible explanations, but some cases have too much hard evidence to be dismissed out of hand. They might not be little green men, but they are something.\nMore after the break.\n\nDeclassified videos show US military aircraft encountering UAPs\nThose with an interest in such things are likely already aware of the 2022 Annual Report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The report explains that under the direction of the Secretary of Defense, an All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) had been established in July of 2022 to catalog and analyze credible UAP cases. The paper further reveals that of the 366 cases the AARO was actively investigating, only 195 could be deemed unremarkable and likely the result of a drone, balloon, or wildlife.\nDoes that mean the remaining 171 were the product of interdimensional incursions? Of course not. But the report does acknowledge that some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities which makes their identification difficult. The reports recommendation was simple enough: in order to collect more data, UAP cases needed to be taken more seriously.\nThis NASA meeting is a step towards that goal, and were looking forward to seeing the teams final recommendations when theyre released over the summer. The truth is out there."}

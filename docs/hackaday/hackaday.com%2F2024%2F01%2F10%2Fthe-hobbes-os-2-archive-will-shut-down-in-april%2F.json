Yet now it would appear that the entity behind the Hobbes OS/2 Archive, the Information  Communication Technologies department at the New Mexico State University, has decided to call it quits  with the site going permanently offline on April 15th, 2024.\nFortunately, from a cursory glance around the comment sections over at Hacker News and other places, it seems that backup efforts have already been made, and the preservation of the archives contents should be secure at this point in time. Regardless, it is always a shame to lose such a central repository, especially since IBMs OS/2 operating system is still anything but dead. Whether for hobbyist, industrial or commercial use, there is still a vibrant community around today, as we noted in 2019 already in relation to the NYCs subway system.\nBeyond downloaded copies and boxed CDs bought on EBay, you can even get a modernized version of OS/2 called ArcaOS, which even comes with commercial support. Whatever the fate is of the Hobbes OS/2 Archives data, we hope it finds a loving new home somewhere.", "title": "\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u304c\u904b\u55b6\u3059\u308b\u300cHobbes OS/2 Archive\u300d\u304c2024\u5e744\u670815\u65e5\u306b\u6c38\u4e45\u306b\u9589\u9396\u3078", "body": "New Mexico State University's Hobbes OS/2 Archive, a collection of OS/2 software, will permanently shut down on April 15th, 2024.

Although the official Raspberry Pi NVMe HAT is still a long while off, the Polish company Pineberry Pi is ramping up to release its Top  Bottom versions of its very wittily called HatDrive.\nThey sent a prototype to [Jeff Geerling], who has been putting his grubby mitts all over them before putting together a video showing off the HatDrive Top, which can accept 2230 and 2242 size NVMe drives.\nThe primary goal of adding an NVMe drive to the RPi is of course to get rid of those slow and fragile SD cards. Although the SD card standard supports near-NVMe-like speeds with UHS-III, the Raspberry Pi 5 bottoms out at UHS-I, around 100 MB/s. Despite this, using an NVMe drive for booting still takes some work, as [Jeff] lays out in a clear article. Most of this involves tweaking the /boot/config.txt file to enable external PCIe support, editing the onboard EEPROM to change the boot order (in lieu of having a PC-like BIOS screen) and getting the OS image flashed onto the NVMe drive you intend to boot from.\nAlthough things seem to work fine during [Jeff]s testing, some caveats remain, such as the RPi 5 officially supporting only PCIe Gen 2 x1, with Gen 3 possible, but with potential data integrity issues. Theres also the fundamental limit of having only a single lane of PCIe available. If thats no problem, then Pineberry Pi offers the aforementioned HatDrive Top for traditional HAT-style mounting, and a Bottom version that can accept up to 2280 format NVMe SSDs. Including the provided ribbon cables, you can order the Top and Bottom for \u20ac20 and \u20ac25.99 respectively, with the first batch to ship in early December.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "Raspberry Pi 5\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305fNVMe SSD HAT\u306e\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u3001HatDrive\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u306bNVMe SSD\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eHatDrive\u304cPolish company Pineberry Pi\u304b\u3089\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c1\u306f12\u6708\u306b\u51fa\u8377\u3002\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u306f\u3001RPi 5\u304c\u516c\u5f0f\u306b\u306fPCIe Gen 2 x1\u306e\u307f\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Gen 3\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6574\u5408\u6027\u306b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi 5\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305fNVMe SSD HAT\u306e\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u3001HatDrive\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Raspberry Pi 5\u3067SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bNVMe\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Polish company Pineberry Pi\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u4e88\u5b9a\u306eHatDrive Top\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u7d39\u4ecb", "HatDrive Bottom\u306e\u7279\u9577\uff1a2280\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30c3\u30c8\u306eNVMe SSD\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc", "Raspberry Pi 5\u306ePCIe Gen 3\u4f7f\u7528\u6642\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u6574\u5408\u6027\u554f\u984c\u3068\u5236\u7d04\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

Code for a simple LED blink can then look like:\n// index.js\nconst led = 25;\npinMode(led, OUTPUT);\nsetInterval(() =amp;gt; {\ndigitalToggle(led);\n}, 1000);\nDevelopment can then be done using tools that are very familiar to JavaScript developers, such as npm and flashing new code to a USB-connected Pico with the (Node.js-based) Kaluma command-line interface. Take a look at the GitHub repository for the project, or browse some of the projects made with Kaluma.\nMuch like with MicroPython, theres value to be had in putting implementations of high-level languages on microcontrollers. Each new language opens embedded programming to a whole new group of coders. But its not just languages making their way to the RP2040. Wonderful projects such as emulating the ZX Spectrum on an RP2040 also happen.\nThanks to [Shri Hari Ram] for the tip!"}

These machines and the Logo programming language that allowed them to draw simple vector graphics were a popular teaching tool at the time. Theyre long-forgotten now, but not in the workshop of [Niklas Roy], who has created a modern-day take on their trundling.\nHis two-wheeled robots form simple but effective vector plotters, calculating the paths between coordinates with a consistency that surprised him. Theyre used for artwork rather than functional plotting, but were guessing they could be used for either. We particularly like the drawing battle between a pair of drawing bots and an eraser bot, as it reminds us of a pixelflood screen.\nThe parts are all straightforward, its brain is an Arduino Nano, and the files can be downloaded for you to build your own. If youre falling down the Logo rabbit hole as he did, then its not the first time weve been there."}

Add in the proper software, and suddenly youve got online multiplayer for the classic handheld. The hardware was cheap, the software open source, and a good time was had by all.\nInspired by both the original project and some of the hardware variations that have popped up over the years, [weiman] recently set out to create a new version of the USB link adapter that fits inside a miniature 3D printed Game Boy.\nThe big change from the original design is that this is using the far smaller, but equally capable, RP2040-Zero development board. This is mated with a SparkFun logic level converter board (or a clone of one from AliExpress) by way of a custom PCB that also includes the necessary edge connectors to connect directly to a Game Boy Link Cable.\nOnce the PCB is assembled, its dropped into the 3D printed Game Boy shell. [weiman] really worked some nice details into the case, such as aligning the d-pad and buttons in such a way that pressing them engages either the RESET or BOOTSEL buttons on RP2040-Zero. The screen of the printed handheld also lines up with the RGB LED on the top of the dev board, which can produce some cool lighting effects.\nThe original project from [stacksmashing] was an excellent example of the capabilities of the Pi Pico, and were glad to see its still being worked on and remixed by others. Even though the state of Game Boy emulation is nearly perfect these days, theres still something to be said for working with the original hardware like this."}

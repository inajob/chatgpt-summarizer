John Logie Bairds mechanically-scanned TV may have ultimately been a dead-end superseded by the all-electronic systems we all know, but the importance of television for the later half of the 20th century and further is beyond question.\nThe standout hacks of the week include a very clever use of the ESP32s WiFi API to detect people moving through a WiFi field, a promising open-source smartphone, another ESP32 project in a comms system for cyclists, more cycling on tensegrity spokes, a clever way to smooth plaster casts, and a light sculpture reflecting Wi-Fi traffic. Then there are a slew of hacks including 3D printed PCBs and gem-cut dichroic prisms, before we move to the cant-miss articles. There were looking at document preservation, and a wallow in internet history with a look at the Netscape brand.\nAs usual all the links you need can be found below, so listen, and enjoy!\n\nOr download the podcast old-school, with a direct link to the MP3 file in question.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 354 Show Notes:\nWhats that Sound?\n\nJenny got the sound right.

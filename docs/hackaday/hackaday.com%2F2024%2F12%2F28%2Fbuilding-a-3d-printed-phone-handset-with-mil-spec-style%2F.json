A side effect of this is that the equipment usually has a distinct visual look that many people find appealing. You might not need a laptop that can survive being in a war zone, but plenty of hackers have picked such machines up on the second hand market anyway.\nCase in point, the H-250 telephone handset. [Tobias] didnt actually need a combat-ready phone handset, but loved the way it looked. Technically you can pick these up on eBay for a reasonable price, but then youve still got to deal with the weirdo military components inside it. So why not design a look-alike and 3D print it?\n[Tobias] came up with a design in OpenSCAD that has a very close resemblance to its military counterpart. Not only has he made the source code for the 3D model available for others who might want to print their own look-alike handset, but the Hackaday.io page also includes a breakdown of the hardware that needs to be added to the printed parts to make it a functional handset.\nIf you think the H-250 handset looks familiar, its probably because it comes standard issue on the TA-1042 field telephone  another very slick looking piece of military gear that weve covered previously.", "title": "\u8ecd\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b: H-250\u96fb\u8a71\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u8ecd\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u306f\u5805\u7262\u3067\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002Tobias\u306fH-250\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u8ecd\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b: H-250\u96fb\u8a71\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3001\u8ecd\u7528\u96fb\u8a71\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "H-250\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c: \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3068\u8a2d\u8a08\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9", "\u6226\u5834\u4ed5\u69d8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080: 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u96fb\u8a71\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8", "\u8ecd\u7528\u96fb\u8a71H-250\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01"]}

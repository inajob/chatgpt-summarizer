Nevertheless, technology marches on. Working in this area is YouTuber [AI Warehouse], who has been teaching an AI to walk in a simulated environment.\nAlbert needed some specific guidance to learn how to walk upright, something that humans tend to figure out innately.\nThe AI controls a vaguely humanoid-like creature, albeit with a heavily-simplified body and limbs. It lives in a 3D environment created in the Unity engine, which provides the necessary physics engine for the work. Meanwhile, the ML-Agents package is used to provide the brain for Albert, the AI charged with learning to walk.\nThe video steps through a variety of deep reinforcement learning tasks. In these, the AI is rewarded for completing goals which are designed to teach it how to walk. Albert is given control of his limbs, and simply charged with reaching a button some distance away on the floor. After many trials, he learns to do the worm, and achieves his goal.\nGetting Albert to walk upright took altogether more training. Lumpy ground and walls in between him and his goal were used to up the challenge, as well as encouragements to alternate his use of each foot and to maintain an upright attitude. Over time, he was able to progress through skipping and to something approximating a proper walk cycle.\nOne may argue that the teaching method required a lot of specific guidance, but its still a neat feat to achieve nonetheless. Its altogether more complex than learning to play Trackmania, wed say, and that was impressive enough in itself. Video after the break.\n\n"}

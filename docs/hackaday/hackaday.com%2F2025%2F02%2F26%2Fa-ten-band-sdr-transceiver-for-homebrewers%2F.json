[Bob W7PUA] has tackled both in the form of a portable 10-band multi-mode unit, and we can honestly say hes done a very good job indeed.\nAs you might expect in 2025 its a software defined radio (SDR), but to show how powerful the silicon available today is, its all implemented on a microcontroller. Theres a Teensy 4 with an audio codec board that does all the signal processing heavy lifting, and an RF board that takes care of the I/Q mixing and the analogue stuff.\nBand switching is handled using a technique from the past; interchangeable plug-in coil and filter units, that do an effective job. The result is a modestly-powered but extremely portable rig that doesnt look to have broken the bank, and since the write-up goes into detail on the software side we hope it might inform other SDR projects too. We might have gone for old-school embossed Dymo labels on that brushed aluminium case just for retro appeal, but we cant fault it.\nIts not the first time weve looked at a small multi-band SDR here, but we think this one ups the game somewhat.\nThanks [Pete] for the tip!", "title": "- \u79fb\u52d5\u578b10\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u591a\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "10\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebSDR\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u4fe1\u53f7\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- \u79fb\u52d5\u578b10\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u591a\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa(SDR)\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u5207\u66ff\u6280\u8853", "- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- SDR\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u89e3\u8aac"]}

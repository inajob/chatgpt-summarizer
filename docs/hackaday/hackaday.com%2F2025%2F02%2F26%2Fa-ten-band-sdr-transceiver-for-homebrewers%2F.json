[Bob W7PUA] has tackled both in the form of a portable 10-band multi-mode unit, and we can honestly say hes done a very good job indeed.\nAs you might expect in 2025 its a software defined radio (SDR), but to show how powerful the silicon available today is, its all implemented on a microcontroller. Theres a Teensy 4 with an audio codec board that does all the signal processing heavy lifting, and an RF board that takes care of the I/Q mixing and the analogue stuff.\nBand switching is handled using a technique from the past; interchangeable plug-in coil and filter units, that do an effective job. The result is a modestly-powered but extremely portable rig that doesnt look to have broken the bank, and since the write-up goes into detail on the software side we hope it might inform other SDR projects too. We might have gone for old-school embossed Dymo labels on that brushed aluminium case just for retro appeal, but we cant fault it.\nIts not the first time weve looked at a small multi-band SDR here, but we think this one ups the game somewhat.\nThanks [Pete] for the tip!"}

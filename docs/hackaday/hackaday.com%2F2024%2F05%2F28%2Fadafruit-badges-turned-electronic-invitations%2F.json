Should you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to send out invitations for your big day, or any other major celebration for that matter, you could do worse than follow the example [Mokas] and their partner set with these memorable electronic wedding invitations.\nInspired by the electronic badges distributed at hacker cons, [Mokas] decided to use Adafruit EdgeBadge and PyBadge devices to create a similar interactive keepsake that would be a bit more exciting than a piece of paper. While it would have been enough to have the wedding information pop up on the screen when they were turned on, the final invites actually boot into a retro-style game where you walk around talking to characters to uncover information about the event and the venue.\nThe game was created in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, with a sprinkling of original and commissioned sprites. Early versions of the game ended up being a bit much for the Adafruit badges to handle, but after doing a bit of research on creating games for computationally-constrained platforms, [Mokas] was able to optimize the performance. For those that didnt get a physical invite (no doubt ours was simply lost in the mail), you can play the whole thing right in your browser.\nIts a very clever idea, and while using custom hardware would have allowed for a more bespoke package, we cant blame [Mokas] for wanting to keep this one simple. Getting everything ready for your wedding is already enough stress  its hardly the time to spin up a new board.\nFor a similar reasons, another Adafruit offering was selected to power the couples e-ink baby development display.", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u30a6\u30a7\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u62db\u5f85\u72b6: Adafruit\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528  ", "body": "Hackaday\u8aad\u8005\u3082\u7d50\u5a5a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002[Mokas]\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u30a6\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u62db\u5f85\u72b6\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001Adafruit EdgeBadge\u3068PyBadge\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u7d50\u5a5a\u5f0f\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3002Adafruit\u30bf\u30b0\u304c\u8981\u4ef6\u3092\u6e80\u305f\u3055\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3002\u8981\u6c42\u306b\u5408\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u30a6\u30a7\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u62db\u5f85\u72b6: Adafruit\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528  ", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3: \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30a6\u30a7\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u62db\u5f85\u72b6  ", "Microsoft MakeCode Arcade\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u62db\u5f85\u72b6  ", "Adafruit\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5a5a\u793c\u62db\u5f85\u72b6\u306e\u5236\u4f5c  ", "\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5a5a\u793c\u62db\u5f85\u72b6\u3068e-ink\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4"]}

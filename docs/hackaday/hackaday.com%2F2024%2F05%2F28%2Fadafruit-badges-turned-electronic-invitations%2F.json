Should you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to send out invitations for your big day, or any other major celebration for that matter, you could do worse than follow the example [Mokas] and their partner set with these memorable electronic wedding invitations.\nInspired by the electronic badges distributed at hacker cons, [Mokas] decided to use Adafruit EdgeBadge and PyBadge devices to create a similar interactive keepsake that would be a bit more exciting than a piece of paper. While it would have been enough to have the wedding information pop up on the screen when they were turned on, the final invites actually boot into a retro-style game where you walk around talking to characters to uncover information about the event and the venue.\nThe game was created in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, with a sprinkling of original and commissioned sprites. Early versions of the game ended up being a bit much for the Adafruit badges to handle, but after doing a bit of research on creating games for computationally-constrained platforms, [Mokas] was able to optimize the performance. For those that didnt get a physical invite (no doubt ours was simply lost in the mail), you can play the whole thing right in your browser.\nIts a very clever idea, and while using custom hardware would have allowed for a more bespoke package, we cant blame [Mokas] for wanting to keep this one simple. Getting everything ready for your wedding is already enough stress  its hardly the time to spin up a new board.\nFor a similar reasons, another Adafruit offering was selected to power the couples e-ink baby development display."}

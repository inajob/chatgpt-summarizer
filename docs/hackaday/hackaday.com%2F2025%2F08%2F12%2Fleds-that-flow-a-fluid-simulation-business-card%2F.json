[Nick] adapted this technique into an impressive FLIP business card.\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about this card is its 441 LEDs arranged in a 21\u00d721 matrix. These LEDs are controlled by an Raspberry Pi RP2350, which interfaces with a LIS2DH12TR accelerometer to detect card movement and a small 32Mb memory chip. The centerpiece is a fluid simulation where tilting the card makes the LEDs flow like water in a container. Written in Rust, the firmware implements a FLIP simulation, treating the LEDs as particles in a virtual fluid for a natural, flowing effect.\nThis eye-catching business card uses clever tricks to stay slim. The PCB is just 0.6mm thick\u2014compared to the standard 1.6mm\u2014and the 3.6mm-thick 3.7V battery sits in a cutout to distribute its width across both sides of the board. The USB-C connection for charging and programming uses clever PCB cuts, allowing the plug to slide into place as if in a dedicated connector.\nInspired by a fluid simulation pendant we previously covered, this board is just as eye-catching. Thanks to [Nick] for sharing the design files for this unique business card.

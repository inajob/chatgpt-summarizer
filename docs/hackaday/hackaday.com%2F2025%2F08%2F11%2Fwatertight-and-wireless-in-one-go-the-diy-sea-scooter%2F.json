And thats where [Ben] decided he could, and got to work. On a sea scooter, to be exact.\nThis sea scooter was to be a fully waterproof, hermetically sealed 3D-printed underwater personal propulsion device, with the extreme constraint that the entire hull and mechanical interfaces are printed in one go. No post-printing holes for shafts, connectors, or seals. It also meant [Ben] needed to embed all electronics, motor, magnetic gearbox, custom battery pack, wireless charging, and non-contact magnetic control system inside the print during the actual print process.\nAs [Ben] explains, both Bluetooth and WiFi ranges are laughable once underwater. He elegantly solves this with a reed-switch-based magnetic control system. The non-contact magnetic drive avoids shaft penetrations entirely. Power comes from a custom 8S LiFePO\u2084 pack, charged wirelessly through the hull. Lastly, everythings wrapped in epoxy to make it as watertight as a real submarine.\nThe whole trick of print-in-place is that [Ben] pauses the builder mid-print, and drops in each subsystem like a secret ingredient. Continuing, he tweaks the printers Z-offset, and onwards it goes. Its tense, high-stakes work; a 14-hour print where one nozzle crash means binning hundreds of dollars worth of embedded components.\nStill, [Ben] took the chance, and delivered a cool, fully packed and fully working sea scooter. Comment below to discuss the possibilities of building one yourself.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b8c\u5168\u9632\u6c34\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6d77\u7528\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30d9\u30f3\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9632\u6c34\u306e\u6d77\u7528\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u5168\u3066\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4e00\u5ea6\u306b\u5370\u5237\u3057\u3001\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u78c1\u6c17\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b8c\u5168\u9632\u6c34\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6d77\u7528\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u4e00\u4f53\u6210\u578b\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u78c1\u6c17\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ce\u30f3\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6", "- 14\u6642\u9593\u306e\u9ad8\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u306a\u5370\u5237\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u6d77\u7528\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8b70\u8ad6\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

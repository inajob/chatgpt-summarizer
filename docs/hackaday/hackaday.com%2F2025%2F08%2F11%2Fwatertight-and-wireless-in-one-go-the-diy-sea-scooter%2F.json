And thats where [Ben] decided he could, and got to work. On a sea scooter, to be exact.\nThis sea scooter was to be a fully waterproof, hermetically sealed 3D-printed underwater personal propulsion device, with the extreme constraint that the entire hull and mechanical interfaces are printed in one go. No post-printing holes for shafts, connectors, or seals. It also meant [Ben] needed to embed all electronics, motor, magnetic gearbox, custom battery pack, wireless charging, and non-contact magnetic control system inside the print during the actual print process.\nAs [Ben] explains, both Bluetooth and WiFi ranges are laughable once underwater. He elegantly solves this with a reed-switch-based magnetic control system. The non-contact magnetic drive avoids shaft penetrations entirely. Power comes from a custom 8S LiFePO\u2084 pack, charged wirelessly through the hull. Lastly, everythings wrapped in epoxy to make it as watertight as a real submarine.\nThe whole trick of print-in-place is that [Ben] pauses the builder mid-print, and drops in each subsystem like a secret ingredient. Continuing, he tweaks the printers Z-offset, and onwards it goes. Its tense, high-stakes work; a 14-hour print where one nozzle crash means binning hundreds of dollars worth of embedded components.\nStill, [Ben] took the chance, and delivered a cool, fully packed and fully working sea scooter. Comment below to discuss the possibilities of building one yourself.\n\n"}

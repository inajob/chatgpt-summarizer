Specifically in the area of chemistry, the accessibility of these things have opened up a wide range of possibilities for those immersed in this world, and [Marbs Lab] shows us how to build a glucose-detection lab in an incredibly small form factor.\nThe key to the build is a set of three laser-cut acrylic sheets, which when sandwiched together provide a path for the fluid to flow as well as a chamber that will be monitored by electronic optical sensors. The fluid is pumped through the circuit by a custom-built syringe pump driven by a linear actuator, and when the chamber is filled the reaction can begin. In this case, if the fluid contains glucose it will turn blue, which is detected by the microcontrollers sensors. The color value is then displayed on a small screen mounted to the PCB, allowing the experimenter to take quick readings.\nChemistry labs like this arent limited to one specific reaction, though. The acrylic plates are straightforward to laser cut, so other forms can be made quickly. [Marbs Lab] also made the syringe pump a standalone system, so it can be quickly moved or duplicated for use in other experiments as well. If you want to take your chemistry lab to the extreme, you can even build your own mass spectrometer.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u691c\u51fa\u30e9\u30dc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u6b69\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u5316\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u691c\u51fa\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578b\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u691c\u51fa\u30e9\u30dc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b8\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u6d41\u4f53\u3092\u7ba1\u7406\u3059\u308b", "\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u591a\u7528\u9014\u30e9\u30dc\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9", "DIY\u8cea\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u8a08\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

As long as you accept needing to supply external power with even a low-end GT 1030 card  as the PCI slot cannot provide enough power  and being limited to a single PCIe lane. This latter point isnt so much of an issue as a single PCIe lane offers more bandwidth than the (shared) PCI bus anyway.\nDespite the somewhat improvised setup, the GT 1030 card provided a decent 1080p experience in a range of games, after removing half of the 8 GB of system RAM before the configuration would work, probably due to VRAM mapping issues. Since the mainboard uses also offered PCIe, the same card was run in a PCIe x4 slot, as well as in an x1 configuration, both with noticeably higher performance and putting the why in try.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, a RTX 3080 also booted fine with external power and only 4 GB system RAM installed. Despite the PCIe x1 link, the system was able to finish a 3D benchmark and play Doom 2016, but with only 4 GB of system RAM and an old Athlon quad-core CPU, it was a terrible experience. Perhaps the most fascinating lesson to learn from this is that PCI and PCIe are amazingly compatible with only a simple translation bridge, even if high-performance graphics arent quite what PCI was meant for. After all, thats why we got cursed with AGP for many years.\n\n"}

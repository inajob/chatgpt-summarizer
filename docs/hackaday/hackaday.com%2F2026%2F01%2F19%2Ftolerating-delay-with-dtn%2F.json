You assume network packets either show up pretty quickly or they are never going to show up. Even if you are using WiFi in a crowded sports stadium or LTE on the side of a deserted highway, you probably either have no connection or a fairly robust, although perhaps intermittent, network. But it hasnt always been that way. Radio networks, especially, used to be very hit or miss and, in some cases, still are.\nPerhaps the least reliable network today is one connecting things in deep space. Thats why NASA has a keen interest in Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN). Note that this is the name of a protocol, not just a wish for a certain quality in your network. DTN has been around a while, seen real use, and is available for you to use, too.\nThink about it. On Earth, a long ping time might be 400 ms, and most of that is in equipment, not physical distance. Add a geostationary orbital relay, and you get 600 ms to 800 ms. The moon? The delay is 1.3 sec. Mars? Somewhere between 3 min and 22 min, depending on how far away it is at the moment. Voyager 1? Nearly a two-day round trip. Thats latency!\n\nSo how do you network at these scales? NASAs answer is DTN. It assumes the network will not be present, and when it is, it will be intermittent and slow to respond.\nThis is a big change from TCP. TCP assumes that if packets dont show up, they are lost and does special algorithms to account for the usual cause of lost TCP packets: congestion. That means, typically, they wait longer and longer to retry. But if your packets are not going through because the receiver is behind a planet, this isnt the right approach.\nUpside Down\nDTN nodes operate like a mesh. If you hear something, you may have to act as a relay point even if the message isnt for you. Unlike most store-and-forward networks, though, a DTN node may store a message for hours or even days. Unlike most Earthbound network nodes, a DTN node may be moving. In fact, all of them might be moving. So you cant depend on any given node being able to hear another node, even if they have heard each other in the past.\nIs this new? Hardly. Email is store-and-forward, even if it doesnt seem much like it these days. UUCP and Fidonet had the same basic ideas. If you are a ham radio operator with packet (AX.25) experience, you may see some similarities there, too. But DTN forms a modern and robust network for general purposes and not just a way to send particular types of messages or files.\nThe Bundle Protocol\nWhile the underlying transport layer might use small packets  think TCP  DTN uses bundles, which are large self-contained messages with a good bit of metadata attached. Bundles dont care if they move over TCP, UDP, or some wacky RF protocol. The metadata explains where the data is going, how urgent it is, and at what point you can just give up and discard it. The bundles header has other data, too, such as the length and whether the current bundle is just a fragment of a larger bundle. There are also flags forbidding the fragmentation of a bundle.\nIn Practice\nDTN isnt just a theory. It has been used on the International Space Station and is likely to show up in future missions aimed at the moon and beyond.\nBut even better, DTN implementations exist and are available for anyone to use. NASAs reference implementation is ION (Interplanetary Overlay Network), and it is made for NASA-level safety. It will, though, run on a Raspberry Pi. You can see a training video about ION and DTN in the video below.\n\nThere are some more community-minded implementations like DTN2 and DTN7. If you want to experiment, wed suggest starting with DTN7. The video below can help you get started.\n\nWhy?\nWe hear you. As much as you might like to, you arent sending anything to Mars this week. But DTN is useful anywhere you have unreliable crummy networking. Disaster recovery? Low-power tracking transmitters that die until the sun hits their solar cells? Weak signal links in hostile terrain. All of these use cases could benefit from DTN.\nWe are always surprised that we dont see more DTN in regular applications. It isnt magic, and it doesnt make radios defy the laws of physics. What it does is prevent your network from suffering fatally from those laws when the going gets tough.\nSure. You can do this all on your own.\u00a0 No NASA pun intended, but it isnt rocket science. For specialized cases, you might even be able to do better. After all, UUCP dates back to the late 1970s and shares many of the same features. Remember UUCP schedules that determined when one machine would call another? DTN has contact plans that serve a similar purpose, except that instead of waiting for low long-distance rates, the contact plan is probably waiting for a predicted acquisition of signal time.\nUUCP Redux\nBut otherwise? You knew UUCP wasnt immediate. Routing decisions were often due to expectations of the future. Indefinite storage was all part of the system. Usenet, of course, rode on top of UUCP. So you could think of Usenet as almost a planetary-scale DTN network with messages instead of bundles.\nA Usenet post might take days to show up at a remote site. It might arrive out of order, or twice. DTN has all of these same features. So while some would say DTN is the way of the future, at least in deep space networking, we would submit that DTN is a rediscovery of some very old techniques when networking on Earth was as tenuous as todays space networks.\nSecurity\nWere sure that by modern standards, UUCP had some security flaws. DTN can suffer from some security issues, too. A rogue node can accept bundles and silently kill them, for example. Or flood the network with garbage bundles.\nThen again, TCP DoS or man-in-the-middle attacks are possible, too. You simply have to be careful and think through what you are doing, if it is possible someone will attack your network.\nYour Turn\nSo next time your project needs a rough-and-tumble network that survives even when you arent connected to the gigabit LAN, maybe try DTN. It has come a long way, literally and figuratively, since 2008. Well, actually, since 1997, as you can see in the video below. Whatever you come up with, be sure to send us a tip.\n", "title": "- \u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9045\u5ef6\u8010\u6027\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff08DTN\uff09", "body": "NASA\u306e\u9045\u5ef6\u8010\u6027\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\uff08DTN\uff09\u306f\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9045\u5ef6\u8010\u6027\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff08DTN\uff09", "- DTN\u306e\u57fa\u672c\uff1a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u306a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u4f1d\u9001", "- NASA\u306b\u3088\u308bDTN\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\uff1a\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u6708\u9762\u63a2\u67fb\u307e\u3067", "- DIY\u3067\u8a66\u3059DTN\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aDTN\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

If youre not immediately talking shop, than its probably the time-tested subject of the weather. So what better way to get the conversation started than with a lovely solar-powered circuit sculpture of a business card that displays the weather?\nWe love that the frame has a built-in stand; thats a great touch that really turns this card into something that someone might keep on their desk long-term. The brains of this operation is an ESP32 TTGO E-paper board, which checks the battery voltage first before connecting to Wi-Fi and getting data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the information and then goes to sleep for 15 minutes.\nFor power, [BLANCHARD Jordan] is using a 5 V solar panel and a small battery from an old vape pen. We love to see projects that keep those things out of the landfills, so dont sleep on using them.\nYou have just a few weeks left to enter the 2024 Business Card Challenge, so fire up those soldering irons and get hackin!\n \n\n"}

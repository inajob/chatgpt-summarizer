No worries, [Nate Sales] has your back with his openreactor project, your one-click fusion solution!\nAn inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusor is perhaps the easiest type of fusion for the home gamer, but that\u2019s not the same thing as saying that building and running one is easy. It requires high vacuum, high voltage, and the controlled introduction of deuterium into the chamber. And because it\u2019s real-deal fusion, it\u2019s giving off neutrons, which means that you don\u2019t want to be standing on the wrong side of the lead shielding. This is where remote control is paramount.\nWhile this isn\u2019t an automation problem that many people will be having, to put it lightly, it\u2019s awesome that [Nate] shared his solution with us all. Sure, if you\u2019re running a different turbo pump or flow controller, you might have some hacking to do, but at least you\u2019ve got a start. And if you\u2019re simply curious about fusion on a hobby scale, his repo is full of interesting details, from the inside.\nAnd while this sounds far out, fusion at home is surprisingly attainable. Heck, if a 12-year old or even a YouTuber can do it, so can you! And now the software shouldn\u2019t stand in your way.\nThanks [Anon] for the tip!"}

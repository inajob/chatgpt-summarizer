Now, you might not get a perfect print  and neither did [Atul R]. Not to worry, because if you have a 3D printer handy, hes showing you how to design a 3D-printed frame using Blender and TinkerCAD, making your solder paste print well even if youre trying to rest a giant stencil on top of a tiny board.\n[Atul]s situation was non-characteristic  the project is a 2mm thick PCB designed to plug right into a USB port, so the usual trick of using some scrap PCBs wouldnt work, and using a 3D-printed frame turned out to be key. To get it done, he exported a .wrl from KiCad, processed it in Blender, and then designed a frame with help of TinkerCAD. These techniques, no doubt, will translate into your CAD of choice  especially if you go with .step export instead of .wrl.\nThis kind of frame design will get you far, especially for boards where the more common techniques fail  say, if you need to assemble a double-sided board and one side is already populated. Dont have a stencil? You could surely make a 3D printed stencil, too, both for KiCad boards and for random Gerber files. Oh, and dont forget this 3D-printable stencil alignment jig, while youre at it  looks like it ought to save you quite a bit of trouble."}

In the case of Ankers Prime Charging Station it turns out that its actually not too terrible at controlling the game, as [Aaron Christophel] demonstrates. Unlike the similar Anker power bank product with BLE and a big display that we previously covered, this device has quite the capable hardware inside.\nPlaying a quick game of DOOM\u00a0while waiting for charging to finish. (Credit: Aaron Christophel, YouTube)\nAccording to [Aaron], inside this charging station youll not only find an ESP32-C3 for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) duty, but also a 150 MHz Synwit SWM341RET7 (Chinese datasheet) ARM-based MCU along with 16 MB of external flash and 8 MB of external RAM. Both of these are directly mapped into the MCUs memory space. The front display has a 200480 pixel resolution.\nThis Synwit MCU is a bit of a curiosity, as it uses ARM Chinas Star-MC1 architecture most of the information on it is in Chinese, though its clear that it implements the ARMv8-M profile. It can also be programmed the typical way, which is what [Aaron] did to get DOOM on it, with the clicky encoder on the side of the charging station being the sole control input.\nAs can be seen in the video it makes for a somewhat awkward playing experience, but far more usable than one might expect, even if running full-screen proved to be a bit too much for the hardware.\n\n", "title": "- DOOM\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u308bAnker\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "Anker\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u3067DOOM\u304c\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u826f\u597d\u3067\u3001\u5145\u96fb\u4e2d\u306b\u904a\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- DOOM\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u308bAnker\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- \u5145\u96fb\u4e2d\u306b\u904a\u3076\uff01Anker Prime Charging Station", "- ARM\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eMCU\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5145\u96fb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01DOOM\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5185\u90e8", "- \u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

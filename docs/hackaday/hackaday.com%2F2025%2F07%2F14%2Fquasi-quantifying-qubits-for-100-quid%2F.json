Once disturbed, the protons nutate (a fancy physics word for wobble), and flip quantum spin states. [skywo1f]s NMR device can detect these spin state changes, as he demonstrates with a series of control experiments designed to eliminate sources of false positives (which can be annoyingly prevalent in experimental physics). His newest experimental device includes a number of improvements over previous iterations, including proper shielding, quieter power topology, and better coil winding in the core of the device. Everything was assembled with cost in mind, while remaining sensitive enough to conduct experiments  the whole thing is even driven by a Raspberry Pi Pico.\nHere at Hackaday, we love to see experiments that should be happening in million-dollar laboratories chugging along on kitchen tables, like this magnetohydrodynamic drive system or some good old-fashioned PCB etching. [skywo1f]\u00a0doesnt seem to be running any quantum calculations yet, but the NMR device is an important building block in one flavor of quantum computer, so were excited to see where he takes his work next."}

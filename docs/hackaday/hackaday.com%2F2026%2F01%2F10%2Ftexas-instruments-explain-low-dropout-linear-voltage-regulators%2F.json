In this video [Alex Hanson] from Texas Instruments runs us through the linear voltage regulators known as low-dropout regulators (LDOs). It turns out that LDOs are often a poor choice for voltage regulation because they are inefficient when compared to switching regulator alternatives and can be more expensive too.\nSo when might you use an LDO? In very low power situations where heat and efficiency doesnt matter very much. LDOs operate best when the input voltage is very near the output voltage and when current demands are low (roughly speaking less than ~50 mA is okay, ~500 mA is maximum, and some applications will support 1 to 3 A, although not with great efficiency and in this case thermal emissions \u2014 or magic smoke! \u2014 will become an issue).\nWhat LDOs bring to the table is relatively clean and low-noise voltage as well as low dropout voltage (the minimum difference between the input and output voltage needed for regulation), which is their defining feature. Whats more with an appropriate output capacitor they can react quickly to load changes and they usually emit minimal EMI. LDOs are not about efficiency, they are about quality, simplicity, and control.\nYou might like to read more about when linear regulators might be the right choice or what your other options are.\n\n", "title": "- LDO\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "body": "Texas Instruments\u304cLDO\u7dda\u5f62\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u9650\u754c\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u7528\u9014\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3001\u54c1\u8cea\u91cd\u8996\u3002", "titles": ["- LDO\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u4f4e\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u52b9\u7387\u3088\u308a\u3082\u54c1\u8cea\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3059\u308bLDO\u306e\u7279\u6027", "- LDO\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306e\u9069\u5207\u306a\u96fb\u6d41\u3068\u71b1\u7ba1\u7406", "- \u9759\u97f3\u6027\u3068\u5236\u5fa1\u6027\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305fLDO\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

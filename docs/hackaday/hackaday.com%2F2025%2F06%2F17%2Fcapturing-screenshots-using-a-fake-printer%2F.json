Back when they were made it was common to record oscilloscope screens with a Polaroid camera, that would have a front fitting for just this purpose.\nMore recent instruments are computerized so taking a screen shot should be easier, but thats still not easy if the machine cant save to a handy disk. Along comes [Tom] with a solution, to hook up a fake printer, and grab the screen from a print.\nOld instruments come with a variety of ports, serial, IEE-488, or parallel, but they should usually have the ability to print a screen. Then capturing that is a case of capturing an interpreting the print data, be it ESC/P, PCL5, Postscript, or whatever. The linked page takes us through a variety of techniques, and should be of help to anyone whos picked up a bargain in the flea market.\nThis isnt the only time weve touched on the subject of bringing older computerized equipment into the present, weve also shown you a disk drive emulator.\nThanks [JohnU] for the tip.", "title": "\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306eCRT\u753b\u9762\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u507d\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u5370\u5237\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u304c\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306eCRT\u753b\u9762\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u65e7\u578b\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u53e4\u3044\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u753b\u9762\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853", "\u53e4\u3044\u8a08\u6e2c\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

Back when they were made it was common to record oscilloscope screens with a Polaroid camera, that would have a front fitting for just this purpose.\nMore recent instruments are computerized so taking a screen shot should be easier, but thats still not easy if the machine cant save to a handy disk. Along comes [Tom] with a solution, to hook up a fake printer, and grab the screen from a print.\nOld instruments come with a variety of ports, serial, IEE-488, or parallel, but they should usually have the ability to print a screen. Then capturing that is a case of capturing an interpreting the print data, be it ESC/P, PCL5, Postscript, or whatever. The linked page takes us through a variety of techniques, and should be of help to anyone whos picked up a bargain in the flea market.\nThis isnt the only time weve touched on the subject of bringing older computerized equipment into the present, weve also shown you a disk drive emulator.\nThanks [JohnU] for the tip."}

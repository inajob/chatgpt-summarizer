[Pierre-Loup M.]s One Hertz Sculpture\u00a0 has no pretensions of being anything but pretty, but we can absolutely respect the artistic impulse behind it.\nThe sculpture is a free-form circuit inside of a picture frame. There are 9 LEDs in a ring with a few other components to produce a reverse-chase effect (one going dark at a time) taking about 1 second to circle the sculpture. As far as free-form circuit art goes, its handsomely done, but as this is Hackaday its probably the electronics, rather that the aesthetics that are of interest.\nThe circuit is an example of a ring oscillator: a cascading chain of NOT gates, endlessly feeding into and inverting one\nWithout timing it, it looks like 1 Hz, even if we know its not.\nanother. The NOT gates are implemented in resistor-transistor logic with 2N3904 NPN transistors, nine in total. Of course the inverter delay of this sort of handmade logic gate is far too fast for an aesthetically pleasing (or visible) chase, so some extra circuitry is needed to slow down the oscillations to something less than the 5 MHz it would naturally do. This is affected by pairing every transistor with an RC oscillator. Ideally the RC oscillator would have a 0.111..s period (1/9th of a second), but a few things got in the way of that. The RC oscillator isnt oscillating in a vacuum, and interactions with the rest of the circuit have it running just a little bit fast. Thats really of no matter; a simple oscillator circuit like this wasnt going to be a shoe in for the accuracy-based Time Lords category of this contest. As a sculpture and not a clock, youre not going to notice it isnt running at exactly 1Hz. (Though a ring-oscillator based clock would be a sight indeed.)\nWeve seen ring oscillators before, including inside the venerable 8087 coprocessor and this delightfully romantic beating-heart gift, but this is the first one that seems to have entered the One Hertz Challenge.\nIf you have a hankering for hertz, the contest is still open, but youd better get ticking! The contest closes August 19th.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a1\u30d8\u30eb\u30c4\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u300cOne Hertz Challenge\u300d\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u5f6b\u523b\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002 ", "titles": ["- \u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a1\u30d8\u30eb\u30c4\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u81ea\u4f5cLED\u56de\u8def\u3067\u9b45\u305b\u308b\u9006\u30c1\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u52b9\u679c", "- \u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055", "- 1\u30d8\u30eb\u30c4\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3078\u306e\u53c2\u52a0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u7de0\u5207\u60c5\u5831"]}

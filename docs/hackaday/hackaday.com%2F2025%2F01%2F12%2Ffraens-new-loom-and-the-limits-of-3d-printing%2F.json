But with this nearly completely 3D-printable needle loom, hes pushing right up against the edge of the possible.\nThe needle loom is a lot like the flying shuttle loom that started the Industrial Revolution, except for making belts or ribbons. Its certainly among the most complex 3D-printed machines that weve ever seen, and [Fraens] himself says that it is pushing the limits of whats doable in plastic  for more consistent webbing, hed make some parts out of metal. But thats quibbling; this thing is amazing.\nThere are mechanical details galore here. For instance, check out the cam-chain that raises, holds, and lowers arms to make the pattern. Equally important are the adjustable friction brakes on the rollers that hold the warp, that create a controlled constant tension on the strings.\u00a0 (Dont ask us, we had to Wikipedia it!) We can see that design coming in handy in some of our own projects.\nOn the aesthetic front, the simple but consistent choice of three colors for gears, arms, and frame make the build look super tidy. And the accents of two-color printing on the end caps is just the cherry on the top.\nThis is no small project, with eight-beds-worth of printed parts, plus all the screws, bearings, washers, etc. The models are for pay, but if youre going to actually make this, thats just a tiny fraction of the investment, and we think its going to a good home.\nWe are still thinking of making [Fraens]s vibratory rock tumbler design, but check out all of his work if youre interested in nice 3D-printed mechanical designs.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30cb\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u7e54\u6a5f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Fraens\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u91dd\u7e54\u6a5f\u306f\u3001\u5de5\u696d\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30cb\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u7e54\u6a5f\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- Fraens\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u3080\u6a5f\u68b0\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305f\u7e54\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42", "- Fraens\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u4f5c\u54c1\u96c6\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

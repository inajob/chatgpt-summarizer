He wants it to be accurate down to the dates on the chips. It is quite an impressive build.\u00a0 The problem is the crystal. OSI used large crystals, even by early 1980s standards. The crystal is in a large can with thick pins, like something youd expect to find in old radio equipment. The problem is that this crystal package isnt made anymore.\u00a0\nThe crystal had to be exactly 3.932160 MHz, and while [Empire] has a huge collection of vintage crystals, he didn\u2019t have the right one from the 70s. He did, however, have that value in a modern crystal.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe solution? Hide the new crystal in the can of an older one. The only problem is that crystals are sealed. The bottom appeared to be some sort of plastic or resin.\u00a0 Gong after it with a side cutter, [Empire] realized it was glass!\u00a0 Thankfully, none of it got in his eyes, though his hands may have taken a bit of a beating.\u00a0\nWith the old crystals shell hollowed out, [Empire] installed the modern device and potted everything in resin. The transplant worked. Now, all that\u2019s left is to fire up the OSI and start hacking.\u00a0\nWant to build a replica computer but dont want to hunt down the parts? Check out [Taylor] and [Amys] build of this minipet. Regardless of the size of the case, crystals all work in the same way.\n\n", "title": "OSI\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9II\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306eOhio Scientific (OSI) Superboard II\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u304c\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u5185\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u3092\u96a0\u3057\u3001\u6210\u529f\u3092\u53ce\u3081\u305f\u3002\u8981\u306f\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5fa9\u523b\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["OSI\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9II\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u5927\u578b\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u30ab\u30f3\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4ed5\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u307f\u305f", "OSI\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u53d6\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u3000"]}

In particular that membrane keyboard was notorious for its lack of feedback, and a popular upgrade back in the day was a replacement keyboard. Now we can bring you what might be the ultimate in ZX replacement keyboards, in the form of [Brian Swetland]s mechanical ZX81 keyboard.\nThe familiar 40-key layout is all there, using Cherry MX key switches and a beautiful set of custom-printed keycaps. Theres little more to a ZX keyboard than the matrix wiring, and in this case its all incorporated on a PCB. None of these techniques were readily available to individuals back in the 80s, so a large piece of perfboard, key switches from an old terminal keyboard, and Letraset would have had to suffice.\nWe have to admit liking this project a lot, in fact were even tempted by a set of these keycaps for a regular keyboard just for old times sake. If youre interested in the ZX81 then take a look at how we used one to help us through the pandemic."}

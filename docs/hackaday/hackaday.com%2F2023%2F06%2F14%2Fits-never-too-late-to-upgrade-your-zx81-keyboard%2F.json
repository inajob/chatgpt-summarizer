In particular that membrane keyboard was notorious for its lack of feedback, and a popular upgrade back in the day was a replacement keyboard. Now we can bring you what might be the ultimate in ZX replacement keyboards, in the form of [Brian Swetland]s mechanical ZX81 keyboard.\nThe familiar 40-key layout is all there, using Cherry MX key switches and a beautiful set of custom-printed keycaps. Theres little more to a ZX keyboard than the matrix wiring, and in this case its all incorporated on a PCB. None of these techniques were readily available to individuals back in the 80s, so a large piece of perfboard, key switches from an old terminal keyboard, and Letraset would have had to suffice.\nWe have to admit liking this project a lot, in fact were even tempted by a set of these keycaps for a regular keyboard just for old times sake. If youre interested in the ZX81 then take a look at how we used one to help us through the pandemic.", "title": "ZX81\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "ZX81\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u4e0d\u8db3\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u6539\u826f\u7248\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002Cherry MX\u30ad\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u5370\u5237\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["ZX81\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "ZX81\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3057\u305f\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3092\u653e\u3064\u3001ZX81\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "Cherry MX\u30ad\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f\u3001\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306aZX81\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "ZX81\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u6717\u5831\uff01\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834"]}

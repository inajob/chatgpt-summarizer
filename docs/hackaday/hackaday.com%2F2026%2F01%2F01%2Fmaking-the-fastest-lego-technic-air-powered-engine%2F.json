After first building a simple air-powered piston engine, this time around [Jamies Brick Jams] sought to not only optimize the engine, but also build a clutch and something to power with said engine.\nThe four-piston design in radial configuration.\nThe piston head is one of the handful of 3D printed parts, with the new design featuring twin rubber o-rings as a seal instead of a single big one as in the old design. This incidentally matches the multiple seal rings on an internal combustion engines pistons, probably for similar blow-by related reasons. The air hose diameter was also increased from 2 to 3 mm to give the engine a larger volume of air to work with, which along with a new flywheel gave a lot more torque. Next the piston rod length was optimized.\nThe final radial 4-piston engine turns out to work pretty well, with the clutch engaging smoothly. This was used to drive a DIY generator that turned out to produce about 3 Watt of usable power in its final configuration at 6 V, though its admittedly a rather crude generator that could be further optimized. When trying a twin-piston configuration with the highest air pressure before air hoses began to pop off, it hit a dizzying 14,600 RPM.\nThese arent half bad results for some LEGO Technic together with some 3D printed bits, rubber o-rings and some lube.\n\n", "title": "- LEGO\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7a7a\u6c17\u52d5\u529b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6700\u9069\u5316", "body": "LEGO Technic\u3067\u7a7a\u6c17\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u9ad8\u56de\u8ee2\u306b\u9054\u3059\u308b\u6210\u679c\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- LEGO\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7a7a\u6c17\u52d5\u529b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u6700\u9069\u5316", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u30ec\u30b4\u304b\u3089\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3068\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30ec\u30b4\u306e4\u6c17\u7b52\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8", "- DIY\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u30ec\u30b4\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

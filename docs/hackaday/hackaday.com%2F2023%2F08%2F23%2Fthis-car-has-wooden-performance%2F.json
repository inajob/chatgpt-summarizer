A few might be aluminium and fewer still composite materials, but by and large thats it for automotive structures. This hasnt stopped the inventive Russians at [Garage 54] from experimenting though, and in their latest theyve made a car with a chassis made of wood. Not carefully sawn and assembled wooden structural components, oh no. These are wooden tree trunks and branches.\nOf course its an opportunity for them to run wild on their very successful schtick of the crazy Eastern European YouTuber, but behind that its entertaining to watch how they adapt a drive train  taken were guessing from the FIAT 124-derived Zhiguli, or Lada as most of us would know it  to such an unconventional chassis. A lot of wire binding is used, and even then the car has a lot of the flexible about it. Were not so sure about the differential without oil or indeed the front suspension that appears to be developing a lean, but they do manage to take it out of the forest and onto the road.\nAre unconventional and definitely-not-road-legal motors your thing? Heres another, courtesy of some Dutch lads.\n\n", "title": "\u6728\u88fd\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306e\u8eca\u3092\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306eGarage 54\u304c\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e[Garage 54]\u304c\u6728\u88fd\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306e\u8eca\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8124\u7531\u6765\u306e\u30b8\u30b0\u30ea\u3084\u30e9\u30fc\u30c0\u306e\u99c6\u52d5\u7cfb\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3001\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u3067\u88dc\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u524d\u30b5\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u50be\u304d\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u68ee\u304b\u3089\u9053\u8def\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002\u7570\u4f8b\u306e\u8eca\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u6728\u88fd\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306e\u8eca\u3092\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306eGarage 54\u304c\u5236\u4f5c", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8124\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u99c6\u52d5\u7cfb\u7d71\u3092\u6728\u88fd\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306b\u9069\u5fdc\u3055\u305b\u305f", "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306eYouTuber\u304c\u6728\u88fd\u8eca\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u516c\u958b", "\u30aa\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u306a\u3044\u30c7\u30d5\u3084\u524d\u30b5\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc", "\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u82e5\u8005\u306b\u3088\u308b\u975e\u5408\u6cd5\u306a\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u3082\u53c2\u8003\u306b"]}

Somehow, we live in a world where there are people nostalgic for Big Blue. Thats why [AnneBarela] built a miniature IBM PC using an Adafruit Fruit Jam board.\nIf you havent seen it before, the Fruit Jam board is an RP2350 dev board created specifically to make minicomputers, with its two USB host sockets, DVI-out and 3.5mm jack. [Anne] loaded a PC emulator by [Daft-Freak] called PACE-32 than can emulate an IBM compatible PC with an 80386 and up-to 8 MB of RAM on this particular board. The video is VGA, 640480  as god intended piped to a 5 LCD [Anne] picked up from AliExpress.\nThat display is mounted inside a replica monitor designed by [giobbino], and is sitting on top of a replica case. Both are available on Thingiverse, though some modification was required to provide proper mounting for the Fruit Jam board. [giobbino] designed it to house a FabGL ESP32 module which has us wondering, if an RP2350 can be a 386, what level of PC might the ESP32-P4 be capable of? Weve seen it pretend to be a Quadra, so a 486 should be possible. It wasnt that long ago that mini builds of this nature required a Raspberry Pi, after all.\nSpeculation aside, this diminutive IBM build leaves us but with but one question: if you played Links386 on it, would it count as miniature golf?"}

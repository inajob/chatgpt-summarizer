(Credit: electronupdate, YouTube)\nWith the ESP32-P4 not having any wireless functionality and instead focusing on being a small SoC, it makes sense to combine it with a second chip that handles features like WiFi and Bluetooth. This makes the Guition ESP32-P4-M3 module both a pretty good example of how the P4 will be used, and an excellent opportunity to tear into, decap and shoot photos of the dies of both the P4 and the ESP32-C6 in this particular module, courtesy of [electronupdate]. There also the blog post for those who just want to ogle the shinies.\nAfter popping the metal shield on the module, you can see the contents as in the above photo. The P4 inside is a variant with 32 MB of PSRAM integrated along with the SoC die. This results in a die shot both of this PSRAM and the P4 die, though enough of the top metal seems to remain to clearly see the latter.\nThe Boya brand Flash chip is quite standard inside, and along with a glance at the inside of one of the crystal oscillators we get to glance at the inside of the C6 MCU. This is a much more simple chip than the P4, with the RF section quite obvious. The total die sizes are 2.7 x 2.7 mm for the C6 and 4.29 x 3.66 mm for the P4.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32-P4\u3068ESP32-C6\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "ESP32-P4\u306f\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001ESP32-C6\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32-P4\u3068ESP32-C6\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- Guition ESP32-P4-M3\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "- ESP32\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306eRF\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u6df1\u6398\u308a\u3059\u308b", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3001ESP32-P4\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u7279\u9577", "- PSRAM\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fESP32-P4\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u5206\u6790"]}

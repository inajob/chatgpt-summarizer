The only drawback to this new filter was that its controls were located near his feet. Rather than kicking at his new equipment, he devised a way to automate it.\nBy adding a Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller running ESPHome, a relay board, and a small AC-to-DC transformer, [Ryan] can now control the single push button used to cycle through speed settings wirelessly. Including the small transformer inside was a clever touch, as it allows the unit to require only a single power cable while keeping all the newfound smarts hidden inside.\nThe relay controls the button in parallel, so the physical button still works. Now that the extractor is integrated with Home Assistant, he can automate it. The fan can be controlled via his phone, but even better, he automated it to turn on by monitoring the power draw on the smart outlet his soldering iron is plugged into. When he turns on his iron, the fume extractor automatically kicks in.\nCheck out some other great automations weve featured that take over mundane tasks."}

If youre a big fan of the OG, youre probably already drowning in Iron Man helmets and arc reactor doo-dads, but heres one more for you. After all, you probably dont have an arc reactor clock yet.\nThe build comes to us from [jerome95]. It starts with an off-the-shelf ring of addressable LEDs, which serves as the basic defining dimension for the project. The ring gets a 3D printed support structure and some non-functional copper coils to complete the basic arc reactor look. Inside the center sits a small 7-segment display which displays the time under the command of an ESP32. It uses a network time server so its always on the dot.\u00a0 Meanwhile, if youre not a fan of the 7-segment version, you can always try the OLED variant of the build instead.\nIts not a complicated build; that could have been easily achieved, though. The builder could have displayed the time by making the LEDs flash different colors, instead of using a 7-segment display. However, that would have made a far more confounding clock. As it is, this design would make an excellent gift for any Marvel fan. Particularly those that acknowledge the supremacy of the film that started it all.\n\n"}

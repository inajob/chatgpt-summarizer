[Cliff] of might have the answer for you, in the form of 3D printed bearings with filament rollers.\nWith the exception of the raw filament rollers, the inner and outer race, roller cage and cap are all printed. It would also be possible to design some of the components right into a rotating assembly.[Cliff] makes it clear this experiment isn\u2019t about replacing metal bearings\u2014far from it. Instead, its an inquiry into how self-sufficient one can be with a FDM 3D printer. That didnt stop him from torture testing the design to its limits as wheel bearings on an off-road go-cart. The first version wasnt well supported against axial loads, and ripped apart during some more enthusiastic maneuvers.\n[Cliff] improved it with a updated inner race and some 3D printed washers, which held up to 30 minutes of riding with only minimal signs of wear. He also made a slightly more practical 10mm OD version that fits over and M3 bolt, and all the design files are downloadable for free. Cutting the many pieces of filament to length quickly turned into a chore, so a simple cutting jig is also included.\nLet us know in the comments below where you think these would be practical. Weve covered some other 3D printed bearing that use printed races, as well as a slew bearing thats completely 3D printed.\n"}

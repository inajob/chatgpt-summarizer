That didnt stop [Kamil Wolnikowski] and [Piotr K\u00f3zka] from hacking together Grey a ray-cast first-person shooter for the Commodore 64.\nGrey bares more than a passing resemblance to id-softwares most-ported project. It apparently runs at 16 frames per second on a vanilla C64  no super CPU required. The secret to the speedy game play is the engines clever use of the systems color mapping functionality: updating color maps is faster than redrawing the screen. Yeah, that makes for rather blockier graphics than DOOM, but this is running on a Commodore 64, not a 386 with 4 MB of RAM. Allowances must be made. Come to think of it, we dont recall DOOM running this smooth on the minimum required hardware  check out the demo video below and let us know what you think.\nThe four-level demo currently available is about 175 kB, which certainly seems within the realms of possibility for disk games using the trusty 1541. Of course nowadays we do have easier ways to get games onto our vintage computers.\nIf youre thinking about Commodores other home computer, it did eventually get a DOOM-clone.\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "- Commodore 64\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fDOOM\u98a8\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cGrey\u300d", "body": "C64\u7528\u306e\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cGrey\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002DOOM\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u5185\u5bb9\u3067\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["- Commodore 64\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fDOOM\u98a8\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cGrey\u300d", "- \u300cGrey\u300d\uff1a\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306eC64\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u305f\u306a FPS \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- C64\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3057\u305f\uff01 \u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "- 175KB\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01C64\u5411\u3051\u300cGrey\u300d\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4ef2\u9593\u5165\u308a\uff01C64\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

Particularly the system was developed by [David Wong] as a part of his PhD thesis: The design and construction of the digital computers snocom, nimbus and arcturus (PDF). [David] worked in collaboration with [Kevin R. Rosolen] who is interviewed in the video.\n\nThe machine is described as a fixed-point, binary, parallel, single address, general-purpose digital computer using packaged diode-transistor circuits. Ferrite-core memory was used instead of drum memory because drum memory was too slow and performance was a high priority feature. For the same reason parallel features were implemented where serial might have been done more simply, if it hadnt been so slow. In addition to the ferrite-core there were paper-tape peripherals and control panels.\nThe machine supported 32 distinct instructions and had a 13-bit address space allowing it to directly address 8,192 words, each word comprising 20-bits. Those word bits were one sign bit and nineteen magnitude bits for fixed-point twos complement binary numbers.\nWe covered The Computer History of Australia by [State of Electronics] back when they released their 5th video in the series, Australia\u2019s Silliac Computer, if youre interested in more history of computing in Australia.\n"}

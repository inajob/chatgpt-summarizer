Particularly the system was developed by [David Wong] as a part of his PhD thesis: The design and construction of the digital computers snocom, nimbus and arcturus (PDF). [David] worked in collaboration with [Kevin R. Rosolen] who is interviewed in the video.\n\nThe machine is described as a fixed-point, binary, parallel, single address, general-purpose digital computer using packaged diode-transistor circuits. Ferrite-core memory was used instead of drum memory because drum memory was too slow and performance was a high priority feature. For the same reason parallel features were implemented where serial might have been done more simply, if it hadnt been so slow. In addition to the ferrite-core there were paper-tape peripherals and control panels.\nThe machine supported 32 distinct instructions and had a 13-bit address space allowing it to directly address 8,192 words, each word comprising 20-bits. Those word bits were one sign bit and nineteen magnitude bits for fixed-point twos complement binary numbers.\nWe covered The Computer History of Australia by [State of Electronics] back when they released their 5th video in the series, Australia\u2019s Silliac Computer, if youre interested in more history of computing in Australia.\n", "title": "\u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30fc\u5927\u5b66\u306eARCTURUS: 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "body": "ARCTURUS\u306f1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30fc\u5927\u5b66\u3067\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30021975\u5e74\u307e\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u300132\u306e\u547d\u4ee4\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30fc\u5927\u5b66\u306eARCTURUS: 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fARCTURUS\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9032\u5316: ARCTURUS\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u53f2\u3092\u63a2\u308b: ARCTURUS\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "\u30d1\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fARCTURUS\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u9769\u65b0"]}

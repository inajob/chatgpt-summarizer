A PCs BIOS knows how to set up the different hardware devices, grab a fixed part of a hard drive, load it, and run it. Thats all you need. While it might be all you need, it isnt everything people want, so a consortium developed UEFI, which can do all the things a normal BIOS cant. Among other things, UEFI can load code for the operating system over the network instead of from the hard drive.\nIn true hacker fashion, [Phillip Tennen] thought, Does it have to be an operating system? The answer, of course, is no. It could be an IRC client.\u00a0He chose Rust to implement everything. While UEFI does provide a network stack, it isnt very easy to use, apparently. It also provides support for a mouse. [Phillip] ported his GUI toolkit library over, and then the rest is just building an IRC client.\nThe client isnt the easiest to use because, after all, this is a lark. Why would you want to do this? On the other hand, we can think of reasons we might want to take control of a UEFI motherboard and use it for something. If you want to do that, this project is a great template to jump-start your endeavors.\nWeve looked at the UEFI system a few times. Or, you can use it to play DOOM.\n\n"}

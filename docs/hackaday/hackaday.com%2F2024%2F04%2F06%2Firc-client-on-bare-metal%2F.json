A PCs BIOS knows how to set up the different hardware devices, grab a fixed part of a hard drive, load it, and run it. Thats all you need. While it might be all you need, it isnt everything people want, so a consortium developed UEFI, which can do all the things a normal BIOS cant. Among other things, UEFI can load code for the operating system over the network instead of from the hard drive.\nIn true hacker fashion, [Phillip Tennen] thought, Does it have to be an operating system? The answer, of course, is no. It could be an IRC client.\u00a0He chose Rust to implement everything. While UEFI does provide a network stack, it isnt very easy to use, apparently. It also provides support for a mouse. [Phillip] ported his GUI toolkit library over, and then the rest is just building an IRC client.\nThe client isnt the easiest to use because, after all, this is a lark. Why would you want to do this? On the other hand, we can think of reasons we might want to take control of a UEFI motherboard and use it for something. If you want to do that, this project is a great template to jump-start your endeavors.\nWeve looked at the UEFI system a few times. Or, you can use it to play DOOM.\n\n", "title": "BIOS\u304b\u3089UEFI\u3078\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "BIOS\u306e\u5f8c\u7d99\u6280\u8853UEFI\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066IRC\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002UEFI\u306b\u306f\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3084\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5099\u308f\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Rust\u3067\u5b9f\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306fUEFI\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7528\u9014\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3002UEFI\u3067DOOM\u3082\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["BIOS\u304b\u3089UEFI\u3078\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Rust\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fUEFI\u3067\u306eIRC\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a", "UEFI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "UEFI\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\uff1a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "UEFI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067DOOM\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd"]}

For [Teddy Warner], though, its more applicable to a little printer he whipped up to record the very best banter from his cadre of friends.\n[Teddys] idea was simple. He hoped to capture amusing or interesting quotes his friends made in his apartment, and store them in a more permanent form. He also wanted to allow his friends to do the same. To that end, he whipped up a small locally-hosted web interface which his friends could use to record quotes, along with proper attribution. Hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5, the web interface can then truck those quotes out to an 80 mm thermal receipt printer. The anecdote, epithet, or witticism is then spat out with a timestamp in a format roughly approximating a receipt you might get from your local gas station. Whats neat is that [Teddy] was also able to install the entire system within the housing of the Miemieyo receipt printer, by 3D printing a custom base that could house the Pi and a suitable power supply.\nBeyond being fun, this system also serves a critical purpose. It creates a paper trail, such that in-jokes, rumors, and insults alike can be traced back to their originating source. No more can Crazy Terry claim to have invented the Malaga bit, because the server and the receipt clearly log that Gerald dropped it first at the Boxing Day do.\nWeve seen similar projects before, too. Theres just something neat about holding a bit of paper in your hand.\n\n", "title": "- \u53cb\u9054\u306e\u540d\u8a00\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "\u53cb\u4eba\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u767a\u8a00\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53cb\u9054\u306e\u540d\u8a00\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30e9\u30ba\u30d1\u30a4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30d0\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u8a18\u9332\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u7b11\u3044\u3092\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0\u3092\u6b8b\u3059\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

TPU is a flexible filament whereas PLA is hard almost to the point of being brittle. The combo results in a filament with some unusual properties, inviting some thoughts about what else is possible.\nCross-section of 3D print using white PLA with a red TPU core.\n[Stefan]s video covers a few different filament experiments, but if youd like to see the TPU-PLA composite you can skip ahead to 18:15. He first creates the composite filament by printing an oversized version on a 3D printer, then re-forming it by running it through a Recreator to resize it down to 1.75 mm.\nWe have seen this technique of printing custom filaments before, which is useful to create DIY multi-color filaments in small quantities right on a 3D printers print bed with no special equipment required. This is an effective method but results in filament with a hexagonal profile, which works but isnt really ideal. By printing his custom composite at 4 mm diameter then resizing the filament down to 1.75 mm, [Stefan] was able to improve overall printability.\nThat being said, TPU and PLA have very different characteristics and dont like to adhere to one another so the process was pretty fiddly. TPU-cored PLA might be troublesome and uncooperative to make, but it can be done with some patience and fairly simple equipment.\nDespite the difficulties, test prints were pretty interesting. PLA toughness was roughly doubled and under magnification one can see a lattice of TPU strands throughout the prints which are unlike anything else. Check it out in the video, embedded below.\n\n"}

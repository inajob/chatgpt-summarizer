One of our friends lived near a University, and they even had a summer program that would help you measure your mirrors and ensure you had a successful build. But most of us never ground mirrors from glass blanks and did all the other arcane steps required to make a working telescope. However, [La3emedimension] wants to tempt us again with a 3D-printable telescope kit.\nBefore you fire up the 3D printer, be aware that PLA is not recommended, and, of course, you are going to need some extra parts. There is supposed to be a README with a bill of parts, but we didnt see it. However, there is a support page in French and a Discord server, so we have no doubt it can be found.\n\nIt is possible to steal the optics from another telescope or, of course, buy new. You probably dont want to grind your own mirrors, although good on you if you do! You can even buy the entire kit if you dont want to print it and gather all the parts yourself.\nThe scope is made to be ultra-portable, and it looks like it would be a great travel scope. Let us know if you build one or a derivative.\nThis telescope looks much different than other builds weve seen. If you want to do it all old school, weve seen a great guide.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u5225\u9014\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u643a\u5e2f\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u65c5\u884c\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u671b\u9060\u93e1\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u5922\u304c\u518d\u71c3\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1", "- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a3D\u5370\u5237\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046", "- \u671b\u9060\u93e1\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3068\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9"]}

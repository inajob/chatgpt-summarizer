All that waste heat has to go somewhere, and while plenty of us are content to add fans and heat sinks for a passable air-cooled system there are others who prefer a liquid cooling solution of some sort. [Cal] uses a liquid cooler on his system, but when he upgraded his AMD chip to one with double the number of cores he noticed the cooling fans on the radiator were ramping quickly and often. To solve this problem he turned to Python instead of building a new cooling system.\nThe reason for the rapid and frequent fan cycling was that the only trigger for the cooling fans available on his particular motherboard is CPU temperature. For an air cooled system this might be fine, but a water cooled system with much more thermal mass should be better able to absorb these quick changes in CPU temperature without constantly adjusting fan speed. Using a python script set up to run as a systemd service, the control loop monitors not only the CPU temperature but also the case temperature and the temperature of the coolant, and then preferentially tries to dump heat from the CPU into the thermal mass of the water cooler before much ramping of cooling fans happens.\nAn additional improvement here is that the fans can run at a much lower speed, reducing dust in the computer case and also reducing noise compared to before the optimizations. The computer now reportedly runs almost silently unless it has been under load for several minutes. The script is specific to this setup but easily could be modified for other computers using liquid cooling, and using Grafana to monitor the changes can easily be done as [Cal] also demonstrates when calibrating and testing the system. On the other hand, if you prefer a more flashy cooling system as a living room centerpiece, we have you covered there as well.", "title": "\u30d1\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5236\u5fa1", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u51e6\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3059\u308b\u306b\u3064\u308c\u3001\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb\u3082\u5897\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6db2\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3060\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u3001Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u51b7\u5374\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3001\u51b7\u5374\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u9759\u304b\u306b\u3057\u3001\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d1\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5236\u5fa1", "\u512a\u308c\u305f\u51b7\u5374\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6539\u5584\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u51b7PC\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u6700\u9069\u5316", "\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aPython\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u6d3b\u7528", "\u9759\u7c9b\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u3068\u51b7\u5374\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u6c34\u51b7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

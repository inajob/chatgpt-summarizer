We hope you all have your tickets. If not: Workshop and general admission tickets are on sale now. Were getting down to the last slightly-more-than-two-handfuls, so if youre thinking of coming, the time for procrastination has passed.\nFirst up, we have two late-addition workshops, and tickets were just made available. Maybe you noticed that Arduino was bought by Qualcomm, and they kicked off the union with a brand-new board? You can get yourself one, and learn how to use it. And not to be outdone, the CEO of Framework, makers of modular laptop computers, is coming with a grab-bag of parts for you to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeonardo Cavagnis  Tyler Wojciechowicz\nArduino x DigiKey Presents  From Blink to Think: Discover Arduino Uno Q\n\nExplore the power of Arduino Uno Q, the new board combining a microcontroller and a microprocessor. In this hands-on workshop, you\u2019ll learn how to get started with Uno Q and unlock its dual-core capabilities for intelligent and connected projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNirav Patel\nFramework Mystery Boxes: Swap  Build \nThis workshop is hosted by Framework\u2019s Founder and CEO, Nirav Patel. You\u2019ll receive a box of assorted returned/refurbished Framework Laptop parts at the start of the workshop. You can then trade parts with other attendees and work together to try to build a functioning computer of some kind. You\u2019ll pick up some tips and tricks on debugging and repair along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew-Space Panel\nThere is so much going on in space these days that we thought we\u2019d do a break-out panel just to catch you up. Moderated by [Sirina Nabhan], a systems engineer at NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network, [Joey Jefferson] and [Celeste Smith] will be on hand to get us up to speed on future Moon and Mars missions.\n\n\n\n\nCostume Party and Thursday Night Pre-Event Meetup\nFriday night is Halloween, and we\u2019ve got Supplyframe headquarters to party in. In honor of our fantastic keynote panel this year, chock-full of the people who bring the Star Trek universe to life, we\u2019re thinking Sci-Fi themed. Of course, we won\u2019t turn you away no matter what your costume (or lack thereof) but if you do have a replica phaser kicking around in your closet, you will want to bust it out for the party.\nSo after a mellow day of badge hacking, attending workshops, or just hanging out with 511 of your new Hackaday friends, why not slip into something less comfortable for the evening? It\u2019s catered and open bar, but we\u2019ll also keep a zone open full of hot soldering irons.\nAnd if you\u2019re already in town on Thursday night, the 30th, meet up with us for an off-the-official-schedule pint at Kings Row. We\u2019ll be there from 7 pm until, if history is any guide, they close down and send us home.\nLightning Talks\nFinally, as we have for the last few years, we\u2019re hosting Lightning Talks on Sunday morning. This is your chance to present seven minutes\u2019 worth of hacking to our rapt audience. If you\u2019ve got something to say, register your talk here!\n", "title": "\u300cArduino Uno Q\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u300d", "body": "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u307e\u3067\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u4e2d\uff01Arduino\u3084Framework\u306e\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5f8c\u306e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u3084\u8efd\u3044\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u3082\u958b\u50ac\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cArduino Uno Q\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u300d", "\u300cFramework\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u81ea\u4f5cPC\u306b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u5b87\u5b99\u63a2\u67fb\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u77e5\u308d\u3046\uff1a\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u958b\u50ac\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u8863\u88c5\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3068\u524d\u591c\u30df\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u300d", "\u300c\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3057\u3088\u3046\u300d"]}

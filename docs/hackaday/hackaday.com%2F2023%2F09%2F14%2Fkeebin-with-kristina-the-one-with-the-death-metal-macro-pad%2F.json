Wouldnt you just play with the tentacles (?) all the time like I would? Yeah, thats what I thought. Theyre pretty inviting.\nSo why does this look so fantastic? Its an SLA print, for one thing. For another, [zyumbik] spent over 1,000 hours designing the thing. Unfortunately its not open-source, but you can buy the only other one in existence for a cool $1,000.\nRubiks Cube Keyboard\nAlthough it doesnt rotate (yet), creator [_Rudeism] is calling this the Rubiks Cube Keyboard. Fine with me, though any type of actual rotation would be insanely difficult to pull off. The plan is to do it with RGB LEDs.\nThe layout is QWERTY-adjacent  the white side is the num pad, yellow has the modifiers, and the other four sides house all the letters. As you might imagine, this uses a custom frame and PCBs. The switches are Glorious Gateron Clears, which definitely supports the blinkenlights planned for V2.\nThis thing reminds me a bit of of the SafeType vertical keyboard, or even [Aaron Rasmussen]s spherical keyboard. Be sure to check it out in Monkeytype action, where [_Rudeism] manages to pull off about 20WPM.\nThe Centerfold: All Clear Everything\n By now yall know how much I love clear technology and things. I even built an all-clear ErgoDox, minus the PCBs of course. So its only natural that I would choose [HadouKang]s setup for this issues centerfold.\nThat cute little pill organizer of a keyboard is Vault35 with the ortho PCB option, Designer Studio White Jade switches, and MiTo Keysterine keycaps. The buds are Beats Studio Buds+, and the pen is an Opus88 Demonstrator, an interesting fountain pen that one fills with an eyedropper instead of simply drawing the ink up with suction. Finally, dig that lil crab holding up the pen. Doesnt it just make this whole picture?\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: The Crandall New Model\nImage via Antikey Shop\nOften cited as the most beautiful typewriter ever produced, Id have to agree that the Crandall New Model is a sight to behold. Between the mother-of-pearl inlay, floral arrangements, ornate gold embellishments and pin-striping, youd think it was an expensive sewing machine of the same era (1886-1888).\nMost notable beyond the style are the two-row keyboard and something less obvious  the type-sleeve. Instead of individual type bars, the New Model has a cylinder about the size of a finger with glyphs all the way around\u00a0 it. When a key was struck, the cylinder would rotate to the correct position and move up or down as necessary to strike the paper. I think this has to be the inspiration for the typeball in the IBM Selectric.\nThe awesome thing about the type-sleeve is that you could easily change fonts, which seems kind of mind-blowing for 1886. Speaking of fonts, its really, really weird to me how modern those legends look. Youd halfway expect something more flowery, wouldnt you?\nICYMI: A Raspi Typewriter for the Modern Age\nDistraction-free writing is getting harder and harder to come by. Not only is there the pull of life, the computer itself is full of attention-getting alternatives to what one writer called bleeding from the forehead.\nFor [Brendan], there was just one more obstacle to writing the great American novel: the lack of a dedicated machine that would have all the right features. So naturally, [Brendan] took time to whip one up.\nThe Most Unusual Sentence Extractor, or MUSE for short, is a Raspberry Pi-powered typewriter that saves to the cloud. The design is heavily inspired by the Olympia Traveller de Luxe of the late 1960s and early 70s, and it looks fantastic. I love the logo and the fact that [Brendan] incorporated the LCD touch screen into what would be the platen on an actual typewriter.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

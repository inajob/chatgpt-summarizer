She goes through how many images youll need and what types to get the shape-and-color recognition needed for this project, as well as how to annotate them and train the model, either locally or in the cloud.\nThe project itself is an adorable paper-mache dinosaur with a servo-actuated mouth hiding some LEDs and a Raspberry Pi camera module to provide images. In operation, the dinosaur talks to children using pre-recorded voice lines, inviting them to play a game and put a specific shape, or shape of a specific color (or both) in its mouth. Then the aforementioned object detection (running on a laptop) goes YOLO and identifies the shape so the toy can provide feedback on the childs choice via a speaker in the belly of the beast.\nThe link to the game code is currently not valid, but it looks like they used PyGame for the audio output code. A servo motor controls the mouth, but without that code its not entirely clear to us what its doing. We expect by the time you read this theres good odds [be_riddickulous] will have fixed that link and you can see for yourself.\nThe only thing that holds this back from being a great toy to put in every Kindergarten class is the need to have a laptop close by to plug the webcam into. A Raspberry Pi 5 ought to have the horsepower to run YOLOv11, so with a little extra effort the whole thing could be standalone  there might even be room in there for batteries.Weve had other hacks aimed at little ones, like a kid-friendly computer to relive the glory days of the school computer lab or one of the many iterations of the RFID jukebox idea. If you want to wow the kiddos with AI, perhaps take a look at this talking Santa plush.\nGot a cool project, AI, kid-related, or otherwise? Dont forget to toss us a tip!"}

These days, though, its a trial and a bore to go outside and stare upwards to check on the natural satellite. Instead, why not bring the Moon to your bedside with this rotating phase lamp?\nThe build comes to us from [payasa_manandhar], who did a good job of replicating the Moon in both form and function. Its based around a lithophane of the lunar surface, which adequately duplicates the Moons grey pockmarked visage thanks to topographical data sourced from NASA. It looks a treat when backlit from the inside. However, this is no mere ornamental lamp. With the aid of a stepper motor controlled by an Arduino, a shade inside the lamp actually rotates to shadow the Moon as per the appropriate phase.\nIts a build that is both fun and educational, in both the electronic and astronomical disciplines. Weve seen some other great Moon lamps before, too.\n\n"}

The documents involved include service manuals, circuit diagrams, and technical details, and Elon Musk himself Tweeted posted on X that All design  engineering of the original @Tesla Roadster is now fully open source.\nWe like the idea and theres plenty of interesting stuff there, but we cant find an open-source licence anywhere and we have to take issue with his Whatever we have, you now have comment. What we have is useful maintenance information and presents a valuable window into 2010s cutting edge of electric vehicles, but if its everything they have then something must have gone very wrong in the Tesla archives. Its possible someone might take a Lotus Elise and produce something close to a Roadster replica with this info, but its by no means enough to make a car from. Instead were guessing it may be a prelude to reducing support for what is a low-production car from over a decade ago.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicle manufacturers open-sourcing their older models we already have a model in the form of Renaults open-source version of their Twizy runabout. This is a far more credible set of information that can be used to make a fully open-source version of the car, rather than a set of workshop manuals.\nTesla Roadster, cytech, CC BY 2.0.", "title": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u516c\u958b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u304c\u521d\u4ee3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30022010\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6700\u5148\u7aef\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u60c5\u5831\u3060\u304c\u3001\u8eca\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306b\u306f\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3002\u3088\u308a\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u60c5\u5831\u306f\u30eb\u30ce\u30fc\u306eTwizy\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u7248\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u516c\u958b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u516c\u5f0f\u60c5\u5831\u516c\u958b\uff1a\u521d\u4ee3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u56de\u8def\u56f3\u3084\u6280\u8853\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u60c5\u5831\u516c\u958b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ea\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u4f5c\u6210\u3078\u306e\u9053", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u521d\u4ee3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3068\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u60c5\u5831\u516c\u958b\uff1a\u30cf\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3078\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9"]}

Only, this one is built using somewhat modern hardware\u2014relying on the grunt of the PIC32MZ2048EFH144 to get the job done. Meet the Acolyte Hand PICd 32.\nIts name might be a mouthful, but that chip can pull off some great feats! With a clock speed of 200 MHz, its not\u00a0 short on processing power, though RAM and flash storage are somewhat limited at just 512 KB and 2MB respectively. [Chad] was able to leverage those constraints to get a VGA output working at a resolutions up to 800 x 600, with up to 65,000 colors\u2014though 256 colors is more practical due to memory concerns. The Acolyte Hand also rocks two 8-bit audio channels. It has a pair of Genesis-compatible controller ports as well as PS/2 and USB for keyboards and mice, along with more modern Xbox 360 controllers.\n[Chad] cooked up some software to put it through its paces, too. Its got a Tetris clone on board, and can also run Game Boy games at full speed via the Peanut-GB emulator. That provides for a pretty rich game library, though [Chad] notes he plans to develop more native video games for his system to demo at his local college. Design files are on Github for the curious.\nThis project is a great example of just how powerful modern microcontrollers have become. Once upon a time, just driving a simple black-and-white graphical LCD might have taken some real effort, but today, there are pixels and clock cycles to spare in projects like these. Truly a wonderous world we live in!", "title": "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cAcolyte Hand PICd 32\u300d", "body": "\u30c1ad Burrow\u306fPIC32MZ\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002VGA\u51fa\u529b\u3084\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u73fe\u4ee3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cAcolyte Hand PICd 32\u300d", "- \u9ad8\u901fPIC32MZ2048\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b800x600\u306eVGA\u51fa\u529b", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3084\u30c6\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u5e38\u8b58", "- Github\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\uff01\u300cAcolyte Hand\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u60c5\u5831"]}

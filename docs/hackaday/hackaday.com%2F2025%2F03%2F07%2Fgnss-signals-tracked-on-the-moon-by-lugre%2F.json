LuGRE consists of a weak-signal GNSS receiver, a high-gain L-band patch antenna the requisite amplification and filter circuits, designed to track a number of GPS and Galileo signals.\nDesigned by NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ISA), the LuGRE payloads goal was to demonstrate GNSS-based positioning, navigation and timing at the Moon. This successful demonstration makes it plausible that future lunar missions, whether in orbit or on the surface, could use Earths GNSS satellites to navigate and position themselves with. On the way to the lunar surface, LuGRE confirmed being able track GNSS at various distances from the Earth.\nBoth LuGRE and BGM1 are part of NASAs Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, with BGM1 delivering a total of ten payloads to the Moon, each designed to study a different aspect of the lunar environment, as well as hardware and technologies relevant to future missions."}

But, sometimes, it isnt practical. [Ham Radio Rookie] knew about random wire antennas but didnt want a wire antenna. So, he took carbon fiber extension poles and Faraday tape and made a random stick antenna. You can check it out in the video below.\nWe arent sure what normal people are doing with 7-meter-long telescoping poles, but  as you might expect  the carbon fiber is not particularly conductive. Thats where the tape comes in. Each section gets some tape, and when you stretch it out, the tape lines up.\n\nWe arent sure how these poles are constructed, but the video claims that the adjacent sections couple capacitively. We arent sure about that as the carbon fiber wont be very conductive, but it probably isnt a very good insulator, either. Then again, the poles may have a paint or other coating along the surface. So without seeing it, it is hard to say whats coupling the elements.\nHe admits this is experimental and there is more work to do. However, it seems cheap and easy to setup. The hardest part is tapping an M10 hole in the end cap to allow things to mount.\nWe suppose you could make your own tubes, but it hardly seems worth the trouble. If you cut or drill this stuff, you might want to take precautions.\n", "title": "- \u70ad\u7d20\u7e4a\u7dad\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u70ad\u7d20\u7e4a\u7dad\u88fd\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30ad\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002\u624b\u8efd\u3067\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u3060\u304c\u3001\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u69cb\u9020\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["- \u70ad\u7d20\u7e4a\u7dad\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30e9\u30c7\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u3055\u3068\u52b9\u679c", "- 7\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u4f38\u7e2e\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306eDIY", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

After reminding listeners of the upcoming Hackaday Supercon and Jawncon events, we take a moment to mark the sad passing of the prolific YouTuber, Robert Murray-Smith.\nBefore diving into the real hacks, there are a couple of more general news stories with an effect on our community. First, the takeover of Arduino by Qualcomm, and what its effect is likely to be. We try to speculate as to where the Arduino platform might go from here, and even whether it remains the player it once was, in 2025. Then theres the decision by Google to restrict Android sideloading to only approved-developer APKs unless over ADB. Its an assault on a users rights over their own hardware, as well as something of a blow to the open-source Android ecosystem. What will be our communitys response?\nOn more familiar territory we have custom LCDs, algorithmic art, and a discussion of non-stepper motors in 3D printing. Even the MakerBot Cupcake makes an appearance. Then theres a tiny RV, new creative use of an ESP32 peripheral, and the DVD logo screensaver, in hardware. We end the show with a look at why logic circuits use the voltages they do. Its a smorgasbord of hacks for your listening enjoyment.\n\nDownload yourself an MP3 even without a Hackaday Listeners License.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 341 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2025 Hackaday Supercon: More Wonderful Speakers\nJawnCon Returns This Weekend\nHonoring The Legacy Of Robert Murray-Smith\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill in the form with your best guess to be entered to win next week.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nQualcomm Introduces The Arduino Uno Q Linux-Capable SBC\nGoogle Confirms Non-ADB APK Installs Will Require Developer Registration\nMesmerizing Patterns From Simple Rules\nHow To Design Custom LCDs For Your Own Projects\n\n[Joey Castillo] on everything about LCDs\n\n\nWhy Stepper Motors Still Dominate 3D Printing\nHow Your SID May Not Be As Tuneful As You\u2019d Like\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nA Childhood Dream, Created And Open Sourced\nTips For C Programming From Nic Barker\nFinding Simpler Schlieren Imaging Systems\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\nBuilding The DVD Logo Screensaver With LEGO\nESP32 Decodes S/PDIF Like A Boss (Or Any Regular Piece Of Hi-Fi Equipment)\nKei Truck Becomes Tiny RV\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nAsk Hackaday: Why Is TTL 5 Volts?\n\nThe 7400 Quad 2-Input NAND Gate, A Neglected Survivor From A Pre-Microprocessor World\n\n\n\n\nKnow Audio: Distortion Part Two\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b: Arduino\u306e\u8cb7\u53ce\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "body": "Hackaday\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3001Arduino\u306e\u8cb7\u53ce\u3084Google\u306eAPK\u5236\u9650\u3092\u8b70\u8ad6\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u6e80\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b: Arduino\u306e\u8cb7\u53ce\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30ec\u30fc=\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u3092\u5072\u3093\u3067: YouTube\u754c\u306e\u5de8\u661f\u306e\u8ffd\u60bc", "\u72ec\u81eaLCD\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

Actually, we have two floating around one of the Hackaday bunkers, and they are quite the conversation piece. You can watch the video below.\nThe device is often mistaken for a spyglass, but it is really a huge slide rule with the scale wrapped around in a rod-shaped form factor. The video says the scale is the same as a 30-inch scale, but we think it is closer to 66 inches.\n\nSlide rules work using the idea that adding up logarithms is the same as multiplying. For example, for a base 10 logarithm, log(10)=1, log(100)=2, and log(1000)=3. So you can see that 1+2=3. If the scales are printed so that you can easily add and then look up the antilog, you can easily figure out that 10100=1000.\nThe black center part acts like a cursor on a conventional slide rule. How does it work? Watch [Chris] video and youll see. We know from experience that one of these in good shape isnt cheap. Lucky that [Chris] gives us a 3D printed version so you can make your own.\nAnother way to reduce the scale is to go circular, and you can make one of those, too.\n"}

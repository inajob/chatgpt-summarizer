Actually, we have two floating around one of the Hackaday bunkers, and they are quite the conversation piece. You can watch the video below.\nThe device is often mistaken for a spyglass, but it is really a huge slide rule with the scale wrapped around in a rod-shaped form factor. The video says the scale is the same as a 30-inch scale, but we think it is closer to 66 inches.\n\nSlide rules work using the idea that adding up logarithms is the same as multiplying. For example, for a base 10 logarithm, log(10)=1, log(100)=2, and log(1000)=3. So you can see that 1+2=3. If the scales are printed so that you can easily add and then look up the antilog, you can easily figure out that 10100=1000.\nThe black center part acts like a cursor on a conventional slide rule. How does it work? Watch [Chris] video and youll see. We know from experience that one of these in good shape isnt cheap. Lucky that [Chris] gives us a 3D printed version so you can make your own.\nAnother way to reduce the scale is to go circular, and you can make one of those, too.\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b", "body": "Otis King\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u5186\u5f62\u3067\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3053\u306a\u3059\u9053\u5177\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b", "- \u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u89e3\u91c8\uff1a\u30ed\u30c3\u30c9\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ed\u30b0\u3092\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u639b\u3051\u7b97\u3092\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30af\u30eb\u578b\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

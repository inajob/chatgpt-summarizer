A few folks asked us for a little more time to get their proposals together for our upcoming 2024 Hackaday Europe event in Berlin, and we\u2019re listening. So now you\u2019ve got an extra week \u2013 get your proposals for talks or workshops in before February 29th.\n[Joey Castillo]s awesome custom touchpadHackaday Europe is a two-day event taking place April 13th and 14th in Berlin, Germany. Saturday the 13th is the big day, with a full day of badge hacking, talks, music, and everything else. We\u2019ve got the place booked until 2 AM, so get your sleep the night before. Sunday is a half-day of brunch, lightning talks, and showing off the badge hacks from the day before. And if you\u2019re in town on Friday the 12th, we\u2019ll be going out in the evening for drinks and dinner, location TBA but hopefully closer than where we ended up last year!\nThe badge is going to be a re-spin of the Supercon badge for all of you who couldn\u2019t fly out to the US last November. There are no secrets anymore, so get your pre-hacks started now. We\u2019ve seen some sweet all-analog hacks, some complete revisions of the entire firmware loadout, and, of course, all sorts of awesome hardware bodged onto it. Heck, we even saw Asteroids and DOOM. But we haven\u2019t seen any native Jerobeam Fenderson-style oscilloscope music. You\u2019ve got your homework.\nWhat to Bring?\nA few other people have asked if they could bring in (art) projects to show and share. Of course! Depending on the scale, though, you may need to contact us beforehand. If it\u2019s larger than a tower PC, get in touch with us, and we\u2019ll work it out. Smaller hacks, projects in progress, and anything you want to bring along to show and inspire others with, are, of course, welcome without any strings attached.\nWhat else might you need? A computer of your choice and a micro USB cable for programming the badge. There will be soldering stations, random parts, and someone will probably be able to lend you nearly any other piece of gear, so you can pack light if you want to. But you dont have to.\nIf you\u2019d like to attend but you don\u2019t have tickets yet \u2013 get them soon! Space is limited, and we tend to sell out. Or better yet, submit a talk and sneak in the side door. We\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019ve got going on, and we can\u2019t wait to see you all.", "title": "2024 Hackaday Europe \u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30eb\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c\u5ef6\u9577", "body": "2024\u5e74\u306eHackaday Europe\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30eb\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c2\u670829\u65e5\u304b\u30891\u9031\u9593\u5ef6\u9577\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30024\u670813\u65e5\u306814\u65e5\u306b\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30ea\u30f3\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3001\u571f\u66dc\u65e5\u306b\u306f\u30d5\u30eb\u30c7\u30a4\u306e\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u65e5\u66dc\u65e5\u306b\u306f\u671d\u98df\u3084badge hacks\u306e\u767a\u8868\u306a\u3069\u304c\u4e88\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u53c2\u52a0\u5e0c\u671b\u8005\u306f\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u65e9\u3081\u306b\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u63d0\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["2024 Hackaday Europe \u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30eb\u7de0\u3081\u5207\u308a\u304c\u5ef6\u9577", "\u30d9\u30eb\u30ea\u30f3\u3067\u306e2\u65e5\u9593\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8", "Supercon \u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u304c\u518d\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u53c2\u52a0OK", "\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8cfc\u5165\u304b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u63d0\u51fa\u3067 Hackaday Europe \u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u53c2\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd"]}

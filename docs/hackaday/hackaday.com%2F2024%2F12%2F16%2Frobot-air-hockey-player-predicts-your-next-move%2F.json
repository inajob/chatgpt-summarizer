That is, unless you have a smart robot hockey player to act as your rival. [Zeroshot] built exactly that.\nThe build is based around a small 27-inch air hockey table\u2014not exactly arcade-spec, but big enough to demonstrate the concepts at play. The robot player moves its mallet in the X and Y axes using a pair of NEMA17 stepper motors and an H-belt configuration. To analyze the game state, theres a Raspberry Pi 3B fitted with a camera, and it has a top-down view of the board. The Pi gives the stepper motors commands on how to move the mallet via an Arduino that communicates with the stepper drivers.\u00a0 The Pi doesnt just aim for the puck itself, either. With Python and OpenCV, it tries to predict your own moves by tracking your mallet, and the puck, too. It predicts the very-predictable path of the puck, and moves itself to the right position for effective defence.\nBelieve it or not, weve featured quite a few projects in this vein before. Theyve all got their similarities, and their own unique quirks. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to hari wiguna for the tip!]"}

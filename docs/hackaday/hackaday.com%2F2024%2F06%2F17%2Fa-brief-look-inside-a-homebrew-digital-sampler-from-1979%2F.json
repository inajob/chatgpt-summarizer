That generally happens with new projects and work in progress, but it can also happen with old projects. Sometimes very old indeed, as is the case with this digital sampling unit for analog oscilloscopes, circa 1979.\nWeve got precious little to go on with this one other than the bit of eye candy in the video tour below and its description. Luckily, weve had a few private conversations with its maker, [Mitsuru Yamada], over the years, enough to piece together a little of the back story here  with apologies for any wrong assumptions, of course.\nBuilt when he was only 19, this sampler was an attempt to build something that couldnt be bought, at least not for a reasonable price. With no inexpensive monolithic analog-to-digital converters on the market, he decided to roll his own. A few years back he recreated the core of that with his all-discrete successive approximation ADC.\nThe sampler shown below has an 8-bit SAR ADC using discrete CMOS logic and enough NMOS memory to store 256 samples. You can see the ADC and memory cards in the homebrew card cage made from aluminum angle stock. The front panel has a ton of controls and sports a wide-range attenuator, DC offset, and trigger circuit with both manual and automatic settings.\nIts an impressive build, especially for a 19-year-old with presumably limited resources. Weve reached out to [Yamada-san] in the hope that hell be able to provide more details on whats under the hood and if this still works after all these years. Well pass along whatever we get, but in the meantime, enjoy.\n\n"}

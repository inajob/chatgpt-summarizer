For those not playing along at home, auto manufacturers have been making moves toward deleting AM radios from cars because theyre too sensitive to all the RF interference generated by modern vehicles. The trouble with that is that the government has spent a lot of effort on making AM broadcasters the centerpiece of a robust and survivable emergency communications system that reaches 90% of the US population.\nThe bill would require cars and trucks manufactured or sold in the US to be equipped to receive AM broadcasts without further fees or subscriptions, and seems to enjoy bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. Critics of the bill will likely point out that while the AM broadcast system is a fantastic resource for emergency communications, if nobody is listening to it when an event happens, whats the point? Thats fair, but short-sighted; emergency communications isnt just about warning people that something is going to happen, but coordinating the response after the fact. We imagine Hurricane Helenes path of devastation from Florida to Pennsylvania this week and the subsequent emergency response might bring that fact into focus a bit.\n\nThe US Geological Survey and NASA bid goodbye to Landsat 7 this week, 25 years into its five-year mission to watch the planet. Launched in 1999, the satellites imaging instruments were witness to many Earth changes, both natural and man-made. Its before-and-after images, like this look at New Orleans around the time of Hurricane Katrina, are especially striking. Despite suffering instrumentation problems within a few years of launch that degraded image quality on some of its sensors, Landsat 7 sent a wealth of geophysical data down to Earth, enough that it has over 210,000 citations in the scientific literature. The aging satellite was moved to a lower orbit in 2021 to make way for its newer cousins, Landsat 8 and 9, which put its polar sun-synchronous orbit out of sync with mission requirements. Despite this, it kept on grabbing images right up until May 28, 2024, when it grabbed a picture of Las Vegas that shows the dramatic increase in the size of the metro area over the last 25 years, along with the stunning decrease of Lake Mead.\nHow much do you enjoy captchas? If youre anything like us, youve learned to loathe their intentionally fuzzy photos where you have to find traffic lights, stairs, motorcycles, or cars to prove youre human. Well, surprise  just because you can (eventually) solve a captcha doesnt make you a human. It turns out that AI can do it too. A security research group at ETH Zurich managed to modify YOLO to solve Googles reCAPTCHAv2, saying it wasnt even particularly hard to get it to pass the test 100% of the time within two tries. Think about that the next time youre wondering if that tiny sliver of the riders helmet that intrudes just a tiny bit into one frame counts as a square containing a motorcycle.\nWere not much into cryptocurrency around here, but we do love vaults and over-the-top physical security, and that makes this article on a Swiss Bitcoin vault worth looking at. If youre perplexed with the need for a physical vault to keep your virtual currency safe, we get it. But with people investing huge amounts of effort in excavating landfills for accidentally disposed hard drives containing Bitcoin wallets worth millions, it starts to make sense. The vault in this story is impressively well-protected, living deep within the granite of a Swiss mountain and protected from every conceivable threat. Ah, but its the inconceivable threats that get you, isnt it? And when you put a lot of valuable things together in one place, well  lets just say were eagerly awaiting the based on a true story heist film.\nAnd finally, YouTube seems to be the go-to resource for how-to videos, and weve all likely gotten quick tutorials on everything from fixing a toilet to writing a will. So why not a tutorial on changing a fuel filter on an Airbus A320? Sure, you might not need to do one, and were pretty sure youll be arrested for even trying without the proper certifications, but its cool to see it down. All things considered, it doesnt look all that hard, what with all the ease-of-maintenance features built into the Pratt and Whitney PW1100G engine. As weve spent many hours on a creeper in the driveway doing repairs that would better be done on the lift we cant afford, we found the fact that the mechanic has to lie on his back on the tarmac to service a multimillion-dollar aircraft pleasingly ironic.\n", "title": "\u7c73\u56fd\u3067AM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u7fa9\u52d9\u5316\u6cd5\u6848\u304c\u524d\u9032", "body": "\u7c73\u56fd\u4e0b\u9662\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u5546\u696d\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a\u306b\u9032\u51fa\u3057\u305fAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u88fd\u4f5c\u6cd5\u6848\u3002\u7dca\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u3001USGS\u3068NASA\u306eLandsat7\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a00\u53ca\u3002AI\u304c\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u3092\u89e3\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u4fdd\u7ba1\u5eab\u3068YouTube\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c73\u56fd\u3067AM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u7fa9\u52d9\u5316\u6cd5\u6848\u304c\u524d\u9032", "\u7c73\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u7dca\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068AM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "Landsat 7\u300125\u5e74\u306e\u4efb\u52d9\u7d42\u4e86", "AI\u304cCAPTCHA\u3092\u89e3\u8aad", "\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u4fdd\u7ba1\u5eab\u306e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3"]}

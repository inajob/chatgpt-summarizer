[Toby Chui] plans to be one of those hackers and wants something to give to fellow attendees. Thus, the $3 Macro Pad was born.\nWeve seen our fair share of macro pads, so a simple four-key pad isnt exactly novel. However, the focus on size and cost makes it stand out. The pad is the size of a business card, making it easy to give away. For a microcontroller, [Toby] used a CH552G, which is cheap and compatible with the Arduino IDE. Although, with 10 GPIO, a matrix layout could have supported a full-sized number pad, the diodes required would have added to the cost significantly. A cheap PCB and 3d-printed base make up the devices bulk.\n[Toby] provides a handy tool for assigning keys from your browser without coding. However, the source code is on GitHub if you want to develop a more complicated scheme. This isnt the first time weve featured the CH552 chip, and it likely wont be the last.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c$3 Macro Pad\u300d\uff1a\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "body": "Supercon 2022\u3067\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u304cMaker Faire\u3001\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u3067\u518d\u3073\u96c6\u307e\u308a\u59cb\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5206\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002Toby Chui\u306f\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u306b\u4f55\u304b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001$3\u306eMacro Pad\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3067\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u305f\u3081\u3001\u914d\u5e03\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002CH552G\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8 \u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u304b\u3089\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u5272\u308a\u5f53\u3066\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002GitHub\u306b\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c$3 Macro Pad\u300d\uff1a\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9", "\u300cSupercon 2022\u300d\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3084\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u306e\u4ea4\u6d41\u304c\u518d\u3073\u59cb\u307e\u308b", "\u300cCH552G\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u300d\uff1a Arduino IDE \u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u30c1\u30fc\u30d7\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u300c\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u4e0a\u3067\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u300d\uff1a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u300c\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u300d\uff1a\u5b89\u3044\u57fa\u677f\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b"]}

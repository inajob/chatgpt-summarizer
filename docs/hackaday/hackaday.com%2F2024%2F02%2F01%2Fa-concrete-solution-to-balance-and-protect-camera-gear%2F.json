[Dane Kouttron] wanted to stop sacrificing lights to the cause, so he came up with a practical use for a weeble: A self-stabilizing monopod.\nInspired by a giant scale weeble built by [Colin Furze], [Dane] first did the math to determine the parameters for the build. It\u2019s all about achieving torque equilibrium with a hemisphere of concrete, and [Dane] walks us through the equations, arriving at the conclusion that a 2 lb. camera on 4 foot pole, one needs a hemisphere with a mass of 28 lbs. and a radius of just under 4 inches. To achieve this weight in the given volume would require extra dense concrete with steel shot added.\nAfter some CAD work and 3D printing the 4-part mold was assembled, with RTV silicone sealant acting as both adhesive between the parts and mold release agent. [Dane] first did a test mold with concrete he had laying around. With success achieved, he pursued the real mix but had issues with an error in the concrete-water ratio and the difficulty of mixing in the steel shot. On the second attempt he managed to extract a functional hemisphere from the mold, with the pole held in position during curing by a 3D printed bracket.\nThe hemisphere bottom of the hemisphere has a flat spot to keep it stable when bumped lightly. [Dane] added a Manfroto quick-release mount to the end of the pole to allow easy attachment of lights and cameras. It might be a bit hefty to carry around, but its takes up less floor space than a tripod and is sure to save [Dane] from expensive bumps-turned-crashes.\nCamera cranes, small and large, are another great tool for workshop cinematography. For sheer overkill it would be hard to beat an 8-axis workshop-sized motion control robot.", "title": "\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5 ", "body": "\u4f5c\u696d\u5834\u3067\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u4e2d\u306b\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u6a5f\u6750\u3092\u5012\u3059\u3053\u3068\u306f\u907f\u3051\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3060\u3002\u305d\u3053\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\u3068\u3001[Dane Kouttron]\u304c\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u8003\u6848\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u534a\u7403\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u6750\u6599\u306e\u8a08\u7b97\u3082\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5 ", "\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u306a\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30dd\u30c9\u3088\u308a\u3082\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9 ", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9 ", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u30e2\u30ce\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08 ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u81ea\u5df1\u5b89\u5b9a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

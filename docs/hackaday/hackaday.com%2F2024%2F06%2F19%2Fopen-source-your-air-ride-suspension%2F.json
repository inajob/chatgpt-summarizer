The Open Source Air Suspension Management Controller aims to give people a fully customizable system without the expense or limitations of commercial units.\nThe project started as an upgrade to a basic commercial system, so it assumes that youre bringing your own bags, tank, compressor, tubing and fittings, gauges and manual paddle switches. The current board uses an Arduino Nano, but the next revision based on the ESP32 will allow for a wider feature set.\nWith a Bluetooth connection and Android app, you can control your ride height from a phone or integrated Android head unit. Currently, the app shows the pressure readings from all four corners and has controls for increasing or decreasing the pressure or airing all the way up or down to a given set point.\nWant to know how air suspensions work?

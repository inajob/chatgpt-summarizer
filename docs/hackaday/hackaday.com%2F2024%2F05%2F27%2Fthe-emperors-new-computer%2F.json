Wheres the computer? Well, if it is [DIY Perk]s office, the desk is the computer. Like a transformer robot, the desk transforms into a good-looking PC.\nHe starts with a commercial desk and creates a replacement desktop out of some aluminum sheets and extrusions. The motion uses some V-slot profiles and linear rails. The monitor and keyboard shelf pop up on invisible hinges. When closed, theres no trace of a computer.\n\nThe mechanics of the pop-out hatch are complex, but they worked the first time. At least, we think it was the first time. Video editing is a possibility! He did have to add some springs and pneumatics to keep it from slamming down. A magnet gives a positive lock feeling when you open the hatch.\nThe monitor is an ultra-wide OLED that can be curved or flat. He removed the electronics from the panel and mounted the screen on the inner part of the hatch. Half of the electronics went back into the desk. A small but powerful PC with an Intel I9 and a graphics card fit in the desk. A conventional power supply would be too large, but a pair of very thin GaN power supplies come to the rescue.\nSurplus server heatsinks keep the system cool without breaking the bank.\nThermal management is also something that could easily be too thick. The solution was a custom brass heat spreader that runs the length of the desk, onto which he mounted 40 surplus server heatsinks paired with laptop fans. But when they failed to get the job done, larger heatsinks and fans were brought in. These stick out below the bottom of the desk, but you wouldnt notice unless you were laying on the floor.\nHonestly, the build is amazing. If you are on the fence, watch the first few seconds of the video where the desk transforms, and youll be hooked. The final step was to make the aluminum desktop look like wood with oak planks and some optical illusions.\nWe doubt our woodworking and machining skills are up to duplicating this, but we wish hed take our money. Desk computers arent really a new idea, of course. Be glad you dont have to build a 1965 desktop computer into a desk.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u304b\u3089\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3078\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308bDIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u304cPC\u306b\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3084\u71b1\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5916\u89b3\u306f\u6728\u76ee\u8abf\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u304b\u3089\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3078\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC", "\u5909\u5f62\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u5185\u8535\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u4ed5\u69d8\u306e\u8d85\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9OLED\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af", "\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5091\u4f5c\uff1a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fcPC", "\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u51b7\u5374"]}

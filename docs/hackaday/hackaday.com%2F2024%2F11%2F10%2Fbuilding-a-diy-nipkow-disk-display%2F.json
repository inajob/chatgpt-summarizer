But there were other display technologies that worked, they just werent as practical. One scheme was the Nipkow disk, and [Bitluni] decided to build a working demonstration of how such a system works.\nEssentially, theres a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it. As the disk spins, a light behind it turns on or off. If you time everything right, you get an image that can move. This particular model uses stepper motors, which is a bit of a modern concession.\nThe result was actually much better than you might guess, but a far cry from a modern display device, of course. The screen material needed a little tweaking, but even the initial results were very impressive. If this were trying to be practical, it would probably require a bit more work on the light source and screen.\nInterestingly, the Nipkow disk arrangement was just as suitable for scanning as displaying. Instead of a light behind the wheel, you simply used a light sensor. Of course, in practice, getting everything synchronized and mass-producing high-resolution sets would have been a tremendous challenge a century ago.\nNot that people didnt try. There were even color systems using mechanical wheels. In the 1930s, people were sure your TV would contain spinning disks.\n\n"}

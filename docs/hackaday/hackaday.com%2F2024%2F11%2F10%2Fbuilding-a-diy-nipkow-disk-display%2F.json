But there were other display technologies that worked, they just werent as practical. One scheme was the Nipkow disk, and [Bitluni] decided to build a working demonstration of how such a system works.\nEssentially, theres a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it. As the disk spins, a light behind it turns on or off. If you time everything right, you get an image that can move. This particular model uses stepper motors, which is a bit of a modern concession.\nThe result was actually much better than you might guess, but a far cry from a modern display device, of course. The screen material needed a little tweaking, but even the initial results were very impressive. If this were trying to be practical, it would probably require a bit more work on the light source and screen.\nInterestingly, the Nipkow disk arrangement was just as suitable for scanning as displaying. Instead of a light behind the wheel, you simply used a light sensor. Of course, in practice, getting everything synchronized and mass-producing high-resolution sets would have been a tremendous challenge a century ago.\nNot that people didnt try. There were even color systems using mechanical wheels. In the 1930s, people were sure your TV would contain spinning disks.\n\n", "title": "\u30cb\u30d7\u30b3\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6620\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u30cb\u30d7\u30b3\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u52d5\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cb\u30d7\u30b3\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6620\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u56de\u8ee2\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30cb\u30d7\u30b3\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u6280\u8853\u3068\u305d\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u6539\u826f\u70b9", "\u30cb\u30d7\u30b3\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af: \u6614\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066"]}

For others, its the ultimate circuit bending victim. For [Jeremy Geppert], theyre all-around good fun and he wanted to immortalize the device in a Simple Add-On (SAO).\nThis is [Jeremy]s first board and SAO rolled into one, motivated by both Supercon and the SAO Contest. To start things off, [Jeremy] scaled down the design we all know and love to fit a 12832 OLED display, and it looks great. The plan is to have the display, an amplified speaker, and a single button for input.\nBefore committing the board order, [Jeremy] had a brief freak-out about the pin distance as it relates to the window for the OLED display. Luckily, his brother suggested checking things first by printing a 1:1 scale image of the board outline, and laying that over the display.\nThis is the week it all comes together, as the tiny switches and (regular-size) connectors have arrived, and the boards are due quite soon. Go, [Jeremy], go!\n \n\n", "title": "\u300cSpeak n Spell\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b: \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u300d", "body": "\u5b50\u4f9b\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3068\u3057\u3066Speak n Spell\u306f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Jeremy Geppert\u6c0f\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u611b\u3059\u3079\u304d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3002\u5f7c\u306f12832 OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306a\u3069\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fSAO\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cSpeak n Spell\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b: \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30a2\u30c9\u30aa\u30f3\u300d", "\u300cChildhood\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3092\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 - 12832 OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u8ffd\u52a0\u300d", "\u300c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b!

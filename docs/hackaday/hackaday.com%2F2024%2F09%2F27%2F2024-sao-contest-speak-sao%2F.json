For others, its the ultimate circuit bending victim. For [Jeremy Geppert], theyre all-around good fun and he wanted to immortalize the device in a Simple Add-On (SAO).\nThis is [Jeremy]s first board and SAO rolled into one, motivated by both Supercon and the SAO Contest. To start things off, [Jeremy] scaled down the design we all know and love to fit a 12832 OLED display, and it looks great. The plan is to have the display, an amplified speaker, and a single button for input.\nBefore committing the board order, [Jeremy] had a brief freak-out about the pin distance as it relates to the window for the OLED display. Luckily, his brother suggested checking things first by printing a 1:1 scale image of the board outline, and laying that over the display.\nThis is the week it all comes together, as the tiny switches and (regular-size) connectors have arrived, and the boards are due quite soon. Go, [Jeremy], go!\n \n\n"}

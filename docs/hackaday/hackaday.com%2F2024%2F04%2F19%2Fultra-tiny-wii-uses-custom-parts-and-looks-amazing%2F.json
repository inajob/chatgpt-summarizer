Indeed, it was smaller than both the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and most consoles of previous generations, too. Thats not to say it couldnt be smaller, though. [loopj] has built what is perhaps the smallest Wii yet, which measures roughly the same size as a deck of cards. The best bit? The housing is even to scale!\nTheres no emulation jiggery-pokery here. This build uses an original Wii motherboard thats been cut down to the bare basics. Measuring just 62 mm by 62 mm, it features the CPU, GPU, RAM, and flash memory, while most of the extraneous hardware has been eliminated. Power and data is provided to the board from a special Wii Power Strip PCB, while the Periphlex flex PCB handles breaking out controller interfaces. Indeed, the build is nicknamed Short Stack as its built from a number of specialist PCBs for builds like this one. It also uses two boards designed by [YveltalGriffin]  the fujiflex\u00a0for HDMI video output and the nandFlex\u00a0to handle the Wiis NAND memory chip.\n[loopj] also had to design two further PCBs specifically for this build. One handles power, the micro SD card, HDMI connector, and controller ports. Meanwhile, the second handles the power, reset, and sync buttons along with status LEDs. Another neat hack of [loopj]s own devising is using TRRS connectors in place of the original bulky GameCube controller ports.\nUltimately, its volume is just 7.4% that of an original Nintendo Wii. Its probably possible to go smaller, too, says [loopj], so dont expect things to end here. Weve seen some other great Wii mods before, too, like this excellent handheld design.", "title": "\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6700\u5c0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eWii\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u300cNintendo Wii\u300d\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u65b9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3057\u305f\u88fd\u4f5c\u4f8b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5143\u306eWii\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u300162mm x 62mm\u306e\u57fa\u76e4\u306bCPU\u3084GPU\u306a\u3069\u3092\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002\u5bb9\u7a4d\u306f\u5143\u306eWii\u306e7.4%\u3067\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6700\u5c0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eWii\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306eWii\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578bWii", "\u62e1\u5f35\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7701\u7565\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306aWii\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "HDMI\u6620\u50cf\u51fa\u529b\u3068Wiis NAND\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6271\u3046\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fWii\u306e\u6539\u9020", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092TRRS\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u305f\u5c0f\u578bWii\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3"]}

Whether your screen is a domestic TV or a dedicated monitor, the heat and voltage stress of driving a CRT made these devices significantly less reliable than many of their modern-day counterparts. [Adrians Digital Basement] has a worn-out and broken Commodore 1701 monitor, which hes brought back to life with a modern circuit board and a CRT transplant.\nFollowing on from a previous project, hes using a replacement board sold as a repair option for CRT TVs on AliExpress. The Commodore monitor has its board on a metal chassis which takes the replacement with a bit of modification. He doesnt say where the new CRT came from, but were guessing it was a late model TV as CRTs made over the last few decades are more interchangeable than might be expected. Theres a moment of mild dodginess as he makes a voltage doubler to run the 220 V board from 120 V with a pair of large electrolytic capacitors hot glued in place, but otherwise its a success.\nAt the end of it all after some testing and set-up he has a Commodore monitor with a new heart and multi-standard support. Is it really a Commodore monitor though, or should it have been repaired? Its a difficult one to answer, but wed suggest that CRT monitor repair is less easy today than it used to be because many of the parts are now difficult to find. If it saves at least some of the original from the dumpster its better than doing nothing. We wonder how long these upgrades will remain possible as even with Chinese plants making these boards and a handful of CRT TVs still appearing on AliBaba its clear that CRTs are at the very end of their life.\n\n"}

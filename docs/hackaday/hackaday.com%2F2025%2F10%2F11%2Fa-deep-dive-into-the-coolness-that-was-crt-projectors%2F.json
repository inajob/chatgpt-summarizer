But did you know that video projectors used to use CRTs? A trio of monochrome CRTs, in fact: one for each color; red, green, and blue. By their powers combined, these monsters were capable of fantastic resolution and image quality. Despite being nowhere near as bright as modern projectors, after being properly set up, [Technology Connections] says its still one of the best projected images he has seen outside of a movie theatre.\nAfter a twenty-minute startup to reach thermal equilibrium, one can settle down with a chunky service manual for a ponderous calibration process involving an enormous remote control. The reward is a fantastic (albeit brightness-limited) picture.\nStill, these projectors had drawbacks. They were limited in brightness, of course. But they were also complex, labor-intensive beasts to set up and calibrate. On the other hand, at least they were heavy.\n[Technology Connections] gives us a good look at the Sony VPH-D50HT Mark II CRT Projector in its tri-lobed, liquid-cooled glory. This model is a relic by todays standards, but natively supports 1080i via component video input and even preserves image quality and resolution by reshaping the image in each CRT to perform things like keystone correction, thus compensating for projection angle right at the source. Being an analog device, there is no hint of screen door effect or any other digital artifact. The picture is just there, limited only by the specks of phosphor on the face of each tube.\nConverging and calibrating three separate projectors really was a nontrivial undertaking. There are some similarities to the big screen rear-projection TVs of the 90s and early 2000s (which were then displaced by plasma and flat-panel LCD displays). Unlike enclosed rear-projection TVs, the screen for projectors was not fixed, which meant all that calibration needed to be done on-site. A walkthrough of what that process was like  done with the help of many test patterns and a remote control that is as monstrous as it is confusing  starts at 15:35 in the video below.\nLike rear-projection TVs, these projectors were displaced by newer technologies that were lighter, brighter, and easier to use. Still, just like other CRT displays, there was nothing quite like them. And if you find esoteric projector technologies intriguing, we have a feeling you will love the Eidophor.\n\n", "title": "CRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u54c1\u8cea", "body": "CRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u3060\u304c\u3001\u8a2d\u7f6e\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u3001\u8f1d\u5ea6\u3082\u4f4e\u3044\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u306f\u52a3\u308b\u304c\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["CRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u54c1\u8cea", "\u6620\u753b\u9928\u4e26\u307f\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bCRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "Sony VPH-D50HT Mark II\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u3068\u624b\u9593\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u306eCRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306b\u62bc\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3082\u8272\u892a\u305b\u306a\u3044CRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

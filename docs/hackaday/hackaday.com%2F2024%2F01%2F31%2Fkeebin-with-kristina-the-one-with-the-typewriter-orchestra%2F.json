Like, a whole lot more control? Well, thats the idea behind the Akruvia 124 Playground by [iketsj].\nImage by [iketsj] via YouTube\nThis is a 48-key ortholinear keyboard, but other than that, its a complete blank slate. The kit includes the PCB, diodes, RGB LEDs, and Kailh Choc V1 hot swap sockets, which is really the only choice you dont have in the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the rest is up to you, thanks to a generous prototyping area that wraps around three sides of the keys. Bring your own microcontroller and anything else that sounds useful, like displays, rotary encoders, gesture sensors, pointing devices, you name it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could even magnetically link a macro pad to one side, as [iketsj] teases in the intro video. [iketsj] has made the kit available through links on their website, and youll find a product guide there as well.\n\n\n\nThe Boston Typewriter Orchestra\nThe Boston Typewriter Orchestra rehearses on the sturdiest table ever made. Image via the Boston Globe\nClack, clack; ding! Clack, clack; ding! Quick, what song is that supposed to be? Well, if you heard it coming out of the Boston Typewriter Orchestra, youd instantly know it as Queens We Will Rock You. Not that they actually play that one, but I think it would sound pretty good.\nYes, the Boston Typewriter Orchestra are exactly what they sound like  a group of people banging and clanging on Royals, Underwoods, and Smith-Coronas in order to reproduce popular songs. Seemingly no typewriter surface nor function is left untouched during their performances. Even the spool covers are employed as added percussion.\nLet me just say that Im really surprised that dining room table can handle all of that stress. Regular clacking on just one typewriter of suitable weight will make a table move significantly. But eight machines being beaten on continuously? Like, where can I get one of those tables?\nThe Centerfold: Zoom75 Teal with GMK Retrowave\nImage by [2002whitegt] via redditOkay, I think this is one of my favorite centerfolds, and it has everything to do with that vaporwave desk mat from SwitchKeys. Vaporwave all the things, I say, and of course I am happy to see it extended to the keycaps.\nUnfortunately the Zoom75 from Meletrix is currently sold out in teal  isnt that always how these things go?  but we hear that it may still be possible to snag one via the site or even the companys Discord.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: The Gardner Typewriter\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nSome might think that layers on a keyboard are a relatively new idea, but they so are not. After all, capital letters technically live on another layer, though as weve seen, it wasnt always that way in the typewriter world.\nJohn Gardners 1890 typewriter consisted of a mere 14 keys, which typed 84 characters with the help of a multi-directional shift lever. This lever could move both forward and backward to type different characters, and additional characters could be typed by simultaneously depressing the shift lever and the space bar. Sounds like quite the dance, doesnt it?\nInterestingly enough, the impetus for this machine was something inexpensive that could type quickly, but it didnt really work out that way. Maybe it would have been easier to type quickly with a different type of layer-accessing mechanism. I suppose well never know.\nICYMI: Breathing Life Back Into a Butterfly\nAnyone with an appreciation for keyboards is likely aware of IBMs ThinkPad 701C laptop. This top-selling laptop of 1995 featured a special butterfly keyboard that expanded when the lid was opened and folded back in when the lid was closed.\n[John Graham-Cumming] got their hands on not one but two of these beauties, and although they were in a fairly sorry state, managed to resurrect a working machine from between the two. They even had plastic damage from old, leaky Ni-MH batteries. Only one of those beautiful keyboards was in good shape, which is sad to hear, but of course one is far better than none.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

Were all used to the slim ones about the size of a marker pen, but its a surprise to find that they also come in larger sizes equipped with colour LCD screens. [Jason Gin] received one of this type of vape, and set about reverse engineering it.\nWhat he found inside alongside the lithium-ion cell (we love his use of the term  street lithium by the way) was an ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller, 1 MB of flash, and that 80160 display. Some investigation revealed this last part to have an ST7735S controller with an SPI interface. He turned his attention to the flash, which was filled with the bitmaps for the display. Seeing an opportunity there, this lead to the creation of a Windows 95 theme for the device.\nFinally, the microcontroller turned out to be accessible with programming tools, with an unprotected firmware. The reverse engineering effort is ongoing, but we hope the result is a small dev board that will at least save some of the from being e-waste. If youre curious, all the tools used are in a GitHub repository.\nMeanwhile, weve looked at street lithium harvesting before.\nThanks [DeadFishOnTheLanding] for the tip!", "title": "\u300c\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u30d9\u30a4\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u53ce\u7a6b\u306e\u9006\u5de5\u5b66\u300d", "body": "\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u306eVAPE\u306e\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u6d41\u884c\u3002\u4e2d\u306bARM Cortex M0\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3084Flash\u3001ST7735S\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u767a\u898b\u3002Windows 95\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u6295\u5165\u3002\u672a\u3060\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002GitHub\u306b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u30d9\u30a4\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u53ce\u7a6b\u306e\u9006\u5de5\u5b66\u300d", "\u300c\u30ab\u30e9\u30fcLCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u30d9\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u8abf\u67fb\u300d", "\u300cWindows 95\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306e\u4f5c\u6210: \u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u9006\u5de5\u5b66\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u300d"]}

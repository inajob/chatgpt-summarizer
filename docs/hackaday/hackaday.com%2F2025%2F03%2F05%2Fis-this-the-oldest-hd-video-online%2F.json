Its well filmed, and as with any HD video, you can see real detail. But as you watch, you may see something a little out of the ordinary. Its got noise, a little bit of distortion, and looking closely at the surroundings, its clearly from the 1980s. Something doesnt add up, as surely wed expect a video like this to be shot in glorious 525 line NTSC. In fact, what were seeing is a very rare demo reel from 1985, and its showing off the first commercial HDTV system. This is analogue video in 1035i, and its background as listed below the video makes for a very interesting story.\nMost of us think of HDTV arriving some time in the 2000s when Blu-ray and digital broadcasting supplanted the NTSC or PAL systems. But in fact the Japanese companies had been experimenting since the 1960s, and these recordings are their first fruits. Its been digitized from a very rare still-working Sony HDV-1000 reel-to-reel video recorder, and is thus possibly the oldest HD video viewable online. Theyre looking for any HDV-1000 parts, should you happen to have one lying around. Meanwhile, the tape represents a fascinating window into a broadcast history very few of us had a chance to see back in the day.\nThis isnt the first time weve touched on vintage reel-to-reel video.\n\n"}

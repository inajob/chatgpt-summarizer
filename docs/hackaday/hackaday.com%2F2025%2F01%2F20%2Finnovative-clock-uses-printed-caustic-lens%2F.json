Digital, analog, seven-segment, mechanical seven-segment, binary, ternary, hexadecimal you name it. Its been done. You really have to try to find something that shocks us something we havent seen before. [Moritz v. Sivers] has done just that.\u00a0\nWild. Just wild.\nMeet the Caustic Clock. Its based on the innovative Hollow Clock from [shiura]. It displays time with an hour hand and a minute hand, and thats all so conventional. But what really caught our eye was the manner in\u00a0which its dial works. It uses caustics to display the clock dial on a wall as light shines through it.\nIf youve ever seen sunlight reflect through a glass, or the dancing patterns in an outdoor swimming pool, youve seen caustics at play. Caustics are the bright patterns we see projected through a transparent object, and if you shape that object properly, you can control them. In this case, [Moritz] used some GitHub code from [Matt Ferraro] to create a caustic projection clockface, and 3D printed it using an SLA printer.\nThe rest of the clock is straightforward enough\u2014theres some WS2812 LEDs involved, an Arduino Nano, and even an RP2040. But the real magic is in the light show and how its all achieved. We love learning about optics, and this is a beautiful effect well worth studying yourself.\n\n"}

Making images, making videos, and replacing most of us real human writers if you believe the hype. Maybe its all over! And yet, we persist, to write about yet another job taken over by AI: creating video games.\nThe research paper is entitled Video Game Generation: A Practical Study using Mario. The basic idea is whether a generative AI model can create an interactive video game by first training it on an existing game.\nMarioVGG, as it is called, is a text-to-video model. It hasnt built the Mario game that youre familiar with, though. It takes player commands as text inputs\u2014such as run, or jump\u2014and then outputs video frames showing the result in the game. The model was trained on a dataset of frame-by-frame Super Mario Brothers game play, combined with data on user inputs at the time. The model shows an ability to generate believable video output for given player inputs, including basic game physics, item interactions, and collisions. Its able to do this in a chained way, so that it can reasonably simulate a player making multiple actions and moving through a level of the game.\nIts not like playing a real Mario game yet, by any means. Regardless, the AI model has shown an ability to replicate the world of the game in a way that behaves relatively consistently with its established rules. If youre in the field of video game development, though, you probably dont have a lot to worry about just yet\u2014you probably moved past making basic Mario clones years ago, so youve got quite an edge for now!", "title": "AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "body": "AI\u304c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u51fa\u529b\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30c7\u30ebMarioVGG\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30a8\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306a\u6280\u8853\u9769\u65b0\u3060\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u306f\u307e\u3060 AI \u304c\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u7af6\u3044\u5408\u3046\u72b6\u6cc1\u3068\u306f\u3044\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "\u30de\u30ea\u30aaVGG: \u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6620\u50cf\u3078", "\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u751f\u6210: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7269\u7406\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bAI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0AI\u306e\u9032\u5316: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7814\u7a76", "\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a: AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u4f53\u9a13"]}

Dont bother answering that question, youre reading Hackaday so we already know the answer. We also know youre a fan of building things yourself and open source, which makes us fairly sure youll be just as interested in the recently announced ClockworkPi PicoCalc as we are.\nOn the surface, it looks like a chunky scientific calculator, though on further inspection youll note it comes equipped with a QWERTY keyboard. But open up the case and what youve really got is an elaborate carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The PicoCalc supports all variants of the microcontroller, but realistically we cant think of any reason that you wouldnt just use the latest version.\nWith the MCU connected, youll have access to the PicoCalcs 320320 4-inch IPS screen, backlit I2C-connected keyboard, SD card slot, 8 MB PSRAM, and dual PWM speakers. Power is provided by a pair of 18650 cells (which youll need to supply on your own), and the board has the necessary circuitry to charge them up over USB-C.\nEverything is housed in an injection molded case, but the project page says all the necessary CAD files will be eventually be released under the GPL v3 so you can 3D print or CNC your own enclosure. For now though, the only thing of note that seems to be in the PicoCalc GitHub repository is a PCB schematic.\nThe software side of things is a little less clear. The page mentions a BASIC interpreter, MP3 playback, and support for various programming languages, but we get the impression thats just a list of stuff you can run on the Pi Pico. There are a few images that clearly show the PicoCalc actually being used as a calculator however, so there may be an official firmware yet to be revealed.\nThe PicoCalc kit is on sale now, and will set you back $75 USD  which actually includes a first-generation Pi Pico, on the off chance that you dont already have a few laying around. Weve been impressed with the previous offerings from ClockworkPi, so assuming this new kit maintains that same build quality, it seems like a fair enough price.", "title": "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u79d1\u5b66\u96fb\u5353\u300cClockworkPi PicoCalc\u300d", "body": "ClockworkPi\u306ePicoCalc\u306fRaspberry Pi Pico\u7528\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3001$75\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u79d1\u5b66\u96fb\u5353\u300cClockworkPi PicoCalc\u300d", "- QWERTY\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- 320x320\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1IPS\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u6301\u3064PicoCalc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a", "- $75\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308bPicoCalc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u3068\u7279\u9577"]}

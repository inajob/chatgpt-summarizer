Still, that potential was surely fairly limited, as were talking about a DOS game from 30 years ago. Sure, it was limited but limits are meant to be broken, and games are made to be modded. [TedMeat] has made a video showing the updates. (Embedded below.)\nIt turns out there was a 3D-accelerated version sold with the short-lived Rendition graphics cards. That version is what let the community upscale everything to the absurd resolutions our modern monitors are capable of. Goodbye SVGA, hello HD. Specifically, [sharangad] has created a wrapper to translate the Rendition API to modern hardware. It doesnt sound like higher-res textures have been modded in, in which case this looks spectacular for graphics designed in 1995. Its not the latest Forza, but for what it is, it impresses.\nThe second hack [TedMeat] discusses is a mod by [GPLaps] that pulls physics values from game memory to throw to a modern force-feedback wheel, and it shows just how good the physics was in 1995. You really can feel whats going on stopping a skid before it starts, for example. Thats normal these days, but for the kids playing with a keyboard in 1995, it would have been totally mind-blowing.\nAs tipster [Keith Olson] put it: What can I say? Fans gonna fan!  and were just as grateful for that fact as we are for the tipoff. If youre in a fandom thats hacked its way to keep old favourites alive, wed love to hear about it: submit a tip.\n\n", "title": "- 1995\u5e74\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u300cIndycar Racing 2\u300d\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u5411\u3051\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "Indycar Racing 2\u306f\u30011995\u5e74\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u76ee\u899a\u307e\u3057\u3044\u6539\u826f\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3067\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 1995\u5e74\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u300cIndycar Racing 2\u300d\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u5411\u3051\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01Rendition\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b\uff1aHD\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u3067\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- 1995\u5e74\u306e\u7269\u7406\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4f53\u611f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u529b\u3067\u751f\u304d\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u6d3b\u52d5"]}

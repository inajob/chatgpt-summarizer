While the tools Docker provides are powerful, maintain many of the benefits of virtualization, and dont use as many system resources as a VM, it can be harder to get the hang of setting up and maintaining containers than it generally is to run a few virtual machines. If youve been hesitant to try it out, this guide to getting a Docker container up and running is worth a look.\nThe guide goes over the basics of how Docker works to share system resources between containers, including some discussion on the difference between images and containers, where containers can store files on the host system, and how they use networking resources. From there the guide touches on installing Docker within a Debian Linux system. But where it really shines is demonstrating how to use Docker Compose to configure a container and get it running. Docker Compose is a file that configures a number of containers and their options, making it easy to deploy those containers to other machines fairly straightforward, and understanding it is key to making your experience learning Docker a smooth one.\nWhile the guide goes through setting up a self-hosted document management program called Paperless, its pretty easy to expand this to other services you might want to host on your own as well. For example, the DNS-level ad-blocking software Pi-Hole which is generally run on a Raspberry Pi can be containerized and run on a computer or server you might already have in your home, freeing up your Pi to do other things. And although its a little more involved you can always build your own containers too as our own [Ben James] discussed back in 2018.", "title": "Docker\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Docker\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Docker\u306f\u4eee\u60f3\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u305c\u3072\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u3001Paperless\u3084Pi-Hole\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u30db\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Docker\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u65b9\u6cd5", "Docker Compose\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u69cb\u6210\u3068\u8d77\u52d5\u65b9\u6cd5", "Debian Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3078\u306eDocker\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u624b\u9806", "\u81ea\u5df1\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u578b\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u7ba1\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u65b9\u6cd5", "Raspberry Pi\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aPi-Hole\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u5316"]}

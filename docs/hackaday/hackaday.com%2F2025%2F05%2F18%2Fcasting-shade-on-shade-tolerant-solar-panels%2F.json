[Alex Beale] reviewed a revolutionary shade-tolerant panel by Renology in a video embedded below. The results are fascinating.\nWhile shading large portions of the panels using cardboard to cut off rows of cells, or columns of cells, the shade tolerant panel does very well compared to the standard panel but when natural, uneven shading is applied to the panel, very little difference is seen between the standard and active panels in [Alex]s test.\u00a0 We suspect there must be some active components to keep power flowing around shaded cells in the Renology panel, allowing it to perform well in the cardboard tests. When the whole panel is partially shaded, theres no routing around it, and it performs normally.\nIts hard to see a real-world case that would justify the extra cost, since most shading doesnt come with perfect straight-line cutoffs. Especially considering the added cost for this shade tolerant technology (roughly double normal panels).\nYou might see a better boost by cooling your solar panels. Of course you cant forget to optimize the output with MPPT. Its possible that a better MPPT setup might have let the Renology panel shine in this video, but were not certain. Whatever panels youre using, though, dont forget to keep them clean.\n\n", "title": "- \u65e5\u9670\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "\u30b7\u30a7\u30fc\u30c9\u8010\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306f\u5f93\u6765\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u597d\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u793a\u3059\u304c\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u5f71\u306f\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u8584\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65e5\u9670\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "- Renology\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65e5\u9670\u8010\u6027\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "- \u65e5\u9670\u304c\u53ca\u307c\u3059\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u65e5\u9670\u8010\u6027\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

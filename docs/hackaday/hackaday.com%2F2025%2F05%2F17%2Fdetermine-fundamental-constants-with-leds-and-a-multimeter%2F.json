Determining the value of them might seem like the sort of thing for large, well funded University labs, but many can be determined to reasonable accuracy on the benchtop, as [Marbs Lab] proves with this experiment to find the value of Plancks Constant.\n[Marvs Lab] setup is on a nice PCB that uses a rotary switch to select between 5 LEDs of different wavelengths, with banana plugs for the multi-meter so he can perform a linear regression on the relation between energy and frequency to find the constant. Hes also thoughtfully put connectors in place for current measurement, so the volt-current relationship of the LEDs can be characterized in a second experiment. Overall, this is a piece of kit that would not be out of place in any high school or undergraduate physics lab.\nTo use this to determine Plancks constant, you need to use Plancks relation for the energy of a photon:\nE = hf\nGet some Energies (E), get some energies (f), and bam! You can generate a value for h, Plancks constant. The energies? Well, thats a very easy measurement, but it requires some understanding of how LEDs work. [Marb] is simply measuring the voltage needed to just barely light the LED of a given frequency. (For frequency, hes relying on the LED datasheets.) That translates to the energy of the photon because it corresponds to the energy (in electron volts) required to jump electrons over the bandgap of the semiconductor in the LED thats how the light is generated. Those photons will have the energy of the gap, in theory.\nIn practice, the LEDs do not emit perfectly monochromatic light; theres a normal distribution centered on the color theyre supposed to be, but it is fairly tight. Thats probably why is able to [Marv] get to within 5% of the canonical value, which is better than wed expect.\nThis isnt the first time weve determined planks constant; its quite possible to get to much higher accuracy. The last time we featured this particular technique, the error was 11%.\n"}

While they are by no means a practical or useful means of storing data in the age of solid state storage, there is something special about the little floppy disc of magnetic film inside that iconic plastic case. Thats why we were so excited to see the tool [dbalsom] developed for printing pixel art in a floppys track timing diagrams!\nFloppy timing diagrams are usually used to analyze the quality of an individual disk. It represents flux transitions within the a single floppy tack as a 2D graph. But its also perfectly possible to paint images on a floppy this way. Granted, you cant see these images without printing out a timing diagram, but if your painting images onto a floppy, thats probably the point.\nThis is where pbm2track tool comes in handy! It takes bitmap images and encodes them onto floppy emulators, or actual floppies. The results are quite excellent, with near-perfect recreation in floppy graphical views. The results on real floppies are also recognizable as the original image. The concept is similar to a previous tool [dbalsom] created, PNG2disk\nIf you too love the nearly forgotten physical likeness of the save button, make sure to check out this modern Linux on a floppy hack next!\nThanks [gloriouscow] for the tip!", "title": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "body": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u5370\u5237\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "pbm2track\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306b\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u63cf\u304f\uff01", "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u6614\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u3092\u547c\u3073\u8d77\u3053\u3059\uff01\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u753b\u50cf", "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f"]}

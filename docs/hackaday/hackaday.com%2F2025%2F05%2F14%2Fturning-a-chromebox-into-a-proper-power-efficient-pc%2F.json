Its also undeniable that their locked-down nature forms a major obstacle and provides limited reusability.\nThat is unless you dont mind doing a bit of hacking. The Intel Core i3-8130U based Acer CXI3 Chromebox that the [Hardware Haven] YouTube channel got their mittens on is a perfect example.\nThe Acer CXI3 in all its 8th-gen Intel Core i3 glory. (Credit: Hardware Haven, YouTube)\nThis is a nice mini PC, with modular SODIMM RAM, an NVMe storage M.2 slot as well as a slot for the WiFi card (or SATA adapter). After resetting the Chromebox to its default configuration and wiping the previous user, it ran at just a few Watt idle at the desktop. As this is just a standard x86_64 PC, the only thing holding it back from booting non-ChromeOS software is the BIOS, which is where [MrChromebox]s exceedingly useful replacement BIOSes for supported systems come into play, with easy to follow instructions.\nReflashing the Acer CXI3 unit was as easy as removing the write-protect screw from the mainboard, running the Firmware Utility Script from a VT2 terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2 on boot  chronos as login) and flashing either the RW_LEGACY or UEFI ROM depending on what is supported and desired. This particular Chromebox got the full UEFI treatment, and after upgrading the NVMe SSD, Debian-based Proxmox installed without a hitch. Interestingly, idle power dropped from 2.6 Watt under ChromeOS to 1.6 Watt under Proxmox.\nIf you have a Chromebox thats supported by [MrChromebox], its worth taking a poke at, with some solutions allowing you to even dualboot ChromeOS and another OS if thats your thing.\n\n", "title": "- Acer CXI3 Chromebox\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u8853\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059", "body": "Acer\u306eChromebox\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u975eChromeOS\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["- Acer CXI3 Chromebox\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u8853\uff1a\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059", "- Google ChromeOS\u306e\u58c1\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\uff01Chromebox\u306eBIOS\u66f8\u304d\u63db\u3048\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u52b9\u7387UP\uff01Acer CXI3\u3067Proxmox\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f", "- \u6559\u80b2\u73fe\u5834\u5411\u3051Chromebox\u3092\u81ea\u4f5cPC\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u4ed5\u69d8\u306eChromebox\uff1aChromeOS\u3068\u4ed6OS\u306e\u5171\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

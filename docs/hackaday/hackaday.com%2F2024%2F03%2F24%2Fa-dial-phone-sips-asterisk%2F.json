Its rare for them to be stumped by a piece of technology, after all. [Mnutt]s 4-year-old son had no such problems when he saw rotary phones at an art exhibition, so what was a parent to do but wire the phone to an Asterisk PBX with shortcut numbers for calls to family and such essential services as a joke line, MTA status, or even a K-pop song.\nIts possible to hook up a pulse dial phone with a SLIC module and a microcontroller, but in this case, a Grandstream SIP box did the trick. These are all-in-one devices that implement a SIP client with a physical connection, and older ones will talk to pulse dialers as well as the more usual tone dialing phones. The phone in question is a vintage American model. Writing this from Europe we were surprised to find a little simpler inside than its transatlantic counterparts of the same era.\nAn Asterisk install on a Raspberry Pi completed the project, and thus it became a matter of software configuration. Its a useful run-through for Asterisk dilettantes, even if you havent got a 4-year-old. Perhaps you have an old payphone or two!", "title": "\u89aa\u5b50\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8ee2\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u96fb\u8a71", "body": "\u9ad8\u9f62\u8005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3001\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u306b\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u6e21\u3057\u3066\u756a\u53f7\u3092\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u30014\u6b73\u306e\u5b50\u4f9b\u304c\u82b8\u8853\u5c55\u3067\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3082\u56f0\u3089\u305a\u3001\u89aa\u304cAsterisk PBX\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u3084\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u756a\u53f7\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u89aa\u5b50\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8ee2\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u96fb\u8a71", "Asterisk PBX\u3068\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b", "Grandstream SIP\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u56de\u8ee2\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u5229\u7528", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fAsterisk\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u8a2d\u5b9a", "\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u5f0f\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

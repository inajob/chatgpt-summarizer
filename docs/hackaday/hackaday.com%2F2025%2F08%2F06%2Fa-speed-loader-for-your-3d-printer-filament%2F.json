Enter the speed loader from [Mr Flippant], which aims to take the pain out of this mechanically-frustrating chore.\nThe design is simple enough. Its a small handheld tool that uses a 12 VDC gear motor to drive a set of Bondtech-style drive gears that you might find in an extruder. Theyre assembled in a 3D printed housing with a microswitch to activate the motor, and a 9 volt battery to supply the juice.\nTo use the device, first thread the filament into the beginning of the Bowden tube. The idler gear is on a hinge, such that clamping it into position around the filament with the main gear activates the microswitch and turns the motor on, driving the filament all the way to the extruder. Job done! [Mr Flippant] notes that the filament should be as straight and unkinked as possible for best results, but thats good advice when 3D printing in general.\nFunnily enough, around these parts, when we talk about speed loaders, were usually discussing tapes.\n\n\n\nThanks to [LookAtDaShinyShiny] for the tip!", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u7528\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u88c5\u586b\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u624b\u52d5\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u7528\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "Bowden\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u4ea4\u63db\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u7d66\u9001\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

Instead they are all smart TVs, with an on-board computer running a custom OS with a pile of streaming apps installed. It fits an age in which linear broadcast TV is looking increasingly archaic, but it brings with it a host of new challenges.\nNormally youd expect us to launch into a story of privacy invasion from a TV manufacturer at this point, but instead weve got [Priscilla]s experience, in which her HiSense Android TV executed a denial of service on the computers on her network.\nThe root of the problem appears to be the TV running continuous network discovery attempts using random UUIDs, which when happening every few minutes for a year or more, overloads the key caches on other networked machines. The PC which brought the problem to light was a Windows machine, which leaves us sincerely hoping that our Linux boxen might be immune.\nIts fair to place this story more under the heading of bugs than of malicious intent, but even so its something that should never have made it to production. The linked story advises nobody to buy a HiSense TV, but to that wed have to doubt that other manufactures wouldnt be similarly affected.\nHeader: William Hook, CC-BY-SA 2.0.\nThanks [Concretedog] for the tip.", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8TV\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "body": "\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8TV\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u653e\u9001\u306e\u53e4\u3055\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002HiSense Android TV\u306f\u3001\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u5185\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u62d2\u5426\u653b\u6483\u3092\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u308b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u306f\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0UUID\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9023\u7d9a\u7684\u306a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a2\u7d22\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8TV\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u306eAndroid TV\u304c\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u906e\u65ad", "TV\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fb5\u5bb3\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30c7\u30cb\u30a2\u30eb\u30aa\u30d6\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u653b\u6483", "\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059TV\u306e\u554f\u984c", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9TV\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u8e0f\u307e\u3048\u308b\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u61f8\u5ff5"]}

Well, heres a design you might just want to add to your next PCB order  the STM32G4 Analog Toolkit from [Jana Marie].\nThe recommended STM32G431 is a wonderful tool for the task in particular. For a start, this board exposes nine 16-bit ADC inputs, with six of them capable of differential mode and three of them having the PGA (Programmable Gain Amplifier) feature. Theres also two 12-bit DAC pins, two timer outputs, three GPIOs, and UART with I2C for the dessert. As a bonus, it can work as a PD trigger, giving you higher-than-5V voltages out of USB-C for any experiments of yours.\nThe board requires only a few components, most of them easily solderable, with the STM32 in the TQFP32 package. The BOM is optimized, the GPIOs are used up to the max, with two spare GPIOs driving an RGB LED using a witty control scheme. Theres even a place to clip an alligator clip, in case thats what your probing hardware wants! All in all, this is a carefully crafted design certainly worth having on hand.\nMake sure to get a few of these made before you find yourself desperately needing one! That said, theres always a backup option, the venerable ATtiny85."}

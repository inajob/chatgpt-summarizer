[Ham Radio Crash Course] as approached this in a unique fashion, by running around 800 watts of 6-metre power into a vertical antenna festooned with hotdogs. Thats right, this ham is trying to cook some dawgs! Is his station producing dangerous levels of power that might cook passers-by?\nOf course, aside from a barely-warmed line along where the dogs were attached to the antenna theres no heating to be found. But we think hes trying to make the point in the video below the break about the relative pointlessness of applying RF field limits which are definitely relevant at much higher frequencies, to hams at low frequencies.\nIt leaves us curious as to how that 800 watts could be efficiently transferred into the sausages and really cook them. Strapping them to a vertical is we think the equivalent of strapping anything resistive to a conductor, they do not form a significant\u00a0 enough part of the circuit. We think that even six metres could cook a sausage if it could be efficiently coupled into it, so wed suggest putting a grounded sausage up the middle of a close-wound helix.\nIf you have any thoughts on the RF exposure calculations, or on the best way to cook a dog with 6m, wed love to hear the, in the comments. Meanwhile, this isnt the first piece of dog-based shenanigans weve brought you.\n\n"}

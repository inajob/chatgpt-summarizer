Were guessing thats in part due to the much more recent Pi Zero using the same 32-bit system-on-chip, but its still impressive that a 13-year-old single board computer still has manufacturer OS support. With so many of these early boards out there, is there much you can do with them in 2025? [Jeff Geerling] gives it a try.\nHis test Pi is unusual in itself, the 2013 blue special edition that RS gave away in a social media promotion. Sadly we didnt win one back in the day and neither did he, so he picked it up in an online auction. Were treated to some very slow desktop exploration, but its clear that this is not where the strengths of a Pi 1 lie. It was reckoned at the time to be roughly equivalent to a Pentium II or Pentium III in PC terms, so that shouldnt be a surprise. Instead he concludes that its better as a headless machine, though he notes how projects are starting to abandon 32 bit builds. The full video is below the break.\nWe asked the same question not so long ago, and the Hackaday Pi 1 now quietly analyses news content on its two-watt power budget. Its still a useful little Linux box for your script-based projects even if it will never win any speed prizes.\n\n"}

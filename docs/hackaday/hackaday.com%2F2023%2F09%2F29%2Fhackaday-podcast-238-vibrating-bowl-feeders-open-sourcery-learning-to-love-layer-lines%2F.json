From there, discussion moves on to magical part sorting, open source (eventually) plastic recycling, and the preposterously complex method newer Apple laptops use to determine if their lid is closed. Theyll also talk about the changing perceptions of 3D printed parts, a new battery tech that probably wont change the world, and a clock that can make it seem like your nights are getting longer and longer. Stick around until the end to hear about the glory days of childrens architecture books, and the origins of the humble microwave oven.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nGo ahead and download it!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 238 Show Notes:\n\u00a0News:\n\nCapsule Containing Asteroid Bennu Sample Has Landed \u2013 OSIRIS-REx Mission\n\nOSIRIS-REx Reaches Out And Touches Asteroid Bennu\n\n\nKenneth Finnegan: The Hackaday Superconference #HackerTrain\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out the form for a chance to win this weeks Whats That Sound challenge.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nFeed Your Fasteners In Line, With A Bowl Feeder\n\nDispense 60 Bolts In 2.3 Seconds\n\n\nGetting Shredded Plastic\u2026and Legs\n\nThink Globally, Build Locally With These Open-Source Recycling Machines\nDIY Injection Mold Design For The Home Shop\n\n\nThe Reverse Oscilloscope\nBeating Apple\u2019s Secret Lid Angle Sensor Calibration With Custom Tool\nProcesses, Threads, And\u2026 Fibers?\nPowder Your Prints For Baby-Smoothness\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nWill Nickel-Hydrogen Cells Be The Energy Storage Holy Grail?\nDead E.

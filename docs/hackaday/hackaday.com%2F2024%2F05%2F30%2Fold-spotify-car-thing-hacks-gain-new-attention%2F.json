Once that happens the automotive media player will officially be useless, with users being advised to literally throw them in the trash come December 10th. Call it an early Christmas present from your friends at the multi-billion dollar streaming company.\nSurely the hardware hacking community can do a bit better than that. As it turns out, theres actually been a fair amount of hacking and research done on the Car Thing, its just that most of it happened a couple years back when the device first hit the market. Things stagnated a bit in the intervening years, but now that the clock is ticking, theres far more interest in cracking open the gadget and seeing what else we can do with it.\n[lmore377]s Car Thing macropad hack from 2022.The car-thing-reverse-engineering repository on GitHub has a wealth of hardware and software information, and has been something of a rallying point for others who have been poking around inside the device. Unsurprisingly, the Car Thing runs Linux and with relatively minor work you can gain U-Boot and UART access. With just 512 MB of RAM and a Amlogic S905D2 chip thats similar to what powers the Radxa Zero, its not exactly a powerhouse. Then again, weve seen plenty of awesome projects done with less.\nIf youre more into the step-by-step approach, security researcher [Nolen Johnson] did a write-up about getting access to the Car Things internal Linux system back in 2022 thats certainly worth a look. As youd imagine, theres also a few YouTube videos out there that walk the viewer through gaining access to the hardware. This one from [Dinosaur Talks Tech] not only provides a good overview of how to get into the system, but covers flashing modified versions of the stock firmware to unlock various features and tweaking the internal Linux OS.\nInterestingly enough, while weve seen plenty of homebrew hardware players for Spotify over the years, this is the first time the Car Thing has ever crossed our path. Something tells us though that this isnt the last time well hear about this forlorn Linux gadget.\n\n"}

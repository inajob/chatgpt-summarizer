But is there anything more lovely to behold than circuit sculpture? Once again, [Mohit Bhoite] has made this process look easy like Sunday morning. This time, hes created a weather display in the form of a lander.\nThis lander runs on the Particle Photon 2, which connects over Wi-Fi and retrieves the weather forecast for the day, along with sunrise and sunset times and wind conditions. Everything is beautifully displayed on a vertically-oriented Adafruit 170320 TFT screen.\nTheres also a pulse-density microphone (PDM) breakout board and a buzzer, and the build is capped off with a red 0805 LED. Were not sure what the feet are made of, but they sure make this lander cute (and accurate).\nAll the project logs are picture-rich, which is really the most we could ask for when trying to imitate this level of greatness. This is apparently an ongoing project, and were excited for the end result, although it looks fairly complete from here.\nDo you want to bend it like Bhoite? Then be sure to check out his Hackaday Supercon talk on the subject."}

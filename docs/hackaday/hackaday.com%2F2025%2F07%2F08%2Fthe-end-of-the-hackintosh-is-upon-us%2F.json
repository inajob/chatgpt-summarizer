IBM compatibles surged in popularity, while Apple was able to more closely guard the Macintosh from imitators wanting to duplicate its hardware and run its software.\nThings changed when Apple announced it would hop aboard the x86 bandwagon in 2005. Soon enough was born the Hackintosh. It was difficult, yet possible, to run MacOS on your own computer built with the PC parts your heart desired.\nOnly, the Hackintosh era is now coming to the end. With the transition to Apple Silicon all but complete, MacOS will abandon the Intel world once more.\n\nEnd Of An Era\nmacOS Tahoe is slated to drop later this year.

The latest version of Apples full-fat operating system will offer more interface customization, improved search features, and the new attractive Liquid Glass design language. More critically, however, it will also be the last version of the modern MacOS to support Apples now aging line of x86-based computers.\nThe latest OS will support both Apple Silicon machines as well as a small list of older Macs. Namely, if youve got anything with an M1 or newer, youre onboard. If youre Intel-based, though, you might be out of luck. It will run on the MacBook Pro 16 inch from 2019, as well as the MacBook Pro 13-inch from 2020, but only the model with four Thunderbolt 3 ports. It will also support iMacs and Mac Minis from 2020 or later. As for the Mac Pro, youll need one from 2019 or later, or 2022 or later for the Mac Studio.\nBasically, beyond the release of Tahoe, Apple will stop releasing versions of its operating system for x86 systems. Going forward, it will only be compiling MacOS for ARM-based Apple Silicon machines.\nHow It Was Done\nOf course, its worth remembering that Apple never wanted random PC builders to be able to run macOS to begin with. Yes, it will eventually stop making an x86 version of its operating system, but it had already gone to great lengths trying to stop macOS from running on non-authorized hardware. The dream of a Hackintosh was to build a powerful computer on the cheap, without having to pay Apples exorbitant prices for things like hard drive, CPU, and memory upgrades. However, you always had to jump through hoops, using hacks to fool macOS into running on a computer that Apple never built.\n\nInstalling macOS on a PC takes some doing.\nGetting a Hackintosh running generally involved pulling down special patches crafted by a dedicated community of hackers. Soon after Apple started building x86 machines, hackers rushed to circumvent security features in what was then called Mac OS X, allowing it to run on non-Apple approved machines. The first patches landed just over a month after the first x86 Macs. Each subsequent Apple update to OS X locked things down further, only for the community to release new patches unlocking the operating system in quick succession. Sometimes this involved emulating the EFI subsystem which contemporary Macs used in place of a traditional PCs BIOS. Sometimes it was involved as tweaking the kernel to stick to older SSE2 instructions when Apples use of SS3 instructions stopped the operating system running on older hardware. Depending on the precise machine you were building, and the version of OS X or MacOS that you hoped to run, youd use different patches or hacks to get your machine booting, installing, and running to operating system.\nHackintosh communities maintain lists of bugs and things that dont work quite right\u2014no surprise given Apples developers put little thought into making their OS work on unofficial hardware.

Typical hurdles included having to use specific GPUs or WiFi cards, for example, since broad support for the wide range of PC parts just wasnt there. Similarly, sometimes certain motherboards wouldnt work, or would require specific workarounds to make Apples operating system happy in a particularly unfamiliar environment.\nOf course, you can still build a Hackintosh today. Instructions exist for installing and running macOS Sequoia (macOS 15), macOS Sonoma (macOS 14), as well as a whole host of earlier versions all the way back to when it was still called Mac OS X. When macOS Tahoe drops later this year, the community will likely work to make the x86 version run on any old PC hardware. Beyond that, though, the story will end, as Apple continues to walk farther into its ARM-powered future.\nUltimately, what the Hackintosh offered was choice. It wasnt convenient, but if you were in love with macOS, it let you do what Apple said was verboten. You didnt have to pay for expensive first party parts, and you could build your machine in the manner to which you were accustomed. You could have your cake and eat it too, which is to say that you could run the Mac version of Photoshop because that apparently mattered to some people. Now, all thats over, so if you love weird modifier keys on your keyboard and a sleek, glassy operating system, youll have to pay the big bucks for Apple hardware again. The Hackintosh is dead. Long live Apple Silicon, so it goes.\n"}

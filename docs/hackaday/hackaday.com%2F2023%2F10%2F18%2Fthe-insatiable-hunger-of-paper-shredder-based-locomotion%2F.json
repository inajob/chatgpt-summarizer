In this case, its an old paper shredder given wheels and a continuous line of paper to rip into.\nThe result is a device demonstrating a shredder-based form of locomotion, noisily pulling itself along by its own insatiable appetite.\nIt even looks like a robot, even though theres nothing really going on inside. It just mindlessly and noisily consumes, converting paper into shreds, moving inexorably forward and limited only by the supply of paper or the length of its power cable, whichever is shorter. Powerful artistic statement, or simple spectacle? You be the judge.\nWant to try your hand at a paper shredder-inspired piece? You can take artistic inspiration from the stock tracker that literally shreds your money when the market is down, or if youre more interested in the worky bits, make your own shredder from LEGO.\n\n"}

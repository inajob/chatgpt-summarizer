These generally operate in the visible light spectrum, but infrared ground-based telescopes can also work on Earth, assuming that you put them somewhere high in an area where the atmosphere is short on infrared-radiation absorbing moisture. The newly opened Universe of Tokyo Atacama Observatory (TAO) with its 6.5 meter silver-coated primary mirror is therefore placed on the summit of Cerro Chajnantor at 5,640 meters, in the Atacama desert in Chile.\nThis puts it only a few kilometers away from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), but at a higher altitude by about 580 meters. As noted on the University of Tokyo project site (in Japanese), the project began in 1998, with a miniTAO 1 meter mirror version being constructed in 2009 to provide data for the 6.5 meter version. TAO features two instruments (SWIMS and MIMIZUKU), each with a specific mission profile, but both focused on deciphering the clues about the Universes early history, a task for which infrared is significantly more suitable due to redshift.", "title": "\u30c1\u30ea\u306e\u30a2\u30bf\u30ab\u30de\u7802\u6f20\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3059\u308bTAO\u89b3\u6e2c\u6240", "body": "\u30c1\u30e3\u30b8\u30ca\u30f3\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u5c71\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3059\u308bTAO\n\u5730\u4e0a\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306b\u306f\u4f9d\u7136\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u5730\u4e0a\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3082\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308b\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u958b\u304b\u308c\u305f\u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u30a2\u30bf\u30ab\u30de\u5929\u6587\u53f0\uff08TAO\uff09\u306f\u30c1\u30ea\u306e\u30a2\u30bf\u30ab\u30de\u7802\u6f20\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30eb\u30de\u3088\u308a\u3084\u3084\u9ad8\u3044\u6a19\u9ad85,640\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u7f6e\u304b\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c1\u30ea\u306e\u30a2\u30bf\u30ab\u30de\u7802\u6f20\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3059\u308bTAO\u89b3\u6e2c\u6240", "TAO: \u30c1\u30ea\u306eCerro Chajnantor\u306b\u958b\u8a2d", "TAO: \u71b1\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u5730\u4e0a\u89b3\u6e2c\u6240\u306e\u8a2d\u7acb", "TAO\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30d5\u30c8\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u7126\u70b9", "TAO\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: 6.5\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u4e3b\u93e1\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

The kit also comes with wires, plugs, a breadboard, and a tool for extracting modules.\nThe Digital-Technik 2075 doesnt use the spring terminals we see in other project labs of the time, such as the Science Fair kits from Radio Shack, and it doesnt use modular Denshi blocks, such as we saw from the Gakken EX-150, but rather uses wire in conjunction with yellow plastic plugs. This seems to work well enough.\nIn the video, after showing us how to do switch debouncing, [Jason] runs us through making a counter with the digital components and then getting the counter to reset after it counts to five. This is done using NAND gates. Before he gets stuck into doing a project he takes a close look at the manual (which is in German) including some of the advertisements for other project labs from Busch which were available at the time. As he doesnt speak German [Jason] prints out an English translation of the manual before working through it.\nWeve heard from [Jason] at Hackaday in recent history when we saw his Microtronic Phoenix Computer System which referenced the 2090 Microtronic Computer System which was also made by Busch.\n\n"}

The result was a 555-equivalent circuit on a through-hole PCB, with the components nicely laid out into the ICs functional blocks. As a bonus, the PCB was attached to an 8-pin header which could be plugged right in as a direct replacement for the chip.\nFast forward a few years, and [Kelvin] needed to learn yet another EDA package; what better way than to repeat the 555 project? It was also a good time to step into SMD design, as well as add a little zazzle. While the updated circuit isnt as illustrative of the internal arrangement of the 555, the visual celebration of the triple nickel is more than worth it. And, just like the earlier version, this one has a header so you can just plug and chug  with style.\nWant to know how the 555 came to be? Weve covered that. You can also look at some basic 555 circuits to put your 555-shaped 555 to work. Weve even seen a vacuum tube 555 if thats more your thing.", "title": "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f [Kelvin Brammer]\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306fEDA\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u3068\u5b66\u751f\u3078\u306e\u6307\u5c0e\u76ee\u7684\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u3001SMD\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3002\u57fa\u677f\u306fIC\u6a5f\u80fd\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u914d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u8996\u899a\u7684\u306b\u3082\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u96e2\u6563\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b555\u30b7\u30a7\u30a4\u30d7\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068EDA\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5b66\u7fd2\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "SMD\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3055\u308c\u305f555\u76f8\u5f53\u56de\u8def", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

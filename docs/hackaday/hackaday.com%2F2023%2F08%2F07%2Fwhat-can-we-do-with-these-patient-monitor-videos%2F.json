Still, these simulated patient monitor videos on YouTube gotta be useful for something. Right?\nUploaded by [themonitorsolution], each fourteen-minute 1080p video depicts what a patient monitor would look like in various situations, ranging from an adult in stable condition to individuals suffering from ailments such as COPD and sepsis. Theres even one for a dead patient, which makes for rather morbid watching.\nNow we assume these are intended for educational purposes  throw them up on a display and have trainees attempt to diagnose whats wrong with the virtual patient. But were sure clever folks like yourselves could figure out alternate uses for these realistic graphics. They could make for an impressive Halloween prop, or maybe they are just what you need to get that low-budget medical drama off the ground, finally.\nHonestly, it seemed too cool of a resource not to point out. Besides, its exceedingly rare that we get to post a YouTube video that we can be confident none of our readers have seen beforeat the time of this writing, the channel only has a single subscriber. Though with our luck, that person will end up being one of you lot.\n\n", "title": "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u306f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u72b6\u6cc1\u3067\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u7684\u3084\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u88c5\u98fe\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30021\u4ef6\u306e\u8cfc\u8aad\u8005\u3057\u304b\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5e0c\u5c11\u306a\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u8a3a\u65ad\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52d5\u753b\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u6f14\u51fa\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u306e\u533b\u7642\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u4eee\u60f3\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u7528\u6cd5", "\u307e\u3060\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044YouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u60a3\u8005\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u52d5\u753b"]}

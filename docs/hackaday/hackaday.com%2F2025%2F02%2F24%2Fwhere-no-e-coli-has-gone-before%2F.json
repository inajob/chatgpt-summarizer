Scientists ran a two-pronged study to see how bacteria might fare on other worlds.\nWe currently define the Habitable Zone (HZ) of a planet by the likelihood that particular planet can host liquid water due to its peculiar blend of atmosphere and distance from its star. While this doesnt guarantee the presence of life, its a good first place to start. Trying to expand on this, the scientists used a climate model to refine the boundaries of the HZ for atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2\u00a0gases.\n\nOnce they determined these limits, they then mixed up some example atmospheres and subjected E. coli to the environments. Their findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.\nIf you want to look more into what might be out there, how about analyzing the WOW Signal or looking at what the Drake Equation is all about."}

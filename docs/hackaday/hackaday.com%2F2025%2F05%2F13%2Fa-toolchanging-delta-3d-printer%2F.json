Fortunately, [Ben Wolpert]\u2019s project fills that gap with a particularly elegant and precise delta toolchanger.\nThe hotend uses three steel spheres and triangular brackets to make a repeatable three-point contact with the toolhead frame, and three pairs of corresponding magnets hold it in place. The magnets aren\u2019t in contact, and the three magnets on the toolhead are mounted in a rotating ring. A motorized pulley on the printer\u2019s frame drives a cable which runs through a flexible guide and around the rotating ring.\nThe whole setup is very reminiscent of the Jubilee toolchanging system, except that in this case, the pulley rotates the ring of magnets rather than a mechanical lock. By rotating the ring of magnets about 60 degrees, the system can move the pairs of magnets far enough apart to remove the hotend without much force.\nThe rest of the toolchanging system is fairly straightforward: each tool\u2019s parking area consists of two metal posts which slot through corresponding holes in the hotend\u2019s frame, and the motherboard uses some RepRapFirmware macros to coordinate the tool changes. The only downside is that a cooling fan for the hotend still hadn\u2019t been implemented, but a desk fan seemed to work well enough in [Ben]\u2019s tests. The files for the necessary hardware and software customizations are all available on GitHub.\nWe\u2019ve only seen a similar toolchanging system for a delta printer once before, but we have seen a great variety of toolchangers on the more common Cartesian systems. Don\u2019t like the idea of changing extruders? We\u2019ve also seen a multi-extruder printer that completely eliminates tool switching.\n\n"}

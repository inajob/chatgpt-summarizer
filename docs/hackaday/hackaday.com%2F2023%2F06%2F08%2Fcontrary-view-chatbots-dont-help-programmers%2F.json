In a recent Communications of the ACM blog post, he reveals that  unlike many others  he thinks AI in its current state isnt very useful for practical programming. He was responding, in part, to another article from the ACM entitled The End of Programming, which, like many other articles, is claiming that, soon, no one will write software the way we do and have done for the last few decades. You can see [Matt Welsh] describe his thoughts on this in the video below. But [Bertrand] disagrees.\nAs we have also noted, [Bretrand] says:\nAI in its modern form, however, does not generate correct programs: it generates programs inferred from many earlier programs it has seen. These programs look correct but have no guarantee of correctness.\n\nThat wasnt our favorite quote, though. His characterization of an AI programming assistant as a cocky graduate student, smart and widely read, also quick to apologize, but thoroughly, invariably, sloppy and unreliable resonated with us, as well.\nUltimately, we think we agree with [Bertrand]  at least for now. As he points out, the iPhone wasnt well-received at first, but it grew into its own. This is the early days of AI chatbots, so perhaps they will get better. But, like any engineering project, you have to weigh the risk of being wrong with the consequence. Getting a quiz question wrong or putting a wrong hyperlink in a web page is an annoyance in most cases. Producing software thats wrong can cost millions at the bank and lives in a self-driving car.\nMaybe we expect too much. Weve seen successful cases of using chatbots as more of a junior assistant, taking on tasks like converting data, producing test cases, and other things that it seems to be good at doing. But, then again, everyone who will take your job started out as a junior assistant at some point.\n", "title": "AI\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u3001\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "body": "AI\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\u3068Bertrand Meyer\u6c0f\u304c\u4e3b\u5f35\u3002AI\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3001\u898b\u6804\u3048\u306f\u3088\u304f\u3066\u3082\u6b63\u78ba\u6027\u306f\u4fdd\u8a3c\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u6307\u6458\u3002\u958b\u767a\u8005\u304cAI\u306b\u9593\u9055\u3044\u3092\u72af\u3055\u305b\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u3001\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u6e2c\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u8a55\u4fa1\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3001\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u5909\u63db\u3084\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u751f\u6210\u306a\u3069\u3001AI\u304c\u4e0a\u624b\u306b\u3053\u306a\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8ff0\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["AI\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u3001\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u305f\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u306f\u8fd1\u3044\uff1fAI\u306b\u306f\u307e\u3060\u8ab2\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "AI\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u306a\u82e5\u624b\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\uff1f", "AI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30af\u30aa\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u6b20\u3051\u308b\u5352\u696d\u751f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8aa4\u308a\u306f\u4f55\u767e\u4e07\u3082\u306e\u8cbb\u7528\u3068\u4eba\u547d\u3092\u5931\u3046\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002"]}

Even if its a 50 cc moped, no other motorcycle you will own afterwards will give you that same hit as the first time you sit astride it and open the throttle. It has to be admitted though, that 50 cc mopeds are slow if its not your first ever ride. Really slow. How can they be made faster? Perhaps an extra cylinder will do the trick. In the video below the break, [LeDan] takes a single cylinder Simson moped engine and turns it into a 2-cylinder model.\nThe build has something of the machining porn about it, but who doesnt like to sit down and watch as rough metal is transformed into a machined finish? A second Simson engine is used as a donor, and from it another crankcase section is fabricated. In that foes a newly enlarged crankshaft which were supprised not to see being balanced, and on the end of the whole assembly goes the Simson end casting. Two cylinders and their blocks the bolt on top, and the engine is complete. Its a twin-carb model, and we have to admit curiosity as to whether small two-strokes need their carbs balancing. The result seems to work, though we dont see it on a bike or at high revs. The kid with this engine really would have the fastest motorcycle in the world  compared to his mates.\nAs you might expect, this isnt the first small engine build weve seen.\n\n", "title": "50cc\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u901f\u304f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "50cc\u306e\u30e2\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3057\u3066\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30022\u6c17\u7b52\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3059\u308b\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["50cc\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u901f\u304f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "1\u6c17\u7b52\u30922\u6c17\u7b52\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30b7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u918d\u9190\u5473\u304c\u8a70\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u6539\u9020", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u901f\u304f\u3059\u308b", "\u53cb\u9054\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u901f\u3044\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u6301\u3066\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

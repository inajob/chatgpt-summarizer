That doesnt mean that wired phones are no longer of interest to a hardware hacker though, and many of us have at times experimented with these obsolete instruments. At the recent 37C3 event in Germany, [Hans Gelke] gave a talk on the analog exchange hes created from scratch.\nThe basic form of the circuit is built around a crosspoint switch array, with interfaces for each line and a Raspberry Pi to control it all. But that simple description doesnt fully express its awesomeness, rather than hooking up a set of off-the-shelf modules hes designed everything himself from scratch. His subscriber line interface circuit uses a motor controller to generate the bell signal, his analogue splitter has an op-amp and a transistor, and his crosspoint array is a collection of JFETs. Having dabbled in these matters ourselves, its fascinating to see someone else making this work. Video below the break.\nHave an analogue phone but nowhere to use it? Bring it to a hacker camp!\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u6210\u529f\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u6709\u7dda\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u5834\u6240\u3082\u591a\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3060\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3057\u305f\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u7269\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u5f7c\u306f\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30b2\u30eb\u30b1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4ea4\u63db\u56de\u7dda\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4ea4\u63db\u56de\u7dda\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4ea4\u63db\u56de\u7dda\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

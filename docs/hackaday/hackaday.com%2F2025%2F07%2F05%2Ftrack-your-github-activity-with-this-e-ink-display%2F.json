For some of you it will show a hive of activity, while for others it will be a bit spotty. If youre proud of your graph though, youll want to show it off to the world, and thats where [HarryHighPants] Git Contributions E-Ink Display comes in. Its a small desktop appliance with a persistent display, that shows the current version of your GitHub graph.\nAt its heart is an all-in-one board with the display and an ESP32 on the back, with a small Li-Po cell. Its all put in a smart 3D printed case. The software is the real trick, with a handy web interface from which you can configure your GitHub details.\nIts a simple enough project, but it joins a growing collection which use an ESP32 as a static information display. The chip is capable of more though, as shown by this much more configurable device."}

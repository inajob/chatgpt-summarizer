For some of you it will show a hive of activity, while for others it will be a bit spotty. If youre proud of your graph though, youll want to show it off to the world, and thats where [HarryHighPants] Git Contributions E-Ink Display comes in. Its a small desktop appliance with a persistent display, that shows the current version of your GitHub graph.\nAt its heart is an all-in-one board with the display and an ESP32 on the back, with a small Li-Po cell. Its all put in a smart 3D printed case. The software is the real trick, with a handy web interface from which you can configure your GitHub details.\nIts a simple enough project, but it joins a growing collection which use an ESP32 as a static information display. The chip is capable of more though, as shown by this much more configurable device.", "title": "GitHub\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bE-ink\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "GitHub\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bE-Ink\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3001\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3002", "titles": ["GitHub\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bE-ink\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb Git Contributions \u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306eGitHub\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u8868\u793a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u30a2\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb", "GitHub\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306b\u898b\u305b\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

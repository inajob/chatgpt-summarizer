It takes the form of a large single-turn coil made into a tuned circuit with a variable capacitor, and it provides the benefits of good directionality and narrow bandwidth at the cost of some scary RF voltages and the need for constant retuning. As [VK3YE] shows us though, magnetic loops are not limited to HF  hes made a compact VHF magnetic loop using a tin can.\nIts a pretty simple design; a section from the can it cut out and made into a C shape, with a small variable capacitor at the gap. The feed comes in at the bottom, with the feed point about 20 % of the way round the loop for matching. The bandwidth is about 100 MHz starting from the bottom of the FM broadcast band, and he shows us it receiving broadcast, Airband, and 2 meter signals. It can be used for transmitting too and we see it on 2 meter WSPR, but we would have to wonder whether the voltages induced by higher power levels might be a little much for that small capacitor.\nHes at pains to point out that there are many better VHF antennas as this one has no gain to speak of, but we can see a place for it. Its tiny, if youre prepared to fiddle with the tuning its high Q gets rid of interference, and its strong side null means it can also reduce unwanted signals on the same frequency. We rather like it, and we hope you will too after watching the video below.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578bVHF\u78c1\u6c17\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u78c1\u6c17\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306fHF\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u767a\u63ee\u3057\u3001VHF\u306b\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u7c21\u6613\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u53d7\u4fe1\u3068\u9001\u4fe1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578bVHF\u78c1\u6c17\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdHF\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u5c0f\u7a7a\u9593\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u53ef\u5909\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

With many thousands of peripherals and components that can be found in a modern computer, keeping up requires either the commercial resources of Microsoft or the huge community of Linux.\nFor a small project such as SerenityOS this becomes a difficult task, and for that reason the primary way to run that OS has always been in an emulator. [Sdomi] however has other ideas, and has put a lot of effort to getting the OS to run on some real hardware. The path to that final picture of a laptop with a SerenityOS desktop is long, but it makes for a fascinating read.\nThe hardware in question is an Intel powered Dell Chromebook. An odd choice you might think, but theyre cheap and readily available, and they have some useful debugging abilities built in. Were treated to an exploration of the hardware and finding those debug ports, and since the USB debugging doesnt work, a Pi Pico clone is squeezed into the case. We like that its wired up to the flash chip as well as serial.\nGetting access to the serial port from the software turned out to be something of a pain, because the emulated UART wasnt on the port youd expect. Though its an Intel machine its not a PC clone, so it has no need. Some epic hackery involving rerouting serial to the PC debug port ensued, enabling work to start on an MMC driver for the platform. The eventual result is a very exclusive laptop, maybe the only one running SerenityOS on hardware.\nWe like this OS, and we hope this work will lead to it becoming usable on more platforms. We took a look at it back in 2023, and its good to hear that its moving forward."}

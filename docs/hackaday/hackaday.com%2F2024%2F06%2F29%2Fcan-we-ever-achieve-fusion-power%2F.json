But despite huge investment and some fascinating science, the old adage about practical power generation being 20 years away seems just as true as ever. But is that really the case? [Brian Potter] has written a review article for Construction Physics, which takes us through the decades of fusion research.\nFor a start, its fascinating to learn about the many historical fusion process, the magnetic pinch, the stelarator, and finally the basis of many modern reactors, the tokamak. He demonstrates that weve made an impressive amount of progress, but at the same time warns against misleading comparisons. Theres a graph comparing fusion progress with Moores Law that he debunks, but he ends on a positive note. Who knows, we might not need a Mr. Fusion to arrive from the future after all!\nFusion reactors are surprisingly easy to make, assuming you dont mind putting far more energy in than youd ever receive in return. Weve featured more than one Farnsworth fusor over the years.", "title": "\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u672a\u6765\u3078", "body": "\u6838\u878d\u5408\u6280\u8853\u306f\u305a\u3063\u3068\u307b\u307c\u7121\u9650\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7d04\u675f\u3092\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u767a\u96fb\u306f20\u5e74\u306e\u6b73\u6708\u3092\u8981\u3059\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u78c1\u529b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084tokamak\u3068\u3044\u3046\u53cd\u5fdc\u5668\u306a\u3069\u3067\u9032\u6b69\u306f\u3042\u308b\u3002\u6838\u878d\u5408\u7089\u306f\u88fd\u4f5c\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u304c\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u904e\u53bb\u304b\u3089\u672a\u6765\u3078", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\uff1a\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u9032\u5c55", "\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\uff1a\u73fe\u5728\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5c55\u671b", "\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30ea\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

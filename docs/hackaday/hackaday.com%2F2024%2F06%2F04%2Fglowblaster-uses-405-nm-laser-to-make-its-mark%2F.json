Well then youre in luck, as the Star Wars inspired GlowBlaster designed by [Louis Abbott] can help you realize those dreams with a real-life laser pistol  albeit a much weaker one than youd want to carry into a Mos Eisley cantina.\nInside the 3D printed frame of the GlowBlaster is a 5 mW 405 nm module, an Arduino Nano, a speaker, a vibration motor, and a 9 V battery. When you pull the trigger, it pushes down on a 12 mm tactile button which causes the Arduino to fire the laser and sprinkle in a bit of theatrics by way of the speaker and vibration motor. Theres also a second button on the side of the blaster that lets you pick between firing modes.\n\n\nThe idea behind this project is that even a momentary blast from a 405 nm laser will excite a phosphorescent material enough that it will show a hit. So all youve got to do is draw a target on a glow-in-the-dark sheet, and youll be able to see where your shots land from clear across the doom. Admittedly it will have to be a dimly lit room, but still.\nTechnically that 5 mW figure puts the GlowBlasters output on par with a laser pointer, but in the documentation, [Louis] cautions that laser modules sourced online are often more powerful than their labels claim. So you, and anyone else around, would be wise to wear eye protection while the laser is being fired.\nThis is a far simpler solution than previous laser marksmanship projects weve covered, as the target side is totally passive. Although we have to admit, seeing the target actually get knocked down is a lot of fun.\n<!--more-->\n"}

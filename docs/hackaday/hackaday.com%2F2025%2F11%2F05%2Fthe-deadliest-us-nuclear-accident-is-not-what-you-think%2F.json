However, there have been over 50 accidents of varying severity in the US, with few direct casualties. (No one died directly from the Three Mile Island incident, although there are some studies that show increased cancer rates in the area.)\nIndeed, where there are fatalities, it hasnt been really related to the reactor. Take the four people who died at the Surry Nuclear Power Plant accident: they were killed when a steam pipe burst and fatally scalded them. At Arkansas Nuclear One, a 525-ton generator was being moved, the crane failed to hold it, and one person died. That sort of thing could happen in any kind of industrial setting.\nBut one incident that you have probably never heard of took three lives as a direct result of the reactor. True, it was a misuse of the reactor, and it led to design changes to ensure it cant happen again. And while the incident was nuclear-related, the radiation didnt kill them, although it probably would have if they had survived their injuries.\nBackground\nThe large cylinder housed the SL-1 reactor. The picture is from some time before the accident (public domain).\nIt may be a misattribution, but it is often said that Napoleon said something like, An army marches on its stomach. A modern army might just as well march on electrical power. So the military has a keen interest in small nuclear reactors to both heat sites in cold climates and generate electricity when in remote locations or in, as they like to call it, denied areas.\nIn the mid-1950s, the Army tasked Argonne National Laboratory to prototype a small reactor. They wanted it portable, so it had to break down to relatively small pieces, if you consider something weighing 10 tons as small, and could be set up in the field.\nThe resulting prototype was the Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One, known as SL-1, operated by the Army in late 1958. It could provide about 400 kW of heating or 200 kW of electricity. The reactor core was rated for 3 MW (thermal) but had been tested at 4.7 MW a few times. It would end operations due to an accident in 1961.\nDesign\nSketch of the reactor internals (public domain).\nThe reactor was a conventional boiling-water reactor design that used natural circulation of light water as both coolant and moderator. The fuel was in the form of plates of a uranium-aluminum alloy.\nThe reactor was inside a 48-foot-tall cylinder 38.5 feet in diameter. It was made of quarter-inch plate steel. Because the thing was in the middle of nowhere in Idaho, this was deemed sufficient. There was no containment shell like youd find on reactors nearer to population centers.\nThe reactor, at the time of the accident, had five control rods, although it could accommodate nine. It could also hold 59 fuel assemblies, but only 40 were in use. Because of the reduced number of fuel plates, the reactors center region was more active than it would have been under full operation. The rods were eight in a circle with four dummies and a ninth one in the center. Because of the missing outer rods, the center control rod was more critical than the four others.\nThe Accident\nIn January of 1961, the reactor had been shut down for 11 days over the holiday. In preparation for restarting, workers had to reconnect the rods to their drive motors. The procedure was to pull the rod up four inches to allow the motor attachment.\nCutaway of the SL-1 and the control building (public domain).\nThere were three workers: Specialist Richard McKinley, Specialist John Byrnes, and a Navy Seabee Electrician First Class Richard Legg. Legg was in charge, and McKinley was a trainee.\nFrom a post-accident investigation, they are fairly sure that Byrnes inexplicably pulled the center rod out 20 inches instead of the requisite four inches. The reactor went prompt critical, and, in roughly four milliseconds, the 3 MW core reached 20 GW. There wasnt enough time for sufficient steam to form to trigger the safeties, which took 7.5 milliseconds.\nThe extreme heat melted the fuel, which explosively vaporized. The reactor couldnt dissipate so much heat so quickly, and a pressure wave of about 10,000 pounds hit the top of the reactor vessel. The 13-ton vessel flew up at about 18 miles an hour, and plugs flew out, allowing radioactive boiling water and steam to spray the room. At about nine feet, it collided with the ceiling and a crane and fell back down. All this occurred in about two seconds.\nAs you might imagine, you didnt want to be in the room, much less on top of the reactor. Two of the operators were thrown to the floor. Byrnes fall causes his rib to fatally pierce his heart. McKinley was also badly injured but only survived for about two hours after the accident. Legg was found dead and stuck to the ceiling, an ejected shield plug impaling him.\nWhy?\nActual photo of the destroyed reactor taken by a camera on the end of a crane.\nYou can place a lot of blame here. Of course, you probably shouldnt have been able to pull the rod up that far, especially given that it was carrying more of the load than the other rods. The contractor that helped operate the facility wasnt available around the clock due to budget reasons. Theres no way to know if that would have helped, of course.\nBut the real question is: why did they pull the rod up 20 inches instead of four? We may never know. There are, of course, theories. Improbably, people have tried to explain it as sabotage or murder-suicide due to some dispute between Byrnes and one of the other men. But that doesnt seem to be the most likely explanation.\nApparently, the rods sometimes stuck due to misalignment, corrosion, or wear. During a ten-month period, for example, about 2.5% of the drop-and-scram tests failed because of this sticking: a total of 40 incidents. However, many of those causes only apply when the rods are automatically moved. Logbooks showed that manual movement of the rods had been done well over 500 times. There was no record of any sticking during manual operations. Several operators were asked, and none could recall any sticking. However, the rate of sticking was increasing right before the incident, just not from manual motion.\nHowever, it is easy to imagine the 48-pound rod being stuck, pulling hard on it, and then having it give way. Weve all done something like that, just not with such dire consequences.\nAftermath\nFirst responders had a difficult time with this incident due to radiological problems. There had been false alarms before, so when six firefighters arrived on the scene, they werent too concerned. But when they entered the building, they saw radiation warning lights on and their radiation detectors pegged.\nEven specialized responders with better equipment couldnt determine just how much radiation was there, except for plenty. Air packs were fogging, limiting visibility. During the rescue of McKinley, one rescuer had to remove a defective air pack and breathe contaminated air for about three minutes. Freeing Leggs body required ten men working in pairs, because each team could only work in the contaminated zone for 65 seconds. The rule had been that you could tolerate 100 Ro\u0308ntgens (about 1 Sv or 100 rem) to save a life and 25 (0.25 Sv or 25 rem) to save valuable property. Of the 32 people involved in the initial response, 22 received between 3 and 27 Ro\u0308ntgens exposure. Further, 790 people were exposed to harmful radiation levels during the subsequent cleanup.\nThe reactor building did prevent most of the radioactive material from escaping, but iodine-131 levels in some areas reached about 50 times normal levels. The remains of the site are buried nearby, and thats the source of most residual radiation.\nLessons Learned\nUnsurprisingly, the SL-1 design was abandoned. Future designs require that the reactor be safe even if one rod is entirely removed: the so-called one stuck rod rule. This also led to stricter operating procedures. Whats more, it is now necessary to ensure emergency responders have radiation meters with higher ranges. Regulations are often written in blood.\nThe Atomic Energy Commission made a film about the incident for internal use but, of course, now, you can watch it from your computer, below.\n\nYou might also enjoy this presentation by one of the first responders who was actually there, which you can see below.

We are always surprised at how many ordinary mistakes happen at reactors like Browns Ferry.", "title": "SL-1\u539f\u5b50\u7089\u4e8b\u6545\u306e\u771f\u5b9f: \u4e0d\u904b\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u62db\u3044\u305f\u60e8\u5287", "body": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306b\u306f50\u4ef6\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u4e8b\u6545\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001SL-1\u3067\u306f\u64cd\u4f5c\u30df\u30b9\u30673\u4eba\u304c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["SL-1\u539f\u5b50\u7089\u4e8b\u6545\u306e\u771f\u5b9f: \u4e0d\u904b\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u62db\u3044\u305f\u60e8\u5287", "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u6838\u4e8b\u6545\u306e\u6b74\u53f2: \u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3068SL-1\u306e\u6559\u8a13", "\u6838\u53cd\u5fdc\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027: SL-1\u4e8b\u6545\u304c\u6b8b\u3057\u305f\u5f71\u97ff", "\u4eba\u70ba\u7684\u30df\u30b9\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u305f\u6838\u4e8b\u6545: SL-1\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b", "\u5c0f\u578b\u539f\u5b50\u7089\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6559\u8a13: SL-1\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3093\u3060\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u6e96"]}

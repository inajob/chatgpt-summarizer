All of our understanding of electronics hinges on Maxwells equations, but not many people know them. Even fewer have an intuitive feel for the equations, and [Ali] wants to help you with that. Of course, Maxwells gets into some hairy math, but [Ali] covers each law in a very pragmatic way, as you can see in the video below.\nWhile the video explains the math simply, youll get more out of it if you understand vectors and derivatives. But even if you dont, the explanations provide a lot of practical understanding\nUnderstanding the divergence and curl operators is one key to Maxwells equations. While this video does give a quick explanation, [3Blue1Brown] has a very detailed video on just that topic. It also touches on Maxwells equations if you want some reinforcement and pretty graphics.\nMaxwells equations can be very artistic. This is one of those topics where math, science, art, and history all blend together.\n\n"}

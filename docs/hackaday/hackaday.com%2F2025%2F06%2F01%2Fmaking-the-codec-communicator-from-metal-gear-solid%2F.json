His latest build aimed to bring the Codec from Metal Gear Solid to life.\nIf you havent played the Metal Gear games, the Codec has been modelled somewhat like an advanced walkie talkie at times, but has often been kept off-screen. Thus, [3DSage] had a great deal of creative latitude to create a realistic-feeling Codec device that provided voice communications and some simple imagery display.\nThe resulting build relies on an RP2040 microcontroller to run the show. Its paired with an MPU6050 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer for motion control of the devices functionality, and features a small LCD screen to mimic the display in the games. A kids walkie-talkie kit was leveraged for audio communication, but kitted out with a better microphone than standard. Power is via a rechargeable 9V battery, which is really a lithium-ion and USB charging board packed into the familiar 9V form factor.\nWhere the build really shines, though, is the aesthetic. [3DSage] managed to capture the military-like look and feel as well as authentically recreate the graphics from the games on the screen. The simulated noise on the display is particularly charming. Beyond that, the 3D-printed enclosures leverage texture and multi-color printing really well to nail the fit and finish.\nUltimately, the Codec isnt much more than a glorified walkie talkie. Even still, [3DSage] was able to create an impressive prop that actually does most of what the device can do in game. If youve ever coveted a PipBoy or tricorder, this is one project youll be able to appreciate.\n\n", "title": "- \u6620\u753b\u3084\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3055\uff1aMetal Gear\u306eCodec\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "body": "3DSage\u306f\u6620\u753b\u3084\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u306f\u300c\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30ae\u30a2\u300d\u306eCodec\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6620\u753b\u3084\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3055\uff1aMetal Gear\u306eCodec\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01", "- RP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306aCodec\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bCodec\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u69cb\u9020", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u8ecd\u4e8b\u98a8\u306eCodec\u5916\u88c5\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306aCodec\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

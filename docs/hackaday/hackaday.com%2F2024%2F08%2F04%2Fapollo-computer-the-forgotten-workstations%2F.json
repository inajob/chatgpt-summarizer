They were one of the first graphical workstation vendors in the 1980s, and at the time were competitors to Sun Microsystems.\nBut thats enough dry historical context. Feast your eyes on this full-color, 26-page product brochure straight from 1988 for the Series 10000 Personal Supercomputer featuring multiple processors and more! Its loaded with information about their hardware and design architecture, giving a unique glimpse into just how Apollo was positioning their offerings, and the markets they were targeting with their products.\nApollo produced their own hardware and software, which meant much of it was proprietary. Whatever happened to Apollo? They were acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1989 and eventually shuttered over the following decade or so. Find yourself intrigued? [Jim Rees] of The Apollo Archive should be your next stop for everything Apollo-oriented.\nVintage computing has a real charm of its own, but no hardware lasts forever. Who knows? Perhaps we might someday see an Apollo workstation brought to life in VR, like we have with the Commodore 64 or the BBC Micro (which even went so far as to sample the sound of authentic keystrokes. Now thats dedication.)"}

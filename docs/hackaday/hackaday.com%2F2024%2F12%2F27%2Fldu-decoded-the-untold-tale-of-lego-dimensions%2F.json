Enter LDUs  LEGO Draw Units  the minuscule measurement standard that allows those tiny interlocking pieces to fit together seamlessly. In a recent video [Brick Sculpt] breaks down this fascinating topic.\nSo, what is an LDU precisely? It\u2019s the smallest incremental size used to define LEGO\u2019s dimensions. For context, a standard LEGO brick is 20 LDUs wide, and a single plate is 8 LDUs tall. Intriguingly, through clever combinations of headlight bricks, jumper plates, and even rare Minifig neck brackets, builders can achieve offsets as tiny as 1 LDU! That\u2019s the secret sauce behind those impossibly detailed LEGO creations.\nWe already knew that LEGO is far more than a toy, but this solidifies that theory. It\u2019s a means of constructing for anyone with an open mind  on its own scale. The video below explains in detail how to achieve every dimension possible. If that inspires you to build anything, dive into these articles and see if you can build upon this discovery!\n\n"}

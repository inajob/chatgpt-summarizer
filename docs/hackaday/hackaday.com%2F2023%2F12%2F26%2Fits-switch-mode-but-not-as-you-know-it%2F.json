But thats not to say that its a new idea, and on the way to todays high-frequency devices there have been quite a few steps. An earlier one is the subject of a teardown video from [Thomas Scherrer OZ2CPU], as he takes a look at a 1960s HP power supply with a slightly different approach to regulation for the day. Instead of a linear regulator on its conventional transformer and rectifier circuit, it has a pair of SCRs in the mains supply that chop at mains frequency. Its a switch mode supply, but not quite as youre used to.\nIn fact, these circuits using an SCR or a triac werent quite as uncommon as you might expect, and could at one point be found in almost every domestic TV set or light dimmer. Sometimes referred to as chopper supplies, they represented a relatively cheap way to derive a regulated DC voltage from an AC mains source in the days before anyone cared too much about RF emissions, and though few were as high quality as the HP shown in the video below, they were pretty reliable.\nIf older switchers interest you, this is not the first one weve shown you from that era.\n\n", "title": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u64a4\u53bb\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8997\u3044\u305f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u8abf\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002SCR\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u56de\u8def\u306f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u64a4\u53bb\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01", "\u65e7\u5f0f\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308d\u3046\uff01", "SCR\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u73fe\u5728", "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u81f3\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u4e00\u4f8b"]}

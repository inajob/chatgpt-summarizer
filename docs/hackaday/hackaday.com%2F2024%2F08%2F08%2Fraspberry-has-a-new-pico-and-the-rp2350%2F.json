Its standout features were the programmable input/output units (PIOs) which enabled all sorts of custom real-time shenanigans. And that\u2019s not to discount the impact of the Pi Pico, the $4 dev kit built around it.\nToday, they\u2019re announcing a brand-new microcontroller: the RP2350. It will come conveniently packaged in the new Pi Pico 2, and there\u2019s good news and bad news. The good news is that the new chip is better in every way, and that the Pico form factor will stay the same. The bad news? It\u2019s going to cost 25% more, coming in at $5. But in exchange for the extra buck, you get a lot.\nFor starters, the RP2350 runs a bit faster at 150 MHz, has double the on-board RAM at 520 kB, and twice as much QSPI flash at 4 MB. And those sweet, sweet PIOs? Now it has 12 instead of just 8. (Although we have no word yet if there is more program space per PIO \u2013 even with the incredibly compact PIO instruction set, we always wanted more!)\nTwo flavors on the same chip: Arm and RISC\nAs before, it\u2019s a dual-core chip, but now the cores are Arm Cortex M33s or RISC-V Hazard3s. Yes, you heard that right, there are two pairs of processors on board. Raspberry Pi says that you\u2019ll be able to select which style of cores runs either by software or by burning one-time fuses. So it\u2019s not a quad core chip, but rather your choice of two different dual cores. Wild!\nRaspberry Pi is also making a big deal about the new Arm TrustZone functionality. It has signed boot, 8 kB of OTP key-storage memory, SHA-256 acceleration, a hardware RNG, and \u201cfast glitch detectors\u201d. While this is probably more aimed at industry that the beginning hacker, we\u2019re absolutely confident that some of you out there will put this data-safe to good use.\nThere is, as of yet, no wireless built in. We can\u2019t see into the future, but we can see into the past, and we remember that the original Pico was wireless for a few months before they got the WiFi and Bluetooth radio added into the Pico W. Will history repeat itself with the Pico 2?\nWe\u2019re getting our hands on a Pico 2 in short order, and we\u2019ve already gotten a sneak peek at the extensive software toolchain that\u2019s been built out for it. All the usual suspects are there: Picotool, TinyUSB, and OpenOCD as we write this. We\u2019ll be putting it through its paces and writing up all the details next week."}

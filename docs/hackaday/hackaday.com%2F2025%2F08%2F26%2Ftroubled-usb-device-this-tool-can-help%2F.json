This Tool Can Help", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2025/08/26/troubled-usb-device-this-tool-can-help/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/usb-tester-1200.jpg", "original_content": "You know how it goes  some gadgets stick around in your toolbox far longer than reason dictates, because maybe one day you\u2019ll need it. How many of us held onto ISA diagnostic cards long past the death of the interface?\nBut unlike ISA, USB isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Which is exactly why this USB and more tester by [Iron Fuse] deserves a spot in your toolbox. This post is not meant to directly lure you into buying something, but seen how compact it is, it would be sad to challenge anyone to reinvent this wheel, instead of just ordering it.\nSo, to get into the details. This is far from the first USB tester to appear on these pages, but it is one of the most versatile ones weve seen so far. On the surface, it looks simple: a hand-soldered 14\u00d717 cm PCB with twelve different connectors, all broken out to labelled test points. Hook up a dodgy cable or device, connect a known-good counterpart, and the board makes it painless to probe continuity, resistance, or those pesky shorts where D+ suddenly thinks it\u2019s a ground line.\nYou\u2019ll still need your multimeter (automation is promised for a future revision), but the convenience of not juggling probes into microscopic USB-C cavities is hard to overstate. Also, if finding out whether you have a power-only or a data cable is your goal, this might be the tool for you instead."}

As long as you temper your expectations, theres plenty of material to cut with your 40 watt CO2 laser or at least engrave\u2014just not glass; thats a tough one.\nOr is it? According to [rschoenm], all it takes to engrave glass is a special coating. The recipe is easy: two parts white PVA glue, one part water, and two parts powdered titanium dioxide. The TiO2 is the important part; it changes color when heated by the laser, forming a deep black line that adheres to the surface of the glass. The glue is just there as a binder to keep the TiO2 from being blasted away by the air assist, and the water thins out the goop for easy spreading with a paintbrush. Apply one or two coats, let it dry, and blast away. Vector files work better than raster files, and youll probably have to play with settings to get optimal results.\nWith plain float glass, [rschoenm] gets really nice results. He also tried ceramic tile and achieved similar results, although he says he had to add a drop or two of food coloring to the coating so he could see it against the white tile surface. Acrylic didnt work, but there are other methods to do that.\n\n\nThanks to [AbraKadabra] for the tip."}

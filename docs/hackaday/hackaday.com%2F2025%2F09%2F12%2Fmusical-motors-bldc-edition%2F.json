In this case, [SIROJU] is tickling the ivories with a Brushless DC motor, or BLDC.\u00a0\nTo listen to a performance, jump to 6:27 in the embedded video. This BLDC has a distinctly chip-tune like sound, not entirely unlike other projects that make music with stepper motors. Unlike most stepper-based instruments weve seen [SIROJU]s BLDC isnt turning as it sings. Hes just got it vibrating by manipulating the space vector modulation that drives the motor  he gets a response of about 10 kHz that way. Not CD-quality, no, but plenty for electronic music. He can even play chords of up to 7 notes at a time.\nTheres no obvious reason he couldnt embed the music into a proper motor-drive signal, and thus allow a drone to hum its own theme song as it hovers along. Hes certainly got the chops for it; if you havent seen [SIROJU]s videos on BLDC drivers on YouTube, you should check out his channel. Hes got a lot of deep content about running these ubiquitous motors. Sure, we could have just linked to him showing you how to do FOC on an STM32, but making it sing is an expression for mastery in English, and a lot more fun besides.\nThere are other ways to make music with motors. If you know of any others, dont hesitate to send us a tip.\n\n"}

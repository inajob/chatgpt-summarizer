Kudos go to those who attempt to recreate these virtual props and bring them into the real world, but our highest praise goes to those who not only make a game-realistic version of a prop, but make it actually work.\nTake the Nokota Manufacturing radio from Cyberpunk 2077, for instance. [Taylor] took one look at that and knew it would be the perfect vessel for a Baofeng UV-5R, the dual-band transceiver that amateur radio operators love to hate. The idea is to strip the PCB out of a Baofeng  no worries, the things cost like $25  and install it in a game-accurate 3D printed case. But this is far from just a case mod, since [Taylor]s goal is to replace the radios original controls with something closer to whats in the game.\nTo that end, [Taylor] is spinning up an interface to the stock radios keypad using some 7400-series bilateral analog switches. Hooked to the keypad contacts and controlled by a Mini MEGA 2560 microcontroller, the interface is able to send macros that imitate the keypresses necessary to change frequencies and control the radios settings, plus display the results on the yellow OLED screen that seems a dead-ringer for the in-game display. The video below shows some early testing of the interface.\nWhile very much still a work in progress, weve been following [Taylor]s project for a week or so and hes really gaining some ground. Weve encouraged him to enter this one in the Cyberdeck Challenge weve got going on now; it might not have much deck going for it, but it sure does have a lot of cyber.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af2077\u300d\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Baofeng UV-5R\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "body": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u4f5c\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3001Baofeng UV-5R\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5916\u3057\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5fe0\u5b9f\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u30027400\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3001\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u5909\u66f4\u3084\u8a2d\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u307e\u3060\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u3060\u304c\u3001\u9032\u5c55\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af2077\u300d\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Baofeng UV-5R\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u30df\u30cb\u30e1\u30ac2560\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\uff01\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af2077\u300d\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u98a8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3068\u540c\u3058\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\uff01\u300c\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af2077\u300d\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u5b9f\u6a5f\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

But still they keep coming, and its inevitable that there will one or two that break through the practicality barrier and really do deliver on their promise. Which brings us tot he story which has come our way today, the suggestion that something as simple as rock salt could triple the energy density of a lithium-ion vehicle battery. Of course, we want to know more!\nThe research led from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory started around the use of cobalt in the battery cathode, an expensive and finite resource with the added concern of being in large part a conflict mineral from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cobalt is used in\u00a0 the cathodes because its oxide crystals form a stable layered structure into which the lithium ions can percolate. Alternative layered-structure metal oxides perform less well in retaining the lithium ions, making them unsuccessful substitutes. It seems that the three-dimensional structure of a rock salt crystal performs up to three times better than any layered oxide, which is where the excitement comes from.\nOf course, if it were that simple wed all be using three-times-more-powerful, half-price 18650s right now, which of course we arent. The challenge comes in making a rock salt cathode which both holds the lithium ions, and keeps that property reliably over the thousands of charge cycles needed for a real-world application. This one may yet be anther dollar on that metaphorical pile, but it just might give us the batteries weve been looking for.\nOf course, when youre looking at exciting battery chemistry, why limit yourself to lithium?", "title": "\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30eb\u30c8\u304c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u8eca\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5bb9\u91cf\u30923\u500d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b", "body": "\u77f3\u5869\u304c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u5bc6\u5ea6\u30923\u500d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8a71\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\u306e\u969c\u5bb3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u3001\u3053\u306e\u77f3\u5869\u30ab\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u6709\u671b\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30eb\u30c8\u304c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u8eca\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5bb9\u91cf\u30923\u500d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u306b\u306a\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7d20\u6750\u3001\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "\u30b3\u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u958b\u767a\u3001\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u6709\u671b\u306a\u7d20\u6750\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d6e\u4e0a", "\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30eb\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\u3078\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u96fb\u6c60\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8cea\u306b\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

A choke is an inductor in an audio (or any other) circuit designed to, well, choke off higher-than-desired frequencies. We featured a deep dive a few years back if youre interested. An inductor is a coil of wire, usually (but not necessarily) wound around a core of iron or ferrite. A transformer? Well, thats also a coil of wire around a core plus an extra coil of wire. So when [KenS], back in his salad days, had a tweeter that a was a little too tweety, and no proper choke, he grabbed a transformer instead.\nThis is where inspiration hit: sure, if you leave the second winding open, the transformer acts like a standard choke. What happens if you short that second winding? Well, you dampen the response of the first winding, and it stops choking, to the point that it acts more like a straight wire. What happens if you dont short the second winding, but dont leave it wide open? [KenS] stuck a potentiometer on there, and found it made a handy-dandy variable choke with which to perfectly tune the tone response of his speakers. Changing the resistance changes the rate at which high frequencies are choked off, allowing [KenS] to get the perfect frequency response with which to rock out to Simon  Garfunkel, The Carpenters and The Guess Who. (According to the Billboard Top 100 for 1970, those are who youd be listening to if you had conventional tastes.)\nWhile we cant say the transformer is really being tortured in this unusual mode, its certainly not how it was designed, so would qualify for the Junk Box Substitutions category of the Component Abuse Challenge. If youve made similar substitutions youd like to share, dont wait another 55 years to write them up the contest closes November 11th.\nTransformer image: Hannes Grobe, CC BY-SA 4.0.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- 55\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5909\u52d5\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "55\u5e74\u524d\u3001[KenS]\u304c\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u53ef\u5909\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3002\u97f3\u8cea\u8abf\u6574\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["- 55\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5909\u52d5\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u8cea\u8abf\u6574\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u53ef\u5909\u30c1\u30e7\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b", "- \u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u52df\u96c6"]}

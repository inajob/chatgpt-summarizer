Perhaps a few still etch their own boards, but many hobbiest were happy to put away their ferric chloride. Theres another way to make PCBs, though, which is to mill them. [Tom Nixon] has made a small CNC mill for that purpose, and its rather beautiful.\nIn operation its a conventional XYZ mechanism, with a belt drive for the X and Y and a lead screw for the Z axis. The frame is made from aluminium extrusion, and the incidental parts such as the belt tensioners are 3D printed. The write-up is very comprehensive, and takes the reader through all the stages of construction. The brains of the outfit is a Creality 3D printer controller, but he acknowledges that its not the best for the job.\nIts certainly not the first PCB router weve seen, but it may be one of the nicer ones. If you make a PCB this way, you might like to give it professional-looking solder mask with a laser.", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cCNC\u30df\u30eb\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044PCB\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u624b\u9803\u306aPCB\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001CNC\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cCNC\u30df\u30eb\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044PCB\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u7cbe\u5de7\u306aPCB\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u306ePCB\u5236\u4f5c\u304c\u3082\u3063\u3068\u4fbf\u5229\u306b\uff01CNC\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- Ferric chloride\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044PCBs\u88fd\u9020\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- Creality 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u306ePCB\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc"]}

But in more remote regions like the Himalayas, reliable electricity isnt a given. A group of local craftspeople, researchers, and operators in Nepal have worked together to devise a modular waterwheel system.\nBased on a 20-30 cm-wide bucket module consisting of only four galvanized steel components, the wheels can be easily built and deployed using resources and tools that are easy to find anywhere in the world. Current test devices generate between 120 and 1,400 Watts of power, depending on the devices size.\nA software tool was also developed that takes the head and flow rate of a location as inputs to calculate the dimensions of the optimal wheel and expected power output for an installation. This lets communities find ideal sites for power generation and calculate the expected costs.\nWeve covered a few other DIY hydropower setups, from repurposed washing machines to custom scratch builds."}

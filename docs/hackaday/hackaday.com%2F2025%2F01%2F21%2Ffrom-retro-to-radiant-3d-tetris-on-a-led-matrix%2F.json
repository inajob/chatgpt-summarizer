Enter [Markus] adaptation of 3D Tetris on a custom-built 3x3x12 RGB LED matrix. Developed as a university project, this open-source setup combines coding, soldering, and 3D printing. It\u2019s powered by an ESP32 microcontroller with gameplay controlled by a neat web interface.\nThis 3D build makes the classic game so much harder to play, that one could argue whether its still a game, or has turned into a form of art. Although it is challenging to rotate and drop blocks on such a small scale, for die-hard Tetris fans (and we know you\u2019re out there), there is always someone up to become best at it. Just look at the FastLED-powered light show, the responsive web-based GUI, and fully modular 3D printed housing, this project is a joy to look at even when nobody is playing it. Heck, a game that turned 40 only a year ago should be so mature to entertain itself, shouldnt it?\nFrom homemade Pong tables to LED cube displays, hobbyists keep finding ways to give classic games a futuristic twist. Projects like this are about pushing boundaries. Hackaday\u2019s archives are full of similar innovations, but why not craft some new ones?\n\n", "title": "- \u72ec\u81ea\u5236\u4f5c\u306e3D\u30c6\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\uff1aRGB LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6b21\u5143", "body": "3D\u30c6\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\u304cRGB LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002\u82b8\u8853\u7684\u306a\u6311\u6226\u3002", "titles": ["- \u72ec\u81ea\u5236\u4f5c\u306e3D\u30c6\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\uff1aRGB LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6b21\u5143", "- ESP32\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u30803D\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u878d\u5408\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u82b8\u8853\u7684\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u305f\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "- DIY\u611b\u597d\u8005\u304c\u6311\u3080\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u306f"]}

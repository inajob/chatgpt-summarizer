Theres a bench of sorts upon which the captive can sit, and with some effort, shuffle the surrounding frame awkwardly about. The scale of the Dalek is impressive, but it was clear the effect of human-powered locomotion was lacking. The solution was to install wheelchair motors, tires, and an ESP32-based remote control.\nQuite a lot of work went into mounting the motors and wheels, and the challenges will be familiar to anyone who has done hobby robotics. One can choose ideal motors and wheels, but making them fit one another can be an entirely different story. Shafts and hubs are of different sizes, motor mounting doesnt quite match the platform, and its all a bit like fitting a square peg into a round hole. But with access to the right tools, its nothing a little metalwork and welding cant solve.\nFor the control system, the ESP32 (with a beautiful CNC-routed custom PCB) sets itself up as a wireless access point that serves a web-based control panel for piloting, and controls two H-bridges to drive the motors. Whats more, it also provides a sound board from which a second operator can trigger appropriate phrases and sounds from the Dalek.\nSome folks prefer their remote-controlled Daleks plush and cute instead of large and looming, but we like the smooth movement and imposing stature of this one. Watch it all in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n", "title": "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6728\u88fd\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff01", "body": "\u53cb\u4eba\u304c\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u6728\u88fd\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6728\u88fd\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff01", "- \u96e3\u95a2\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u305f\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u88fd\u4f5c\u8a18", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u4eba\u3092\u4e57\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u306e\u52d5\u529b\u5316\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8", "- CNC\u52a0\u5de5\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3067\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30af\u3092\u64cd\u308b\uff01"]}

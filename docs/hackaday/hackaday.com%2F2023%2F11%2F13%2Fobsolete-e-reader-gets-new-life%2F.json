But for all their perks, there are still plenty of reasons to maintain a library of bound paper volumes. For those who have turned back to books or whose e-readers arent getting the attention they once did, there are plenty of things to do with them like this e-book picture frame.\nThe device started life as a PocketBook Basic Touch, or PocketBook 624, a fairly basic e-reader from 2014, but at its core is a decent ARM chip that can do many more things than display text. It also shipped running a version of Linux, which made it fairly easy to get a shell and start probing around. Unlike modern smart phones this e-reader seems to be fairly open and able to run some custom software, and as a result there are already some C++ programs available for these devices. Armed with some example programs, [Peter] was able to write a piece of custom software that displays images from an on-board directory and mounted the new picture display using an old book.\nThere were a number of options for this specific device that [Peter] explored that didnt pan out well, like downloading images from the internet to display instead of images on the device, but in the end he went with a simpler setup to avoid feature creep and get his project up and running for #inktober, a fediverse-oriented drawing challenge that happened last month. While not strictly in line with a daily piece of hand-drawn artwork, the project still follows the spirit of the event. And, for those with more locked-down e-readers theres some hope of unlocking the full functionality of older models with this FOSS operating system.", "title": "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30d4\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u300d- \u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30ea\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u672c\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30d4\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u300d- \u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30ea\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u98fe\u308b\u300d- \u65e7\u578b\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u597d\u304d\u306a\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u8868\u793a\u300d- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eOS\u3067\u30a2\u30f3\u30ed\u30c3\u30af", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u300d- DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0"]}

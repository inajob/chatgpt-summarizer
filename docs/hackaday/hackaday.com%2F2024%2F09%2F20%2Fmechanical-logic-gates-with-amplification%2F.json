For teaching something thats almost always invisible, educators have come up with a number of analogies for helping students understand the inner workings of this mysterious phenomenon like the water analogy or mechanical analogs to electronic circuits. One of [Thomas]s problems with most of these devices, though, is that they dont have any amplification or fan-out capability like a real electronic circuit would. Hes solved that with a unique mechanical amplifier.\nDigital logic circuits generally have input power and ground connections in addition to their logic connection points, so [Thomas]s main breakthrough here is that the mechanical equivalent should as well. His uses a motor driving a shaft with a set of pulleys, each of which has a fixed string wrapped around the pulley. That string is attached to a second string which is controlled by an input. When the input is moved the string on the pulley moves as well but the pulley adds a considerable amount of power to to the output which can eventually be used to drive a much larger number of inputs. In electronics, the ability to drive a certain number of inputs from a single output is called fan-out and this device has an equivalent fan-out of around 10, meaning each output can drive ten inputs.\n[Thomas] calls his invention capstan lever logic, presumably named after a type of winch used on sailing vessels. In this case, the capstan is the driven pulley system. The linked video shows him creating a number of equivalent circuits starting with an inverter and working his way up to a half adder and an RS flip-flop. While the amplifier pulley does take a minute to wrap ones mind around, it really helps make the equivalent electronic circuit more intuitive. Weve seen similar builds before as well which use pulleys to demonstrate electronic circuits, but in a slightly different manner than this build does.\n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "\u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3084\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u306f\u76ee\u306b\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u306f\u6c34\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3084\u6a5f\u68b0\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u751f\u5f92\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002\u30d7\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u6a5f\u68b0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u3068\u540c\u7b49\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5c55\u793a", "\u300c\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u30fb\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u767a\u660e", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

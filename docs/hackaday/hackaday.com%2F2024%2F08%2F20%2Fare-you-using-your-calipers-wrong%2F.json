However, smaller parts, the widespread use of 3D printers and machining tools, and  frankly  cheap imported calipers have made them as commonplace as an ordinary ruler in most shops. But are you using yours correctly? [James Gatlin] wasnt and he wants to show you what he learned about using them correctly.\nThe video that you can see below covers digital and vernier calipers. You might think digital calipers are more accurate, in practice, they are surprisingly accurate, although the digital units are easier to read.\n\nRegardless of how you read them, there are four main methods of using the device. The big jaws measure the outside of things, and the tips on the other side can measure inner spaces. The video shows how to line up for the best accuracy.\nThe depth and step measurements are also common features and require care to position correctly, depending on what you are measuring. The step measurement is one we always forget about.\nWe didnt realize that when you see CE on the back of your calipers, it might mean conformit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne to reflect standards compliance, or China Export which means well, probably nothing other than it came from China. How do you tell the difference? The video shows you.\nIf you have digital calipers, why not hack them? Theres more than one tweak you can make to them.\n"}

If youd like to try and predict when its going to occur, you might like this project from [Mohammad Nihal].\nWhen rain is particularly acidic, its usually because of the combination of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide and moisture in the atmosphere. This combination ends up making sulfuric acid or nitric acid that then falls to the ground as precipitation. The low-pH rain that results can harm ecosystems, melt statues, and just generally give everyone a hard time.\n[Mohammed] decided to try and predict acid rain by building a simple device based on an Arduino Nano. It records SO2 levels with an MQ-136 gas sensor, and NO2 levels with an unspecified MEMS-based sensor. Theres also a DHT11 temperature  humidity sensor in the mix, which is important since moisture content plays a role. The Arduino reads these sensors and uses a simple predictive algorithm to create an Acid Rain Risk Score that is displayed on a 162 character LCD. Its all wrapped up in a fun 3D printed enclosure that looks like a cloud.\nThere are some limitations to the device. Namely, it doesnt necessarily have a great read on atmospheric SO2 and NO2 levels in the atmosphere, particularly at altitudes where rain is formed, because the sensor sits inside the device indoors. However, the basic concept is there, and improvements could certainly be made with some upgrades and further research.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u4e88\u6e2c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u3092\u4e88\u6e2c\u3059\u308b Arduino\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u30ac\u30b9\u6fc3\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6539\u5584\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u4e88\u6e2c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u74b0\u5883\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u96f2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u3092\u4e88\u6e2c\u3059\u308b", "- \u9178\u6027\u96e8\u306e\u5371\u967a\u5ea6\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bLCD\u642d\u8f09\u7c21\u6613\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u9178\u6027\u96e8\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

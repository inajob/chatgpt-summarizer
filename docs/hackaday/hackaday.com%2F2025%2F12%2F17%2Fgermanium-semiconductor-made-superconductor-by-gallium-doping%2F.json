MBE is the same process which is used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices such as diodes and MOSFETs and it involves carefully growing crystal lattice in layers atop a substrate.\nWhen the germanium is doped with gallium the crystalline structure, though weakened, is preserved. This allows for the structure to become superconducting when its temperature is reduced to 3.5 Kelvin.\nIt is of course wonderful that our material science capabilities continue to advance, but the breakthrough were really looking forward to is room-temperature superconductors, and were not there yet. If youre interested in progress in superconductors you might like to read about Floquet Majorana Fermions which we covered earlier this year."}

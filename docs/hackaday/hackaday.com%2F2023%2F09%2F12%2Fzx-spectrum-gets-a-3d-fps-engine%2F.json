The ZX Spectrum, on the other hand, is known for text adventures and barebones graphics. However, it now has a rudimentary version of a Quake-like engine, as demonstrated by [Modern ZX-Retro Gaming].\nAs you might expect, the basic ZX Spectrum that sat in front of your dodgy old TV in the 1980s isnt really up to the task of running a full 3D game. The engine runs at a fairly jerky frame rate on a 3.5 MHz ZX Spectrum, with purely monochrome graphics. However, the game can run more smoothly on 7, 14, and 28MHz ZX Spectrum compatibles. As with many such projects, most of the video youll see is of the game running in emulators. Impressively, the game features sound effects, three weapons, and a standard WASD control layout as per modern FPS games.\nIf youre wondering about the confusing visuals, theres a simple explanation. Yes, the UI and weapons are straight out of Doom. However, the game is running on a true 3D engine, with 3D enemies, not sprites. Its inspired by the full 3D engine pioneered by Quake, hence the designation.\nFiles are available for those wishing to try it out at home.\u00a0We do see a fair bit of the ZX Spectrum around these parts. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

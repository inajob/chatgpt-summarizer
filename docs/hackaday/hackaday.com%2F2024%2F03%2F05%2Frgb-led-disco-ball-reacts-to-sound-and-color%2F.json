[Tim van de Vathorst] spent a considerable amount of time reinventing the disco ball into something covered with RGB LEDs that reacts to sound and uses a color sensor to change hue based on whatever its presented with.\n[Tim] started by modeling the disco ball after a soccer ball with a mixture of pentagons and hexagons. Then it was off to the laser cutter to cut it out of 3mm plywood sheets. Once assembled, [Tim] added LED strips across all the faces and wired them up. Then it was time to figure out how to hold the guts together inside of the ball. Back to the drawing board and laser cutter [Tim] went to design a simple two-piece skeleton to hold the Raspberry Pi and the power supply.\nIn order to do some of the really interesting effects, [Tim] had to make sure that the faces were divvied up correctly in code. That was difficult and involved a really big array, but the result looks worth the trouble. Finally, [Tim] covered the ball in white acrylic to diffuse the LEDs. As you will see in the build/demo video after the break, the ball turned out really well. The only real problem is that the camera doesnt work very well without light, which is something good parties are usually short on. [Tim] might add a spotlight or something in the future.\nDo you prefer the mirrored look of the standard disco ball? Peep the tiny one in this Disco Containment Unit.\n\n", "title": "\u97f3\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308bRGB LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306fRGB LED\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u3001\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u8272\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023mm\u306e\u5408\u677f\u3092\u52a0\u5de5\u3057\u3066LED\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3068\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u305f\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u97f3\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308bRGB LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305fRGB LED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3068\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806", "LED\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306eDIY", "\u97f3\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308bLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

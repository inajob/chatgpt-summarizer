But the fact that its the first new coal mine in 50 years isnt the big news  its the mines abundance of rare earth elements thats grabbing the headlines. As weve pointed out before, rare earth elements arent actually all that rare, theyre just widely distributed through the Earths crust, making them difficult to recover. But there are places where the concentration of rare earth metals like neodymium, dysprosium, scandium, and terbium is slightly higher than normal, making recovery a little less of a challenge. The Brook Mine outside of Sheridan, Wyoming is one such place, at least according to a Preliminary Economic Assessment performed by Ramaco Resources, the mining company thats developing the deposit.\nThe PEA states that up to 1,200 tons of rare earth oxides will be produced a year, mainly from the carbonaceous claystones and shales located above and below the coal seams. That sounds like good news to us for a couple of reasons. First, clays and shales are relatively soft rocks, making it less energy- and time-intensive to recover massive amounts of raw material than it would be for harder rock types. But the fact that the rare earth elements arent locked inside the coal is whats really exciting. If the REEs were in the coal itself, that would present something similar to the gasoline problem weve discussed before. Crude oil is a mixture of different hydrocarbons, so if you need one fraction, like diesel, but not another, like gasoline, perhaps because youve switched to electric vehicles, tough luck  the refining process still produces as much gasoline as the crude contains. In this case, it seems like the coal trapped between the REE-bearing layers is the primary economic driver for the mine, but if in the future the coal isnt needed, the REEs could perhaps be harvested and the coal simply left behind to be buried in the ground whence it came.\n\nAnyone old enough to remember the heyday of Heathkit probably can recall the glory that was their annual catalog. Second in importance in the geek calendar year only to the release of the Radio Shack catalog, the Heathkit catalog was highly anticipated for the incredibly diverse line of kits they offered. You could build anything from a simple transistor radio to a full-size color console TV, and everything in between. One thing you couldnt buy from the catalog, though, was a satellite, but thanks to the rebooted Heathkit brand, you sorta-kinda can now. The solar-powered AMSAT CubeSat simulator, which appears to be approximately within the 1U spec, apart from the antennas sprouting from it, is being marketed to the STEM educational market. Thats somewhat belied by the hefty $995 price tag of the kit  for that much, youd think it would be flyable  but the package does include a lot of extra books about CubeSat engineering, as well as some space memorabilia, including space-flown artifacts. So theres that, at least.\nSpeaking of historic artifacts, remember 45 rpm record adapters? If you do, youll no doubt recall the frustrating search for one of these little plastic spiders that youd snap into the big hole in the middle of a 45 record so you could play it on your LP turntable. You might also remember not being able to find one and playing a 45 without the adapter, thereby discovering what the wow in wow and flutter sounded like. Well, thanks to the wonders of the Internet, you never have to worry about not having a 45 adapter on hand, thanks to 45rpmRecordAdapters.com. The site offers all kinds of adapters in all sorts of materials, from the familiar plastic spider-style adapters that stay inside the record hole to the cylindrical or cone-shaped adapters that stay on the turntable. Theyre available in different kinds of plastic as well as aluminum, and while the plastic ones dont appear to be 3D-printed, we can see how you could easily whip up a model for one of these and quickly print it up.\nGood news, everyone  its factory tour time again! This time, were taking a look inside Summit Interconnect, a quick-turn PCB manufacturer in California that specializes in low-volume but quick turnaround prototype work. This is mainly a slide show of the equipment and processes used to turn out quality PCBs fast, although there are a few short videos of the equipment at work. Its a surprisingly hands-on process, with people doing a lot of the transportation of stack-ups between machines. We suppose that makes sense for this scale of work; it would probably be a lot more expensive to build automation that can deal with the variability in stack-ups than it is to pay a human to do it.\nAnd finally, if youve ever wondered what life as a linesman would be like, you need to check out this POV video of a simple pole repair job. Aaron, from the Bobsdecline channel on YouTube, is a journeyman linesman in Canada whos truly passionate about what he does and loves to share it with his audience. For this video, he donned the helmet-mounted GoPro and showed us the replacement of some broken equipment on a service pole, discovered after an unlucky squirrel knocked the power out to a customer. Theres some fantastic footage of the tools and equipment he uses while replacing the cutout, lightning arrestor, and dead-end insulators, but what gets us is how smooth Aarons every move is. Hes obviously done this hundreds of times, resulting in a certain amount of muscle memory, but when dealing with a 7,200-volt primary line, every motion has to be carefully considered. He still manages to make it all look silky smooth even while wearing bulky hot gloves. Face it  most of us would have probably dropped a tool at least once.

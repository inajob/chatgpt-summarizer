That goes double for Sonys MZ-RH1, the last MiniDisk recorder ever released, back in 2006. Its barely larger than the diminutive disks, and its styling is impeccable. Theres a reason theyve become highly collectible and sell for insane sums on e-Bay.\nUnfortunately, they come with a ticking time-bomb of an Achilles heel: the first-generation OLED screens. Failure is not a question of if, but when, and many units have already succumbed. Fortunately enterprising hacker [Sir68k] has come up with replacement screen to keep these two-decade old bits of the future alive.\nReplacement screens glowing brightly, and the custom firmware showing track info, something youd never see on a stock RH1.\nPrevious revisions required some light surgery to get the twin OLED replacement screens to fit, but as of the latest incarnation (revision F+), its now a 100% drop-in replacement for the original Sony part. While it is a drop-in, dont expect it to be easy. The internals are very densely packed, and fairly delicate  both in the name of miniaturization. Youll need to break out the micro-screwdrivers for this one, and maybe some magnifiers if your eyes are as old as ours. At least Sony wasnt gluing cases together back in 2006, and [Sir68k] does provide a very comprehensive repair guide.\nHes even working on new firmware, to make what many considered best MD recorder better than ever. Its not ready yet, but when it is [Sir68k] promises to open-source the upgrade. The replacement screens are sadly not open source hardware, but theyre a fine hack nonetheless.\nWe may see more MiniDisc hacks as the formats apparent revival continues. Things like adding Bluetooth to the famously-cramped internals, or allowing full data transfer  something Sony was unwilling to allow until the RH1, which is one of the reasons these units are so desirable.", "title": "- \u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306eMiniDisc\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01MZ-RH1\u7528OLED\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306eMZ-RH1\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306eOLED\u753b\u9762\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u65b0\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3082\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306eMiniDisc\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01MZ-RH1\u7528OLED\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u540d\u6a5f\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff1aMZ-RH1\u306eOLED\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- MiniDisc\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01MZ-RH1\u306e OLED\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u4ea4\u63db\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u306e\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01MZ-RH1\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u6700\u65b0MiniDisc\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1aBluetooth\u3084\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

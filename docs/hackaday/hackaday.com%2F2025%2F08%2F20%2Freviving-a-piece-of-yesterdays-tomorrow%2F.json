That goes double for Sonys MZ-RH1, the last MiniDisk recorder ever released, back in 2006. Its barely larger than the diminutive disks, and its styling is impeccable. Theres a reason theyve become highly collectible and sell for insane sums on e-Bay.\nUnfortunately, they come with a ticking time-bomb of an Achilles heel: the first-generation OLED screens. Failure is not a question of if, but when, and many units have already succumbed. Fortunately enterprising hacker [Sir68k] has come up with replacement screen to keep these two-decade old bits of the future alive.\nReplacement screens glowing brightly, and the custom firmware showing track info, something youd never see on a stock RH1.\nPrevious revisions required some light surgery to get the twin OLED replacement screens to fit, but as of the latest incarnation (revision F+), its now a 100% drop-in replacement for the original Sony part. While it is a drop-in, dont expect it to be easy. The internals are very densely packed, and fairly delicate  both in the name of miniaturization. Youll need to break out the micro-screwdrivers for this one, and maybe some magnifiers if your eyes are as old as ours. At least Sony wasnt gluing cases together back in 2006, and [Sir68k] does provide a very comprehensive repair guide.\nHes even working on new firmware, to make what many considered best MD recorder better than ever. Its not ready yet, but when it is [Sir68k] promises to open-source the upgrade. The replacement screens are sadly not open source hardware, but theyre a fine hack nonetheless.\nWe may see more MiniDisc hacks as the formats apparent revival continues. Things like adding Bluetooth to the famously-cramped internals, or allowing full data transfer  something Sony was unwilling to allow until the RH1, which is one of the reasons these units are so desirable."}

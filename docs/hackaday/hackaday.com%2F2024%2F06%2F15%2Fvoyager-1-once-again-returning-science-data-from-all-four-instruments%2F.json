Although we know that there will be an end to any science mission, the recent near-death experience by Voyager 1 was a shocking event for many. Now it seems that things may have more or less returned to normal, with all four remaining scientific instruments now back online and returning information.\nSince the completion of Voyager 1s primary mission over 43 years ago, five of its instruments (including the cameras) were disabled to cope with its diminishing power reserves, with two more instruments failing. This left the current magnetometer (MAG), charged particle (LECP) and cosmic ray (CRS) instruments, as well as the plasma wave subsystem (PWS). These are now all back in operation based on the returned science data after the Voyager team confirmed previously that they were receiving engineering data again.\nWith Voyager 1 now mostly back to normal, some housekeeping is necessary: resynchronizing the onboard time, as well as maintenance on the digital tape recorder. This will ensure that this venerable spacecraft will be all ready for its 47th anniversary this fall.\nThanks to [Mark Stevens] for the tip.", "title": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "body": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u304c\u6700\u8fd1\u3001\u4e0d\u8abf\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u307b\u307c\u6b63\u5e38\u306b\u623b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u300247\u5468\u5e74\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3001\u30aa\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306e\u540c\u671f\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u3001\u307b\u307c\u5143\u901a\u308a\u306b\u623b\u308b", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fee\u5fa9\u5b8c\u4e86", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e47\u5468\u5e74\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066\u6e96\u5099", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b"]}

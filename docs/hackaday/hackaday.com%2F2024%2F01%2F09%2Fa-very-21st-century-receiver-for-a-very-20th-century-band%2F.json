It used to be that building an FM broadcast receiver required a bit of RF know-how, but the arrival of all-in-one receiver chips has made that part a simple enough case of including a part. Thats not to say that building a good quality FM broadcast receiver in 2024 doesnt involve some kind of challenge though, and its one that [Stefan Wagner] has risen to admirably with his little unit.\nDoing the RF part is an RDA5807MP single chip radio, but wed say the center of this is the CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller and its software. Twiddling the dial is a thing of the past, with a color display and all the computerized features youd expect. Rounding it off in the 3D printed case is a small speaker and a Li-Po pouch cell with associated circuitry. This really is the equal of any commercially produced portable radio, and better than many.\nEven with the all-in-one chips, theres still fun in experimenting with FM the old way."}

Unfortunately, its not the easiest build to replicate anymore, but [jackw01] was still a fan of the format. Thus was born the Pi Tin\u2014a clamshell handheld for portable fun!\nNeat, huh? More pocket-sized than the Game Boy Pocket.\nThe build is based around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, which packs more power than the original Pi Zero into the same compact form factor. Its combined with a 320 x 240 TFT LCD screen and a 2000 mAh lithium-polymer battery which provides power on the go.\nThere are also a pair of custom PCBs used to lace everything together, including the action buttons, D-pad, and power management hardware. Depending on your tastes, you have two main enclosure options. You can use the neat 3D printed clamshell seen here in beautiful teal, or you can go with the classic Altoids tin build\u2014just be careful when youre cutting it to suit! Files can be found on GitHub for the curious.\nWe love a good handheld project around these parts; its particularly awesome how much gaming you can fit in your pocket given the magic of the Raspberry Pi and modern emulation.

These little modules are a complete video recorder including battery, recording PAL or NTSC composite video and audio to SD card. Theyve become the box of choice for camcorder enthusiasts, but thats not where the fun ends. [Max Vega] has taken a Barbie video camera toy from 2001 and added a MiniDVR to make it into a fully self-contained novelty camcorder. But this isnt a simple case of duct-taping the DVR to the toy, instead its a comprehensive upgrade resulting in a device which could almost have been a real product.\nThe original toy had a small transmitter which could send over a short distance to a receiver that connected to a domestic VCR, so all that circuitry had to go. The camera itself is a small enough module in the fake lens assembly, with an easily identifiable output cable with the required composite signal. The video below the break steps through the proces of making the space for the MiniDVR module, and putting in extensions for all its buttons, and the SD card. Finally it has a new power supply module with an associated USB-C input, providing juice to both DVR and camera.\nThe result has what we can only describe as a pleasingly retro feel, in that its not of high quality and the colour is, well, Never The Same. But when a smartphone can record HD video thats not the point, instead its there to be a retro toy, and in that it succeeds completely.\n\n", "title": "\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30d0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01", "body": "\u6628\u5e74\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aMiniDVR\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u767b\u5834\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u9759\u304b\u306a\u9769\u547d\u304c\u8d77\u3053\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002[Max Vega]\u306f\u30012001\u5e74\u306eBarbie\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306bMiniDVR\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u5df1\u5b8c\u7d50\u578b\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30d0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01", "2001\u5e74\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e0\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b", "\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ab\u30e0\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u308b", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u305f\u3060\u3088\u3046\u30d0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5185\u8535\u3067SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u9332\u753b\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30d0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30ab\u30e0\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9"]}

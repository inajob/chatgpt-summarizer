Most gadgets have made the switch these days, and even Apple has (with some external persuasion) gotten on board. Thats great for new hardware, but it can lead to a frustrating experience when you reach for an older device and find a infuriatingly non-oval connector on the bottom.\nIf one of those devices happens to be Sonys DualShock 4 controller, [DoganM95] has the fix for you. Sony wisely put the controllers original micro USB connector on a separate PCB so it could be cheaply replaced without having to toss the main PCB  that same modularity also means it was relatively easy to develop a USB-C upgrade board.\n\nThat said, there was a bit of a catch. The USB board on the DualShock 4 also carries a LED module that illuminates the Light Bar on the rear of the controller. In this design, [DoganM95] has replaced the original component with a pair of side-firing LEDs. Combined with the extra pins in the flexible printed circuit (FPC) connector necessary to control them, and the pair of 0603 resistors required for USB-C to actually provide power, putting this board together might take a bit more fine-pitch soldering than youd expect.\nOver the last couple of years, weve seen a wide array of devices receive DIY USB-C upgrades. In fact, this isnt even the first time weve seen it done on the DualShock 4. But theres something about hacking a modern port onto a legacy piece of hardware that we just cant seem to get enough of.", "title": "\u30ec\u30ac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "body": "USB-C\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306a\u304f\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u306fUSB-C\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u304c\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306eDualShock 4\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u3067\u3001\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u304f\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30ac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u7169\u308f\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044USB-C\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306b", "DIY\u3067\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080", "\u30ec\u30ac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u898f\u683c\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\uff01\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0"]}

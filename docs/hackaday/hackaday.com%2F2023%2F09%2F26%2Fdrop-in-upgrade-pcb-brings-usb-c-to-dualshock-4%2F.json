Most gadgets have made the switch these days, and even Apple has (with some external persuasion) gotten on board. Thats great for new hardware, but it can lead to a frustrating experience when you reach for an older device and find a infuriatingly non-oval connector on the bottom.\nIf one of those devices happens to be Sonys DualShock 4 controller, [DoganM95] has the fix for you. Sony wisely put the controllers original micro USB connector on a separate PCB so it could be cheaply replaced without having to toss the main PCB  that same modularity also means it was relatively easy to develop a USB-C upgrade board.\n\nThat said, there was a bit of a catch. The USB board on the DualShock 4 also carries a LED module that illuminates the Light Bar on the rear of the controller. In this design, [DoganM95] has replaced the original component with a pair of side-firing LEDs. Combined with the extra pins in the flexible printed circuit (FPC) connector necessary to control them, and the pair of 0603 resistors required for USB-C to actually provide power, putting this board together might take a bit more fine-pitch soldering than youd expect.\nOver the last couple of years, weve seen a wide array of devices receive DIY USB-C upgrades. In fact, this isnt even the first time weve seen it done on the DualShock 4. But theres something about hacking a modern port onto a legacy piece of hardware that we just cant seem to get enough of."}

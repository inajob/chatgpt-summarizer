Thus, he set about a nifty project that would both teach him those lessons and net him something useful in the process. The result was kb1, a mechanical keyboard of his own design!\nYou might think [Thomas] would have started with a basic, barebones design, but he didnt shy away from including some neat features. His keyboard has a tenkeyless layout, and uses Cherry MX-style switches, as has become the norm in the mechanical keyboard world. It has a 162 LCD display for user feedback, a rotary encoder, and it even has an RGB backlight for every key thanks to SK6812 addressable LEDs. Running the show is a Raspberry Pi Pico, equipped with the KMK firmware. The board actually uses twin PCBs as the enclosure, which is a nifty trick.\nIts remarkably fully featured for a first time build.", "title": "Thomas Rinsma\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1akb1", "body": "Thomas Rinsma\u306fPCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5b66\u3073\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9kb1\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u30c6\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3084Cherry MX\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306a\u3069\u591a\u5f69\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002Raspberry Pi Pico\u3068KMK\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3084RGB\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3082\u5b9f\u88c5\u3002", "titles": ["Thomas Rinsma\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1akb1", "PCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5236\u4f5c", "Cherry MX\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u642d\u8f09\uff1akb1\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3068\u9023\u52d5\uff1akb1\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c", "LED\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3068LCD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u642d\u8f09\uff1akb1\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

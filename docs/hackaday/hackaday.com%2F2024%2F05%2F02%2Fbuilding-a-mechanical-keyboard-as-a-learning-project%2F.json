Thus, he set about a nifty project that would both teach him those lessons and net him something useful in the process. The result was kb1, a mechanical keyboard of his own design!\nYou might think [Thomas] would have started with a basic, barebones design, but he didnt shy away from including some neat features. His keyboard has a tenkeyless layout, and uses Cherry MX-style switches, as has become the norm in the mechanical keyboard world. It has a 162 LCD display for user feedback, a rotary encoder, and it even has an RGB backlight for every key thanks to SK6812 addressable LEDs. Running the show is a Raspberry Pi Pico, equipped with the KMK firmware. The board actually uses twin PCBs as the enclosure, which is a nifty trick.\nIts remarkably fully featured for a first time build."}

Theres another more limited emulation scene as similar 8-bit machines emulate each other, for example when the very similar Dragon 32 and Tandy CoCo have a go at each others software. Rarest of them all though is when one classic machine emulates another with a different architecture, but thats exactly whats happened with [DragonBytes], who has persuaded a Tandy CoCo to emulate an Apple II.\nThe two machines have significant hardware differences, but were guessing that the project is helped a little by the Motorola 6809 in the CoCo and the MOS 6502 in the Apple having both in a sense been different visions of a successor to the Motorola 6800. Thus their architectures while different, are not diametrically opposed. The other hardware is certainly not so similar though, with Motos 6847 display chip in the Tandy being far more conventional than Steve Wozniaks clever NTSC hacks to achieve a color display for minimal cost on the Apple.\nThe project is written in assembler, and doesnt by any means claim to support all Apple modes, or be cycle accurate. But its a hugely impressive achievement nevertheless.\nThe CoCo has an enthusiastic following, and has appeared here a few times in the past. We particularly like this video player."}

Of course, there are definite downsides to that, like weight, power consumption, and vibrations. There are solid-state heat pumps  the kind you see in portable coolers, for example. But, they are not terribly efficient and have limited performance.\nHowever, researchers at Johns Hopkins, working with Samsung, have developed a new thin-film thermoelectric heat pump, which they claim is easy to fabricate, scalable, and significantly\u00a0more efficient. You can see a video about the new research below.\nManufacturing requires similar processes to solar cells, and the technology can make tiny heat pumps or  in theory  coolers that could provide air conditioning for large buildings. You can read the full paper in Nature.\nCHESS stands for Controlled Hierarchically Engineered Superlattice Structures. These are nano-engineered thin-film superlattices (around 25\u202f\u03bcm thick). The design optimizes their performance in this application.\nThe new devices claim to be 100% more efficient at room temperature than traditional devices. In practical devices, thermoelectric devices and the systems using them have improved by around 70% to 75%. The material can also harvest power from heat differences, such as body heat. The potential small size of devices made with this technology would make them practical for wearables.\nWeve looked at the traditional modules many times. They sometimes show up in cloud chambers.\n\n"}

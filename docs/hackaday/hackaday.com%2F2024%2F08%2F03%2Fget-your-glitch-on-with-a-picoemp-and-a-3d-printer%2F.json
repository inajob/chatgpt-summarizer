Has a nice ring to it.\nOf course, this isnt a commercial product, or even a rig thats necessarily intended for repeated use. Its more of a tactical build, which is still pretty cool if you ask us. It started with a proof-of-concept exploration, summarized in the first video below. Thats where [Aaron] assembled and tested the major pieces, which included a PicoEMP, the bit that actually generates the high-voltage pulses intended to scramble a running microcontroller temporarily, along with a ChipWhisperer and an oscilloscope.\nThe trouble with the POC setup was that glitching the target chip, an LPC2388 microcontroller, involved manually scanning the business end of the PicoEMP over the package. Thats a tedious and error-prone process, which is perfect for automation. In the second video below, [Aaron] has affixed the PicoEMP to his 3D printer, giving him three-axis control of the tip position. That let him build up a heat map of potential spots to glitch, which eventually led to a successful fault injection attack and a clean firmware dump.\nIts worth noting that the whole reason [Aaron] had to resort to such extreme measures in the first place was the resilience of the target chip against power supply-induced glitching attacks. You might not need to build something like the Glitch-o-Matic, but its good to keep in mind in case you run up against such a hard target.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f[Aaron Christophel]\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u975e\u5546\u7528\u3067\u3001PicoEMP\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u4e00\u6642\u7684\u306a\u4e71\u308c\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3002\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5f37\u56fa\u3055\u306b\u82e6\u3057\u3093\u3060\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "Glitch-o-Matic 9000\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "LPC2388\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u653b\u6483\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7", "PicoEMP\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u653b\u6483\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316", "Glitch-o-Matic: \u56f0\u96e3\u306a\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

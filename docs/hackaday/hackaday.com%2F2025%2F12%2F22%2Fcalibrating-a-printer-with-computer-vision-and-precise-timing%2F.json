In his latest video on the journey, he rigorously calibrated the printer\u2019s motion system, including translation distances, the perpendicularity of the axes, and the bed\u2019s position. The goal was to get better than 100-micrometer precision over a 100 mm range, and reaching this required detours into computer vision, clock synchronization, and linear algebra.\nTo correct for non-perpendicular or distorted axes, [Dennis] calculated a position correction matrix using a camera mounted to the toolhead and a ChArUco board on the print bed. Image recognition software can easily detect the corners of the ChArUco board tiles and identify their positions, and if the camera\u2019s focal length is known, some simple trigonometry gives the camera\u2019s position. By taking pictures at many different points, [Dennis] could calculate a correction matrix which maps the printhead\u2019s reported position to its actual position.\n\nLeveling the bed also took surprisingly deep technical knowledge; [Dennis] was using a PZ probe to detect when the hotend contacted the bed in various places, and had made a wiper to remove interfering plastic from the nozzle, but wasn\u2019t satisfied by the bed\u2019s slight continued motion after making contact (this might have introduced as much as five micrometers of error). To correct for this, he had the microcontroller in the hotend record the time of contact and send this along with the hit signal to the Raspberry Pi controller, which keeps a record of times and positions, letting the true contact position be looked up. This required the hotend\u2019s and the printer\u2019s microcontrollers to have their clocks synchronized to within one microsecond, which the Pi managed using USB start-of-frame packets.\nThe final result was already looking quite professional, and should only get better once [Dennis] calibrates the extrusion settings. If you\u2019re looking for more about ChArUco boards, we\u2019ve covered them before, as well as calibration models. If you\u2019re looking for high-precision bed leveling, you could also check out this Z sensor.\n\nThanks to [marble] for the tip!"}

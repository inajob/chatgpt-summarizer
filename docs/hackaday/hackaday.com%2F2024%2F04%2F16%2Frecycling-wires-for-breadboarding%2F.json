[0033mer] recently shared a tip about how he wires both solderless breadboards and prototype boards on the cheap. Instead of buying special wires, he salvages riser cables often found in scrap from demolished buildings. These often have 200 or so thin solid wires inside. You take them apart, and, as he put it, if you have 15 feet of the stuff, that will last you the rest of your life. We hope you live longer than that, but still.\nOne advantage to doing this is you dont feel bad about cutting the wires exactly to length which makes for neat boards. He has a tiny stripper that make it easy to remove the insulation during installation.\n\nOf course, youve probably been salvaging wires from many sources for years. Still, this is a good reminder that you really dont need to buy that pack of breadboard jumpers from Amazon. Not only will it cost more, the ones with the little tips are not amenable to being cut to size.\nWeve done something similar for years, but we prefer thermal strippers. If you want your entire breadboard from scratch, search through some old magazines.\n"}

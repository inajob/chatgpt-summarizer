While Apple eventually scrapped their licensing plans, an interesting product of the situation was Rhapsody OS. Although Apple was still building PowerPC computers, Rhapsody also had compatibility with Intel processors, which [Omores] put to good use by running it on a relatively modern i7-3770 CPU.\n[Omores] selected a Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3-B3 motherboard because it supports IDE emulation for SATA drives, a protocol which Rhapsody requires. The operating system installer needs to run from two floppy disks, one for boot and one for drivers. The Gigabyte motherboard doesn\u2019t support a floppy disk drive, so [Omores] used an older Asus P5E motherboard with a floppy drive to install Rhapsody onto an SSD, then transferred the SSD to the Gigabyte board. The installation initially had a kernel panic during installation caused by finding too much memory available. Limiting the physical RAM available to the OS by setting the maxmem value solved this issue.\nAfter this, the graphical installation went fairly smoothly. A serial mouse was essential here, since Rhapsody doesn\u2019t support USB. It detected the video card immediately, and eventually worked with one of [Omores]\u2019s ethernet cards. [Omores] also took a brief look at Rhapsody\u2019s interface. By default, there were no graphical programs for web browsing, decompressing files, or installing programs, so some command line work was necessary to install applications. Of course, the highlight of the video was the installation of a Doom port (RhapsoDoom).\nThis isn\u2019t the first obscure Apple operating system we\u2019ve seen; some of them have even involved updates to Apple\u2019s original releases. We\u2019ve also seen people build Apple hardware.\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!"}

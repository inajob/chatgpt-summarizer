Driven initially by the VIC-20, this was the first home computer model to sell over a million units thanks to its low cost and accessibility for people outside of niche markets and hobbyist communities.\nThe VIC-20 would quickly be eclipsed by the much more famous Commodore 64, but for those still using these older machines there are a few tweaks to give it some extra functionality it was never originally designed for like this build which gives it an ISA bus.\nTo begin adapting the VIC-20 to the ISA standard, [Lee] built a fixed interrupt line handled with a simple transistor circuit. From there he started mapping memory and timing signals. The first attempt to find a portion of memory to use failed as it wasnt as unused as he had thought, but eventually he settled on using the I/O area instead although still had to solve some problems with quirky ISA timing. Theres also a programmable logic chip which was needed to generate three additional signals for proper communication.\nAfter solving some other issues around interrupts [Lee] was finally able to get the ISA bus working, specifically so he could add a 3Com networking card and get his VIC-20 on his LAN. Although the ISA bus has since gone out of fashion on modern computers, if you still have a computer with one (or build one onto your VIC-20), it is a surprisingly versatile expansion port.\nThanks to [Stephen] for the tip!", "title": "VIC-20\u3092ISA\u30d0\u30b9\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5  ", "body": "\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u306eVIC-20\u306f\u521d\u306e\u767e\u4e07\u53f0\u8ca9\u58f2\u3092\u9054\u6210\u3002ISA\u30d0\u30b9\u5316\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002", "titles": ["VIC-20\u3092ISA\u30d0\u30b9\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5  ", "Commodore 64\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01VIC-20\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af  ", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u306e\u6539\u9020\uff1aVIC-20\u306b\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0  ", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u56de\u8def\u3067VIC-20\u3092\u9032\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b  ", "\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\uff01ISA\u30d0\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9  "]}

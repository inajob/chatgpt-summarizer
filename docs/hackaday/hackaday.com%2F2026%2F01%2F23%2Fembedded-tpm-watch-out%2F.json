These have become so prevalent that even larger embedded boards now have TPM and, of course, if you are repurposing consumer hardware, youll have to deal with it, too. [Sigma Star] has just the primer for you. It explains what TPM does, how it applies to embedded devices, and where the pitfalls are.\nThe TPM is sometimes a chip or sometimes secure firmware that is difficult to tamper with. They provide secret storage and can store boot signatures to detect if something has changed how a computer starts up. The TPM can also sign off that the system configuration is the same to a remote entity. This allows, for example, a network to prevent a hacked or rogue computer from communicating with other computers.\nEmbedded systems, usually, arent like PCs. A weather station at a remote location may have strangers poking at it without anyone noticing. Also, that remote computer might be expected to be working for many more years than a typical laptop or desktop computer.\nThis leads to a variety of security concerns that TPM 2.0 attempts to mitigate. For example, it is unreasonable to think a typical attacker might connect a logic analyzer to your PC, but for an embedded system, it is easier to imagine. There is a session-based encryption to protect against someone simply snooping traffic off the communication bus. According to the post, not all implementations use this encryption, however.\nMotherboard has a slot for TPM, but no board? Weve seen people build their own TPM boards.\n\nTitle image by [Raimond Spekking] CC BY-SA-4.0", "title": "TPM\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\uff1a\u73fe\u4ee3PC\u3068\u7d44\u8fbc\u307f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "body": "TPM\u306fPC\u3084\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u56f3\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["TPM\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\uff1a\u73fe\u4ee3PC\u3068\u7d44\u8fbc\u307f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u7d44\u8fbc\u307f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bTPM\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u3068\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5bfe\u7b56", "\u81ea\u4f5cTPM\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306a\u3057\u3067\u3082\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd", "TPM 2.0\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5f37\u5316\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bTPM\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u8105\u5a01\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc"]}

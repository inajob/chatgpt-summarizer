The Picopad aims to offer just this, in an open-source hackable format thats friendly to experimenters.\nAs you might have guessed from the name, the Picopad is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico and its RP2040 microcontroller. It features four face buttons and a D-pad, along with a small color LCD with a 320240 resolution. There is also a microSD slot upon which programs can be stored, and also an expansion port with headers for a variety of IO from the RP2040 itself including both GPIOs, serial, I2C and analog input pins. The housing is constructed out of PCBs, with some cheerful gaming artwork adding a fun aesthetic. Development is via a custom C SDK, with support for Micropython as well.\nIf you want to build your own and dont fancy starting from scratch, kits are available online. Weve seen some other great gaming experiments with the Raspberry Pi Pico before, too, like an open-world 3D game and ZX Spectrum emulators. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300cPicopad\u300d: Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "body": "Picopad\u306fRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3067\u3001\u30ab\u30e9\u30fcLCD\u3084\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3001microSD\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u72ec\u81ea\u306eC SDK\u3084Micropython\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3082\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cPicopad\u300d: Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306b\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cPicopad\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306ePicopad\uff1a\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u62e1\u5f35\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u300cPicopad\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u300cPicopad\u300d\u304cDIY\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u767b\u5834"]}

In the game, that is, they dont exist in real life. Which is precisely why [zapwizard] built one!\nExternally, the design faithfully recreates the mid-century design of the Radiation King. Its got the louvered venting on the front panel, the chunky knobs, and a lovely analog needle dial, too. Inside, its got a Raspberry Pi Zero which is charged with running the show and dealing with audio playback. Its paired with a Pi Pico, which handles other interface tasks.\nIt might seem simple, but the details are what really make this thing shine. It doesnt just play music, it runs a series of simulated radio stations which you can tune into using the radio dial. [zapwizard dives into how it all works\u2014from the air core motor behind the simulated tuning dial, to the mixing of music and simulated static. Its really worth digging into if you like building retro-styled equipment that feels more like the real thing.\nIts not just a prop\u2014its a fully-functional item from the Fallout universe, made manifest. You know how much we love those. If youre cooking up your own post-apocalyptic hacks, fictional or non-fictional, dont hesitate to let us know."}

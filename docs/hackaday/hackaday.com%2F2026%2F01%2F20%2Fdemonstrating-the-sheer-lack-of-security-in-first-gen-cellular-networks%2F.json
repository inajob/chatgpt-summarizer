But earlier cellular networks were by no means so secure, as [Nostalgia for Simplicity] demonstrates in a recent video.\nThe video begins with an anecdote  our narrator remembers a family member who could listen in on others conversations on the analog AMPS phone network. This was easily achieved simply by entering a code that would put an Ericsson handset into a test mode, in which it could be switched to tune in any desired AMPS channel. Since the communications were transmitted in a purely analog manner, with no encryption of any sort, any conversation on such a network was basically entirely open for anyone to hear. The video shows a recreation of this method, using a software-defined radio to spin up a low-power, very local AMPS network. A phone call is carried out between two handsets, with a third handset able to listen in just by using the special test mode.\nIf youre particularly keen to build your own first-generation AMPS phone network, just know that its not really allowed due to rules around spectrum allocations. Still, its entirely possible as weve covered before. It doesnt even take much hardware in our modern SDR era.\n\n", "title": "**\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6614\u3068\u4eca**", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306f\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u4f1a\u8a71\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u76d7\u8074\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["**\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6614\u3068\u4eca**", "**\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3067\u4f5c\u308bAMPS\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af**", "**\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027**", "**\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u521d\u4ee3\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af**", "**\u643a\u5e2f\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u5909\u9077**"]}

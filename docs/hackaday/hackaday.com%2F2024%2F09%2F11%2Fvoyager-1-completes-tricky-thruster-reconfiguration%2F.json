As a result, the team has now switched back to the thrusters which they originally retired back in 2018. The Voyager spacecraft each have three sets (branches) of thrusters. Two sets were originally intended for attitude propulsion, and one for trajectory correction maneuvers, but since leaving the Solar System many years ago, Voyager 1s navigational needs have become more basic, allowing all three sets to be used effectively interchangeably.\nThe first set was used until 2002, when clogging of the fuel tubes was detected with silicon dioxide from an aging rubber diaphragm in the fuel tank. The second set of attitude propulsion thrusters was subsequently used until 2018, until clogging caused the team to switch to the third and final set. It is this last set that is now more clogged then the second set, with the fuel tube opening reduced from about 0.25 mm to 0.035 mm. Unlike a few decades ago, the spacecraft is much colder due energy-conserving methods, complicating the switching of thruster sets. Switching on a cold thruster set could damage it, so it had to be warmed up first with its thruster heaters.\nThe conundrum was where to temporarily borrow power from, as turning off one of the science instruments might be enough to not have it come back online. Ultimately a main heater was turned off for an hour, allowing the thruster swap to take place and allowing Voyager 1 to breathe a bit more freely for now.\nCompared to the recent scare involving Voyager 1 where we thought that its computer systems might have died, this matter probably feels more routine to the team in charge, but with a spacecraft thats the furthest removed man-made spacecraft in outer space, nothing is ever truly routine.", "title": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u308b", "body": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u8a70\u307e\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u30012018\u5e74\u306b\u5f15\u9000\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306f\u4eca\u3084\u5168\u90e8\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u4fee\u6b63\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u826f\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u9593\u306b\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u501f\u308a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30921\u6642\u9593\u30aa\u30d5\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u308b", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u822a\u6cd5\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u904b\u7528", "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb"]}

We humbly suggest adding in some type of noise box, especially one like this offering from [Paisley Computer] that uses reverb and other effects to achieve chilling, thrilling sounds.\nAs you can see, this instrument is essentially a bunch of doodads affixed to and through a cigar box. And as youll hear in the first video after the break, the various rubber bands make great drum sounds. The springs are nice, too, but our personal favorite has to be the head massager thing. Shhhing!\nInside the box youll find a guitar jack and some piezos glued to the underside of the top surface, but youll also find springs mounted across the inside that add to the resonance of the cigar box.\nYou can use either an interface and DAW or an effects pedal chain to really make things freaky, and [Paisley Computer] does a showdown between Focusrite interface versus various stomp pedals in the second video. In the third video, we learn how to make one of our own.\nDo you like the idea of a spring reverb? How about a really big one that sounds sort of Satanic?\n\n\n\n"}

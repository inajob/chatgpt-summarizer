While the research is a few years old, user behavior in terms of PIN choice has probably not changed much.\nThe hardware is not much more than a Digispark board, a small ATtiny85-based board with built-in USB connector, and an adapter. In fact, it has a lot in common with the DIY Rubber Ducky except for being focused on doing a single job.\nOnce connected to a mobile device, it performs a form of keystroke injection attack, automatically sending keyboard events to input the most common PINs with a delay between each attempt. Assuming the device accepts, trying all twenty codes takes about six minutes.\nDisabling OTG connections for a device is one way to prevent this kind of attack, and not configuring a common PIN like 1111 or 1234 is even better. You can see the brute forcing in action in the video, embedded below.\n\n\nBruteforcing PIN protection of popular app using $3 ATTINY85 #Arduino\nTesting all possible PIN combinations (10,000) would take less than 1,5 hours without getting account locked. It is possible coz, PIN is limited only to 4 digits, without biometrics authentication#rubberducky pic.twitter.com/rbu9Tk3S9d\n Mobile Hacker (@androidmalware2) July 12, 2023\n"}

[Flasutie] took it a step further by engineering a 3D-printed howitzer that doesnt just sit pretty\u2014it launches shells with a hydrogen-powered bang.\nThis projects secret sauce? Oxyhydrogen, aka HHO, the mix of hydrogen born when water endures the electric breakup of electrolysis.\u00a0[Flasutie] wanted functional high explosive (HE) projectiles to pop without turning playtime into emergency room visit, and 30 mm was the magic size, allowing the thin-walled PLA projectile to rupture without causing injury, even when held in the hand. To set off the gaseous fireworks, [Flasutie] designed an impact fuze featuring piezoelectric spark mechanism nestled within a soft TPU tip for good impact sensitivity.\nThe howitzer itself is like something out of a miniaturized military fantasy\u2014nearly entirely 3D printed. It boasts an interrupted thread breech-locking mechanism and recoil-absorbing mechanism inspired by the real thing. The breechblock isnt just for show; it snaps open under spring power and ejects spent cartridges like hot brass.\nWatch the video after the break for the build, satisfying loading sequence and of course cardboard-defeating armor piercing (AP) and HE shells knocking out targets.\n\n"}

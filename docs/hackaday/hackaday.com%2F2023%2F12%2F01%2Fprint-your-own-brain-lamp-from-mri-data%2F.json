Regardless, theyre a wonderful diagnostic tool and theyve saved thousands if not millions of lives over the years. In a fun use of the technology, [mandalaFractals] has shown us how to make a 3D-printed brain lamp using an MRI scan of the head.\nThe build starts with an off-the-shelf lamp base and a smart LED bulb as the light source, though you could swap those out as desired for something like a microcontroller, a USB power supply, and addressable LEDs if you were so inclined. The software package Slicer is then used to take an MRI brain scan and turn it into something that you can actually 3D print. Itll take some cleaning up to remove artifacts and hollow it out, but its straightforward enough to get a decent brain model out of the data. Alternatively, you can use someone elses if you dont have your own scan. Then, all you have to do is print it in a couple of halves, and pop it on the lamp base, and youre done!\nIts a pretty neat build. Who wouldnt love telling their friends that their new brain lamp was an accurate representation of their own grey noodles, after all? It could be a fun gift next time Halloween rolls around, too!\nMeanwhile, if youve got your own MRI hacks that youve been cooking up, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

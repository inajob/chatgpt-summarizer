One choice is the Owon HDS160, which [Kerry Wong] covers in the video below. The model is very similar to the HDS120, but the multimeter in the HDS160 has more counts60,000 vs 20,000 as you might expect from the model number.\nThe internal chip is an HY3131, which is rated at 50,000 counts which is odd since the meter is 60,000 counts, but presumably the meter uses some capability of the chip, possibly putting it out of spec. The oscilloscope is the same between the two models. Almost everything else works the same, other than the capacitance measuring feature, as the video shows.\nThe difference in cost between the two units isnt much, so if you are shopping, the small extra cost is probably worth it. Not that a 20,000 count meter isnt perfectly fine for most normal uses.\n[Kerry] really likes scopemeters. He gets excited about bench scopes, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Owon HDS160\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u642d\u8f09\u306eHDS160\u3092\u63a8\u5968\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u3084\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Owon HDS160\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 60,000\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\uff01Owon HDS160\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u5185\u8535\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u96fb\u5727\u8a08\u3001Owon HDS160\u3092\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "- Owon HDS120 vs HDS160\uff1a\u9078\u3076\u3079\u304d\u306f\u3069\u3063\u3061\uff1f", "- \u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01Kerry Wong\u306e\u89e3\u8aac"]}

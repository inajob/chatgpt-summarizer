Researchers at McGill University recently figured that the same biological structure could also prove useful in another was\u2014as a fine and precise nozzle for 3D printing (via Toms Hardware).\nSmall prints made with the mosquito proboscis nozzle. Credit: research paper\nTo achieve this feat, the research team harvested the proboscis from a female mosquito, as only the female of the species sucks blood in this timeline. The mosquitos proboscis was chosen over other similar biological structures, like insect stingers and snake fangs. It was prized for its tiny size, with an inside diameter of just 20 micrometers\u2014which outdoes just about any man-made nozzle out there. Its also surprisingly strong, able to resist\u00a0 up to 60 kPa of pressure from the fluid squirted through it.\nOf course, you cant just grab a mosquito and stick it on your 3D printer. It takes very fine work to remove the proboscis and turn it into a functional nozzle; it also requires the use of 3D printed scaffolding to give the structure additional strength. The nozzle is apparently used with bio-inks, rather than molten plastic, and proved capable of printing some basic 3D structures in testing.\nAmusingly, the process has been termed 3D necroprinting, we suspect both because it uses a dead organism and because it sounds cool on the Internet. Weve created a necroprinting tag, just in case, but were not holding our breath for this to become the\u00a0next big thing. At 20 um, more likely the next small thing.\nFurther details are available in the research paper. Weve actually featured quite a few mosquito hacks over the years. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Greg Gavutis for the tip!]", "title": "- \u868a\u306e\u53e3\u543b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "\u868a\u306e\u53e3\u543b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u868a\u306e\u53e3\u543b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- 3D\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u751f\u7269\u7531\u6765\u306e\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u868a\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dc\u30b9\u30ad\u30b9\u304c\u958b\u304f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5370\u5237\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u5fae\u7d30\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3059\u308b\u868a\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30dc\u30b9\u30ad\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u52a0\u5de5\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

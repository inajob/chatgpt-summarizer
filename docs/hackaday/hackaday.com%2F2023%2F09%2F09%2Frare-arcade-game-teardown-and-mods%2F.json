Apparently, there are only a few of these known to exist in 2023, and he managed to find one of them. Well, it is really just a module so he has to figure out how to give it enough input and output to be actually playable. You can see several videos of his work with the Taito game below.\nThe board has a lot of ICs and a Power PC to handle the 3D graphics. The graphics seem clunky today, but they were impressive for the time. According to the video, the CPU board was only used for this game. The ROM that holds the software is separate with a mix of mask-programmed memory and EPROMs.\nThe machine is meant to live in an arcade box. So wiring things like coin selectors, video, speakers, and controllers is a non-trivial exercise. The wiring paid off, though, as the board started up but with no buttons, it wasnt able to start in the first video. The controls go through a 60-pin connector and he tackles that project in part two.\nThe next step is to actually update the game software, which is hard but possible. Of course, you can run many of these old games with MAME or, if you prefer, use it to score that primo engineering workstation you used to covet.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u52aa\u529b", "body": "\u300cVideo Game Esoterica\u300d\u306f1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u3082\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u904a\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u5341\u5206\u306a\u5165\u51fa\u529b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u914d\u7dda\u3082\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u30023D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u306fPower PC\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u5225\u306eROM\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u52aa\u529b", "\u30ec\u30a2\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u914d\u7dda\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u5316", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u300cOperation Tiger\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u66f4\u65b0\u3068MAME\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u6d3b\u7528"]}

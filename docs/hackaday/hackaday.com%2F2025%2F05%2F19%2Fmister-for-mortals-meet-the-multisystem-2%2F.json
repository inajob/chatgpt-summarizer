This review of the Mr. MultiSystem 2 by [Lee] lifts the veil on a surprisingly noob-friendly FPGA console that finally gets the MiSTer experience out of the tinker cave and into the living room. Developed by Heber, the same UK wizards behind the original MultiSystem, this follow-up console dares to blend flexibility with simplicity. No stack required.\nIt comes in two varieties, to be precise: with, or without analog ports. The analog edition features a 10-layer PCB with both HDMI and native RGB out, Meanwell PSU support, internal USB headers, and even space for an OLED or NFC reader. The latter can be used to \u201cload\u201d physical cards cartridge-style, which is just ridiculously charming. Even the 3D-printed enclosure is open-source and customisable  drill it, print it, or just colour it neon green. And for once, you dont need to be a soldering wizard to use the thing. The FPGA is integrated in the mainboard. No RAM modules, no USB hub spaghetti. Just add some ROMs (legally, of course), and youre off.\nDespite its plug-and-play aspirations, there are some quirks  for example, the usual display inconsistencies and that eternal jungle of controller mappings. But hey, if thats the price for versatility, its one youd gladly pay. And if you ever get stuck, the MiSTer crowd will eat your question and spit out 12 solutions. It remains 100% compatible with the MiSTer software, but allows some additional future features, should developers wish to support them.\nWant to learn more? This could be your entrance to the MiSTer scene without having to first earn a masters in embedded systems. Will this become an alternative to the Taki Udon announced Playstation inspired all-in-one FPGA console, which does require a DE-10 (or compatible)?

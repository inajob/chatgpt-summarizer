Did you take enough pictures? Did you remember all the little details that it took to put it together? Should you explain those handful of oddball quirks, even though youre probably the only person in the world that knows how to trigger them?\nWell, we cant speak to how difficult it was for [Mangy_Dog] to put together this training video for his incredible Star Trek: Voyager tricorder replica, but we certainly approve of the final product. Presented with a faux-VHS intro that makes it feel like something that would have been shown to cast members during the legendary run the franchise had in the 1990s, the video covers the use and operation of this phenomenal prop in exquisite detail.\nReplaceable batteries are standard again in the 2370s.\nNow to be fair, [Mangy_Dog] has sold a few of his replicas to other Trek aficionados, and were willing to bet they went for a pretty penny. As such, maybe its not a huge surprise hed need to put together a comprehensive guide on how to operate the devices varied functions. Had this been a personal project there wouldnt have been the need to record such a detailed walk-through of how it all works  so in that regard, were fortunate.\nOne of the most interesting things demonstrated in this video is how well [Mangy_Dog] managed to implement mundane features such as brightness and volume control without compromising the look of the prop itself. Rather than adding some incongruous switches or sliders, holding down various touch-sensitive buttons on the device brings up hidden menus that let you adjust system parameters. The project was impressive enough from the existing images and videos, but seeing just how deep the attention to detail goes is really a treat.\nPreviously we took a look at some of the work that [Mangy_Dog] has put into these gorgeous props, which (unsurprisingly) have taken years to develop. While they might not be able to contact an orbiting starship or diagnose somebodys illness from across the room, its probably fair to say these are the most realistic tricorders ever produced  officially or otherwise.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u64cd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u516c\u958b\uff01", "body": "\u661f\u9593\u822a\u884c\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u671f\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u3001\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u305f\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u5fae\u5999\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3082\u518d\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3053\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306f\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306b\u9ad8\u4fa1\u5024\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u7d30\u90e8\u306b\u307e\u3067\u3053\u3060\u308f\u3063\u3066\u5236\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4f1d\u308f\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u64cd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u516c\u958b\uff01", "\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8a73\u7d30\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u3055\u308a\u6c17\u306a\u304f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u98a8\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u3068\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

The interesting part is how it turns a trigger pull into launching a 6 mm plastic BB. There is a spring, but it only acts as a trigger return and plays no part in launching the projectile. So how does it work?\nTheres a spring in this BB launcher, but its not used like you might expect.\nThe usual way something like this functions is with the trigger pulling back a striker of some kind, and putting it under tension in the process (usually with the help of a spring) then releasing it. As the striker flies forward, it smacks into a BB and launches it. Weve seen print-in-place shooters that work this way, but that is not what is happening here.\nWith [Its on my MIND]s BB launcher, the trigger is a four-bar linkage that transforms a rearward pull of the trigger into a forward push of the striker against a BB that is gravity fed from a hopper. The tension comes from the BBs forward motion being arrested by a physical detente as the striker pushes from behind. Once that tension passes a threshold, the BB pops past the detente and goes flying. Thanks to the mechanical advantage of the four-bar linkage, the trigger finger doesnt need to do much work. The spring? Its just there to reset the trigger by pushing it forward again after firing.\nIts a clever design that doesnt require any additional hardware, and even prints in a single piece. Watch it in action in the video, embedded just below.\n\n"}

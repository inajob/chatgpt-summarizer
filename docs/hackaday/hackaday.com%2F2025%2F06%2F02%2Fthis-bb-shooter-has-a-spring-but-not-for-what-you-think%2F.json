The interesting part is how it turns a trigger pull into launching a 6 mm plastic BB. There is a spring, but it only acts as a trigger return and plays no part in launching the projectile. So how does it work?\nTheres a spring in this BB launcher, but its not used like you might expect.\nThe usual way something like this functions is with the trigger pulling back a striker of some kind, and putting it under tension in the process (usually with the help of a spring) then releasing it. As the striker flies forward, it smacks into a BB and launches it. Weve seen print-in-place shooters that work this way, but that is not what is happening here.\nWith [Its on my MIND]s BB launcher, the trigger is a four-bar linkage that transforms a rearward pull of the trigger into a forward push of the striker against a BB that is gravity fed from a hopper. The tension comes from the BBs forward motion being arrested by a physical detente as the striker pushes from behind. Once that tension passes a threshold, the BB pops past the detente and goes flying. Thanks to the mechanical advantage of the four-bar linkage, the trigger finger doesnt need to do much work. The spring? Its just there to reset the trigger by pushing it forward again after firing.\nIts a clever design that doesnt require any additional hardware, and even prints in a single piece. Watch it in action in the video, embedded just below.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044BB\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044BB\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u8ffd\u52a0\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u6a5f\u69cb\u3067\u4f5c\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u767a\u5c04\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044BB\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "- 4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bBB\u5f3e\u767a\u5c04\u6a5f\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u8ffd\u52a0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u4e0d\u8981\uff011\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u3067\u4f5c\u308bBB\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u5f15\u304f\u3060\u3051\u3067BB\u5f3e\u767a\u5c04\uff01\u753b\u671f\u7684\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u5358\u7d14\u660e\u5feb\uff01\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044BB\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

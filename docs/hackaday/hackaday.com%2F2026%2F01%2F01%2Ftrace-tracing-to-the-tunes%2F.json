Sure, you probably have an ohm meter, but sometimes you dont care about the actual resistance. You just want to know whether something connects or doesnt, especially with a PCB trace or a cable. But what if your beeper could tell you more? [Nick Cornford] asks and answers that question with a beeper that lets you estimate resistance via pitch.\nThe circuit is relatively simple. A short to ground causes a voltage divider to produce a fraction of the battery voltage and a FET to conduct that fractional voltage to a VCO via a high-gain amplifier. The VCO converts voltage to frequency, and an audio amplifier feeds it to the speakers.\nThe two amplifiers and the VCO require two dual op-amp chips. The original schematic sends the output to some relatively high-impedance headphones. To drive more practical ones, the circuit can drop one op amp and use another FET and a separate battery.\nOf course, you have many design choices, especially for the audio amplification. There are plenty of VCO circuits, or you could probably substitute a small microcontroller with an A/D converter and PWM output. Yes, you can also make a VCO with a 555.\nVCOs are common because they are at the heart of PLLs."}

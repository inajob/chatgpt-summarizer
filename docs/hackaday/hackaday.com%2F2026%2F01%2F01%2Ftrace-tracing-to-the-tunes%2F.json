Sure, you probably have an ohm meter, but sometimes you dont care about the actual resistance. You just want to know whether something connects or doesnt, especially with a PCB trace or a cable. But what if your beeper could tell you more? [Nick Cornford] asks and answers that question with a beeper that lets you estimate resistance via pitch.\nThe circuit is relatively simple. A short to ground causes a voltage divider to produce a fraction of the battery voltage and a FET to conduct that fractional voltage to a VCO via a high-gain amplifier. The VCO converts voltage to frequency, and an audio amplifier feeds it to the speakers.\nThe two amplifiers and the VCO require two dual op-amp chips. The original schematic sends the output to some relatively high-impedance headphones. To drive more practical ones, the circuit can drop one op amp and use another FET and a separate battery.\nOf course, you have many design choices, especially for the audio amplification. There are plenty of VCO circuits, or you could probably substitute a small microcontroller with an A/D converter and PWM output. Yes, you can also make a VCO with a 555.\nVCOs are common because they are at the heart of PLLs.", "title": "\u97f3\u3067\u62b5\u6297\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9023\u7d9a\u30d3\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u97f3\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b\u30d3\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u56de\u8def\u8aac\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u97f3\u3067\u62b5\u6297\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9023\u7d9a\u30d3\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308bVCO\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d3\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "FET\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u5897\u5e45\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fVCO\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

Try it out!\nVirtual landers are far cheaper than real ones, thank goodness.\n[Dominic] was inspired in part by this simple rocket landing game which is very much an exercise in reflex and intuition, not to mention being much faster-paced than the classic 1979 video game (which you can also play in your browser here.)\n[Dominic]s version has a similar classic look to the original, but embraces a more thoughtful approach. In it, one uses plain JavaScript to try to minimize the landers angle, velocity, and angular velocity in order to land safely on the generated terrain.\nWant to see if you have the right stuff? Heres a direct link to Lunar Pilot. Dont get discouraged if you dont succeed right away, though. Moon landings have had plenty of failures, and are actually very hard."}

Its just so honest in its directness. AC, though? It can be a little shifty, and that results in some unexpected behaviors, as seen in this video from [The Action Lab].\nHe starts off with a very relatable observation: have you ever noticed that when you plug in a pickle, only half of it lights up? Whats up with that? Well, its related to the asymmetry he sees on his Jacobs ladder that has one side grow hotter than the other. In fact, it goes back to something welders who use DC know about well: the Debye sheath.\nThe arc of a welder, or a Jacobs ladder, or a pickle lamp is a plasma: ions and free electrons. Whichever electrode has negative is going to repel the plasmas electrons, resulting in a sheath of positive charge around it. This positively-charged ions in the Debye sheath are going to accelerate into the anode, and voila! Heating. Thats why it matters which way the current goes when youre welding.\nWith DC, that makes sense. In AC, well  one side starts as negatively charged, and thats all it takes. It heats preferentially by creating a temporary Debye sheath. The hotter electrode is going to preferentially give off electrons compared to its colder twin  which amplifies the effect every time it swings back to negative. It seems like theres no way to get a pure AC waveform across a plasma; theres a positive feedback loop at whatever electrode starts negative that wants to introduce a DC bias. Thats most dramatically demonstrated with a pickle: it lights up on the preferentially heated side, showing the DC bias. Technically, that makes the infamous electric pickle a diode. We suspect the same thing would happen in a hot dog, which gives us the idea for the tastiest bridge rectifier. Nobody tell OSHA.\n[The Action Lab] explains in more detail in his video, and demonstrates with ring-shaped electrode how geometry can introduce its own bias. For those of us who spend most of our time slinging solder in low-voltage DC applications, this sort of thing is fascinating.\u00a0 It might be old hat to others here; if the science of a plain Jacobs ladder no longer excites you, maybe youd find it more electrifying built into a blade.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d4\u30af\u30eb\u30b9\u304c\u534a\u5206\u3057\u304b\u5149\u3089\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1fAC\u3068DC\u306e\u9055\u3044", "body": "AC\u3068DC\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3001AC\u306e\u7279\u6027\u304c\u30d4\u30af\u30eb\u30b9\u306e\u767a\u5149\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d4\u30af\u30eb\u30b9\u304c\u534a\u5206\u3057\u304b\u5149\u3089\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1fAC\u3068DC\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u6eb6\u63a5\u3068\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30b3\u30d6\u30b9\u30fb\u30e9\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u3068\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b7\u30fc\u30b9\uff1a\u96fb\u6d41\u306e\u65b9\u5411\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u73fe\u8c61", "- \u30d4\u30af\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u304c\u793a\u3059AC\u306eDC\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9", "- \u30b8\u30aa\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u6975\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fdc\u7528"]}

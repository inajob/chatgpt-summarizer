Its so tiny!\nEthernet transformers contain tiny coils.\nA joule thief is a sort of minimum-component voltage booster that can suck nearly every last drop of energy from even seemingly-drained batteries, and is probably most famously used to light LEDs from cells that are considered dead.\nMany joule thief designs feature hand-wound coils, which is great for junk box builds but certainly becomes more of a challenge for a tiny build like this one.\nWe really like that [w] salvaged a miniscule coil from an Ethernet transformer, most of which look like blocky SMD components from the outside but actually contain tiny coils.\nThe joule thief has been the basis of plenty of hacks over the years, and its always nice to see new twists on the concept.\n\n\nMiniature 'Joule thief' in a fuse case powered by a 10 year old watch battery  pic.twitter.com/flJHggDRc8\n w (@WFrwrd) August 7, 2024\n"}

Although that one worked, too much chocolate was ultimately lost to the surface of the kitchen table. [Chaz] once again started with a standard chocolate fountain and bought a round wire rack that fits the circumference of the bowl at the bottom. He snipped a hole in the center large enough to accommodate the business part of the fountain and printed a collar with holes that he cleverly zip-tied to the rack.\n[Chaz] also printed a large gear to go around the bowl, a small gear to attach to a six RPM motor, a motor mount for the bowl, and an air blade attachment for a portable Ryobi fan. The air blade worked quite well, doing the double duty of distributing the chocolate and thinning out the coating. Plus, it gives things a neat rumpled look on the top.\nWant to make some special chocolates this year, but dont want to build an enrober? Get yourself a diffraction grating and make some rainbow goodies with melted chocolate.\n\n", "title": "\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u6539\u826f\uff1a\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "body": "Chaz\u306f\u6539\u826f\u3057\u305f\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u5bb6\u65cf\u306e\u4f1d\u7d71\u3092\u7d99\u627f\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u6539\u826f\uff1a\u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u306e\u4f1d\u7d71\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a6\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u5de5\u4f5c", "DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

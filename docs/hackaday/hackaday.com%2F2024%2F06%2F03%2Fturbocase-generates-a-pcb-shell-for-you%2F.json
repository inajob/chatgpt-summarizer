Designing a case for your PCB might feel like a fair bit of effort  but it likely isnt, thanks to projects like turbocase from [Martijn Braam].\nThis script generates simple and elegant OpenSCAD cases for your KiCad PCBs  you only need to draw a few extra lines in the PCB Editor, thats it. It makes connector openings, too  add a Height property to your connector footprints to have them be handled automatically. Oh, and theres a few quality-of-life features  if your project has mounting holes, the script will add threaded-insert-friendly standoffs to the case; yet another argument for adding mounting holes to your boards, in case you needed more.\nInstalling the script is a single line, running it is merely another, and that will cover an overwhelming majority of boards out there; the code is all open too, of course. Want some more customization? Heres some general project enclosure tutorials for OpenSCAD, and a KiCad-friendly StepUp tutorial. Oh, and of course, theres many more ways to enclose PCBs  our own [Bob Baddeley] has written a guide to project enclosures that you are bound to learn new things from.\nWe thank [adistuder] for sharing this with us!", "title": "KiCad PCB\u7528\u306eTurboCase\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "PCB\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u300cturbocase\u300d\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001OpenSCAD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u304cKiCad PCB\u7528\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u958b\u53e3\u90e8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u7a74\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["KiCad PCB\u7528\u306eTurboCase\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u958b\u53e3\u90e8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306aOpenSCAD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8", "PCB\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u7a74\u304c\u3042\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8", "KiCad PCB\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "PCB\u3092\u5305\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

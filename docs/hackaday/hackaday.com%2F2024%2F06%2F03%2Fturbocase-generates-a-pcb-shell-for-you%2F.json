Designing a case for your PCB might feel like a fair bit of effort  but it likely isnt, thanks to projects like turbocase from [Martijn Braam].\nThis script generates simple and elegant OpenSCAD cases for your KiCad PCBs  you only need to draw a few extra lines in the PCB Editor, thats it. It makes connector openings, too  add a Height property to your connector footprints to have them be handled automatically. Oh, and theres a few quality-of-life features  if your project has mounting holes, the script will add threaded-insert-friendly standoffs to the case; yet another argument for adding mounting holes to your boards, in case you needed more.\nInstalling the script is a single line, running it is merely another, and that will cover an overwhelming majority of boards out there; the code is all open too, of course. Want some more customization? Heres some general project enclosure tutorials for OpenSCAD, and a KiCad-friendly StepUp tutorial. Oh, and of course, theres many more ways to enclose PCBs  our own [Bob Baddeley] has written a guide to project enclosures that you are bound to learn new things from.\nWe thank [adistuder] for sharing this with us!"}

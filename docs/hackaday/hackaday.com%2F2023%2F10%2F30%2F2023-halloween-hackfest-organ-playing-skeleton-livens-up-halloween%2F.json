The small animatronic skeleton has canned motions that work very well for mock organ playing while an embedded MP3 player takes care of playing the music.\nThats not to say the project didnt have its challenges. Integrating off-the-shelf components into a project always seems to bring its own little inconveniences. In this case, the skeleton the MP3 player both expect to be triggered with button pushes, but taping the button down wasnt enough to get the skeleton moving when power was applied. [bryan] ended up using relays to simulate button pushes, and a 555 timer circuit to take care of incorporating a suitable delay.\nAs [bryan] puts it, a technical tour de force it aint, but it is practical and it works and it was done on time which is well said. Watch Skelly in action in the video, embedded below. Theres also a second video showing the homebrewed controller and MP3 player, both concealed under Skellys robe.\n\n\n\n \n\n"}

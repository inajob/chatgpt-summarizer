Looking at the back of the beefiest MOSFET in the joint, you\u2019d think about all the current you could pass with it. Or what you\u2019d do with all of those piezo buzzers. And if you didn\u2019t know yet what electronics project you wanted to make, there were things like the Forrest Mims notebooks to inspire you. There you\u2019d find a way to turn the humble LED into a light sensor, whether you needed to or not. I wonder how many packs of assorted LEDs that book sold?!\nDan got his first hands on with a computer in RadioShack as well, because they let folks try them right there. If you didn\u2019t know what you wanted a computer for, and that was the big question of the early microcomputer era, you could head into the store yourself and find out. Seeing, and playing with, Demon Dancer inspired.\nA lot of this role is taken over by hackerspaces these days, and even more is taken by the Internet itself, of course. We have no shortage of inspiration \u2013 just read a day\u2019s worth of Hackaday if you don\u2019t believe me. So is there any room left for RadioShack\u2019s inspirational role? Maybe not. But if that\u2019s the cost of living in a world where we have access to more great ideas than we\u2019ll ever have time to execute, then so be it!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

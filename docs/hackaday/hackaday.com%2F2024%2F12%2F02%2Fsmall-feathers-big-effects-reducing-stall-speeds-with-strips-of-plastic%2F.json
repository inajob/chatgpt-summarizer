These small feathers on top of birds wings lay flat during normal flight but flare up in turbulence during landing. By attaching flexible plastic strips  covert flaps  to the top of a wing, the team has demonstrated impressive gains in aircraft performance at low speeds.\nWind tunnel tests and RC aircraft trials revealed a fascinating two-part mechanism. The front flaps interact with the turbulent shear layer, keeping it close to the wing surface, while the rear flap create a pressure dam that prevents high-pressure air from moving forward. The result? Up to 15% increase in lift and 13% reduction in drag at low speeds. Unfortunately the main body of the paper is behind a paywall, but video and abstract is still fascinating.\nThis innovation could be particularly valuable during takeoff and landing  phases where even a brief stall could spell disaster. The concept shares similarities with leading-edge slats found on STOL aircraft and fighter jets, which help maintain control at high angles of attack. Imitating feathers on aircraft wings can have some interesting applications, like improving control redundancy and efficiency.\n\n"}

It takes a little extra work compared to just pointing a camera at the build plate, but its worth it to see your prints materialize like magic.\nUsually these are done with a plugin for OctoPrint, but with all due respect to that phenomenal project, its a lot to get set up if you just want to take some pretty pictures. Which is why [Whopper Printing] put together the LayerLapse. This small PCB is designed to trigger your DSLR or mirrorless camera once its remotely-mounted hall effect sensor detects the presence of a magnet.\nThe remote hall effect sensor.\nThe idea is that you just need to stick a small magnet to your extruder, add a bit of extra G-code that will park it over the sensor at the end of each layer, and youre good to go. Theres even a spare GPIO pin broken out should you want to trigger something else on each layer of your print. Admittedly we cant think of anything else right now that would make sense, other than some other type of camera, but were sure some creative folks out there could put this feature to use.\nCurrently, [Whopper Printing] is selling the LayerLapse as a finished product, though it does sound like a kit version is in the works. Theres also instructions for building a DIY version of the hardware using your microcontroller of choice. Whether you buy or build the hardware, the firmware is available under the MIT license for your tinkering pleasure.\nBeing hardware hackers, we appreciate the stand-alone nature of this solution. But if youre already controlling your printer through OctoPrint, youre probably better off just setting up one of the available time-lapse plugins.", "title": "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308bLayerLapse", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u64ae\u5f71\u7528\u300cLayerLapse\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\u78c1\u77f3\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3057\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7c21\u5358\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308bLayerLapse", "- \u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\uff01LayerLapse\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLayerLapse\uff1aDIY\u6d3e\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- OctoPrint\u306a\u3057\u3067\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1aLayerLapse\u306e\u8ca9\u58f2\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

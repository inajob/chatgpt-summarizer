Contrails are an instant visual reminder of air travel, and a source of much controversy in recent decades. Put aside the overblown conspiracies, though, and there are some genuine scientific concerns to explore.\nSee, those white streaks planes leave in the sky arent just eye-catching. It seems they may also be having a notable impact on our climate. Recent research shows their warming effect is comparable to the impact of aviations CO2 emissions. The question is then simple\u2014how do we stop these icy lines from heating our precious Earth?\n\nBut How?\nA Qantas airliner releases contrails at 36,000 feet. Note the contrails form some way behind the outlet of the engines\u2014the water vapor in the hot exhaust takes time to cool and form ice crystals around tiny particles that act as nucleation points. Sergey Kustov, CC BY-SA 3.0\nThe name contrails is a portmanteau of condensation trails, which tells you everything you need to know. Those white streaks form when aircraft fly through cold, humid areas of the atmosphere. They come about when water vapor mixes with tiny particles of soot and sulfur in the aircrafts exhaust, which act as nucleation points for forming water droplets. These then tend to freeze in low temperature conditions, creating icy particles behind the aircraft.\u00a0 The result? The telltale trail in the sky.\nDue to the chemical vagaries of combustion, aircraft exhaust pretty much contains all the ingredients for contrail production\u2014primarily water vapor and tiny particulates. However, those alone arent enough to produce a bright and lingering contrail. Some contrails may only last a few seconds, or maybe a few minutes, in moderately cool zones of the atmosphere. However, in places where it gets particularly cold and humid, its possible for an aircraft to leave contrails that last for hours, slowly spreading out until they become many kilometers wide. Under these conditions, they functionally increase the level of cloud cover in the atmosphere.\nThe Problem\nUnfortunately,\u00a0 contrails arent just pretty lines in the sky. Scientists have found they also have an impact on the climate\u2014and not in the direction wed like. Unfortunately, contrails tend to have a warming effect. While they increase the amount of sunlight reflected away from Earth, they ultimate trap more heat in the atmosphere than they bounce away.\nThe sky above W\u00fcrzburg, Germany\u2014left, with no flights, and right, with regular air traffic. What looks like natural cloud cover is in fact the result of long-lived contrails spreading out over time.

One study performed in 2018 suggested that contrails are doing more to heat up the Earth than all the CO2\u00a0emitted by aviation since 1940. The science is clear  these artificial clouds are a serious climate concern.\nThere is hope for tackling this icy problem, however. As most of us have noticed, not every plane leaves a bright, long lasting contrail. Thats because atmospheric conditions have to be within a certain range to produce them. Fly in warmer, less humid air, and your contrails wont last as long\u2014nor do as much harm to the climate.\nAs it turns out, less than 3% of global flights generate 80% of contrail warming. The effect is particularly pronounced in regions like North America, Europe, and the North Atlantic, where high-altitude flights are common. Night flights also cause the most warming, because the clouds are just trapping heat. Daytime flights create less damaging contrails because they reflect some sunlight to offset the heat theyre trapping on Earth.\nThe good news is that relatively simple solutions exist. By making minor adjustments to flight paths  climbing or descending slightly to avoid the cold, humid atmospheric layers where contrails form  airlines can significantly reduce their climate impact. In a 2023 trial, tests by American Airlines and Google showed that it was possible to cut contrail formation by 54% with only a 2% increase in fuel use. With only some flights having to adjust their routes to reduce contrails, the effect could be as little as an 0.3% increase in fuel burn across an airlines fleet. In fact, one study suggests that the benefits of producing less contrails would be 100 times greater than the penalty of added greenhouse gas emissions from the greater fuel burn. Cost-wise, estimates suggest avoiding contrails would add just \u20ac3.90 to a Paris-New York ticket or \u20ac1.20 to a Barcelona-Berlin flight.\nRecent studies suggest just 3% of flights cause 80% of contrail warming. A handful of flights actually create contrails with a cooling effect, but theyre the minority. Credit: study paper, data from Teoh, et al (2024)\nThe aviation industry now faces a clear opportunity: by targeting the small number of flights causing most contrail warming, they could make a major dent in their climate impact at minimal cost. With appropriate weather forecasting and flight planning, contrail avoidance could be one of aviations most cost-effective climate solutions.\nIts not an instant solution\u2014there is still a great deal of work to be done before this is a routine practice in the industry. Ultimately, more fuel burn will still cost airlines money, as will the administrative overhead of predicting pro-contrail conditions and tasking aircraft to avoid them. Regardless, addressing contrails offers a smart, immediate way to reduce aviations contribution to global warming. The science is solid, the solutions are available, and the costs are theoretically manageable. The next step is putting this knowledge into action\u2014the question remains as to which airlines lead the charge.", "title": "\u300c\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u822a\u8de1\u304c\u6c17\u5019\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "body": "\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e\u822a\u8de1\u306f\u6c17\u5019\u6e29\u6696\u5316\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6539\u5584\u7b56\u3082\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u822a\u8de1\u304c\u6c17\u5019\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u6e29\u6696\u5316\u306e\u539f\u56e0\uff1f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u767d\u3044\u7dda\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u300d", "\u300c\u822a\u7a7a\u696d\u754c\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u822a\u8de1\u524a\u6e1b\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30b3\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u304c\u793a\u3059\u8b66\u544a\u300d", "\u300c\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u6e29\u6696\u5316\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01\u300d"]}

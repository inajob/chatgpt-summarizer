The unseeable in question is differences in air density or, more precisely, differences in the refractive index of the fluid the imaging set up makes use of, in this case air. Think of how you can see waves of heat on a warm day thats lower-density hot air refracting light as it rises. Schlieren photography weaponizes this, allowing to analyze fluid flows for example, the mach cones in a DIY rocket nozzle, which is what got [Ayden Wardell Aerospace] interested in the technique.\nExamining exhaust makes this a useful tool for [Aerospace].This is a classic mirror-and-lamp Schlieren set up.\u00a0 You put the system you wish to film near the focal plane of a spherical mirror, and camera and light source out at twice the focal distance. Rays deflected by changes in refractive index miss the camera usually one places a razor blade precisely to block them, but [Ayden] found that when using a smart phone that was unnecessary, which shocked this author.\nWhile it is possible that [Ayden Wardell Aerospace] has technically constructed a shadowgraph, they claim that carefully positioning the smartphone allows the sharp edge of the case to replace the razor blade. A shadowgraph, which shows the second derivative of density, is a perfectly valid technique for flow visualization, and is superior to Schlieren photography in some circumstances when looking at shock waves, for example.\nRegardless, the great thing about this project is that [Ayden Wardell Aerospace] provides us with STLs for the mirror and smartphone mounting, as well as providing a BOM and a clear instructional video. Rather than arguing in the comments if this is truly Schlieren imaging, grab a mirror, extrude some filament, and test it for yourself!\nThere are many ways to do Schlieren images. Weve highighted background-oriented techniques, and seen how to do it with a moir\u00e9 pattern, or even a selfie stick. Still, this is the first time 3D printing has gotten involved and the build video below is quick and worth watching for those sweet, sweet Schlieren images.\n"}

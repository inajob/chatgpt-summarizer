The guys from the YouTube channel\u00a0How To Make Everything have been looking at one such sketch, a screw thread-cutting machine. At first glance, it seems a little flawed. Threads are hard to make by hand, and you can see that this thread-cutting machine needs two identical threads operating as a reference to make it work. However, as the guys demonstrate, you\u00a0can create threads by hand using simple methods.\nStarting with an offset blade mounted on a block with a hole through it, a dowel can be scribed with a starter thread. This can then be worked by hand to cut enough of a groove for the application. They demonstrated that the machine was viable using nothing but wood for construction. A metal blade was mounted, and some preload force was applied to it with a spring. The dowel to be cut was loaded, and the machine ran back and forth enough times to create a very nice-looking screw thread. And once youve made two identical threaded dowels, you can use them to upgrade the machine or even build a second. Once you have a repeatable way to make such threads, all kinds of applications become more accessible. Need a bench vice? No problem now!\nWhilst the demonstration doesnt precisely follow the plans laid out by the master inventor, they arent all that clear on the cutting tool after all, its nice to see people still wanting to build his ideas, and well certainly be following along.\nIf you like these from scratch builds, youll like this other one. Leonardos work wasnt just about machines; he was also very interested in science. Heres a recreation of his demonstration of gravity as a form of acceleration.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith] for the tip!", "title": "\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "body": "\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u300c\u306d\u3058\u5207\u308a\u6a5f\u300d\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210\u30012\u3064\u306e\u540c\u4e00\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u7dda\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u3088\u3044\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u793a\u3057\u3001\u518d\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3082\u4f5c\u6210\u3002DaVinci\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u8208\u5473\u3082\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "YouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u6311\u6226\u3001\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3001\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u5143\u306b\u3001\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3001\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

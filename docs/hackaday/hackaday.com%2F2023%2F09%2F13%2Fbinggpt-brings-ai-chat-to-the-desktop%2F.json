Miss clicking on a good old desktop icon to open a local bit of software? In that case, BingGPT could be just the thing for you.\nIts nothing too crazy\u2014just a desktop application that gives you access to Bings AI-powered chatbot. Its available on a range of platforms, from Windows, to Apple, and Linux, and binaries are available for Intel, Apple Silicon, and ARM processors.\nUsing BingGPT is simple. Sign in with your Microsoft account, and away you go. Theres no need to use Microsoft Edge or any ugly browser plugins, and you can export your conversations to Markdown, PNG, and PDF for sharing beyond the program. Its also complete with a range of keyboard shortcuts to speed your interaction with the large language model when it gets off track. Theres also the Compose button which can actually go ahead and write stuff for you.\nFundamentally, all the cool stuff is still coming in via the web, but its nice to be able to use Bings chatbot without having to succumb to the horrors of a Microsoft browser. Its interesting to see how large language models are becoming an all-pervasive tool of late. If youre building your own nifty projects in this area, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

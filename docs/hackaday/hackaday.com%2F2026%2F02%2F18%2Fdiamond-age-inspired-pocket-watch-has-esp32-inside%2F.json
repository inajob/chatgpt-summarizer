When that inspiration is taken from the boob tube or the silver screen, the visual design is largely taken care of by the prop department. If, on the other hand, one seeks inspiration from the written word like [Math Campbell] did for his smart pocket watch inspired by The Diamond Age the visuals are much more up to the individual hacker. Though no nanotechnology was involved in its creation, we think [Math] nailed the Victorian High-Tech vibe of [Neil Stephenson]s cult classic.\nThe build itself is fairly simple: [Math] started with a Waveshare dev board that got him the 1.75 round touch display, along with an ESP32-S3 and niceties such as a six-axis IMU, an RTC, microphone, speaker, and micro SD card reader. Thats quite the pocket watch! The current firmware, which is available on GitHub, focuses on the obvious use case of a very stylish watch, as well as weather and tidal display. Aside from the dev board, [Math] needed only to supply a battery and a case.\n[Math] designed the case for the watch himself in Fusion360 before sending it off to be 3D printed in stainless steel. That might not be molecular-scale manufacturing like in the book, but its still amazing you can just do that. Ironically, [Math] is a silversmith and will be recreating the final version of the watch case in sterling silver by hand. Wed be tempted to include a doormaking it a hunters case in pocket watch lingoto protect that amoled display, but far be it for us to tell an artist how to do his work. If youre not a silversmith, [Math] has stated his intent to add STLs to the GitHub repo, though they arent yet present at time of writing.\nWeve featured smart pocket watches before, some with more modern aesthetics. Of course a watch doesnt have to be smart to grace these pages.\nThanks to [Math Campbell] for the tip! If youve got time on your hands after ticking done on a project, send us a tip and watch for it to appear here."}

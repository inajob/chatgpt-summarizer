That made it possible to sense the acceleration and position of a platform with a single wheel, and to control that single wheel to keep the platform stable and level, even in motion. [RCLifeOn] has now taken that same concept and made it more hilarious by swapping out the wheel for a track.\nThe original idea was to build an electric snowboard, which worked just okay. Then, it morphed into a tank-based one-wheel instead. Its a bit silly on the face of it, because a track is more stable than a wheel. Thats because instead of balancing on a small flattened spot of a tire, its got a wider, flatter footprint. But that means theres no real need for balancing control as the track is statically stable.\nThe 3D-printed track assembly is driven by a powerful brushless motor via a gear drive for additional torque. Riding it is difficult on 48-volt power as it easily throws [RCLifeOn] off the board with its raw torque. At 24 volts, however, it was just barely ridable with some practice. But it was ultimately pretty terrible. It was either not moving at all, or jerking so hard that it was impossible to stay on the thing.\nWed like to see this concept tried again, perhaps with a rubber track and a more refined controller. Video after the break.\n\n"}

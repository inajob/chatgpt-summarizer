The propaganda we were fed as kids matched theirs in describing the awful things on the other side of the wall, something that wasnt borne out when a decade or so later in the 1990s we met people from the former communist side and found them unsurprisingly to be just like us. Its thus still of interest to have a little peek into Eastern Bloc consumer electronics, something we have the chance of courtesy of [DiodeGoneWild], whos fixing a 1980s Soviet cassette recorder.\nThe model in question is a Vesna 309, and it has some audio issues and doesnt turn the tape. It gets a teardown, the motor is cleaned up inside, and a few capacitor and pot cleanups later its working again. But the interest lies as much in the machine itself as it does in the repair, as its instructive to compare with a Western machine of the same period.\nWere told it would have been an extremely expensive purchase for a Soviet citizen, and in some ways such as the adjustable level control its better-specified than many of our equivalents. Its based upon up-to-date components for its era, but the surprise comes in how comparatively well engineered it is. A Western cassette deck mechanism would have been a much more sketchy affair than the substantial Soviet one, and its motor would have been a DC part with a simple analogue speed controller rather than the brushless 3-phase unit in the Vesna. Either were looking at the cassette deck for senior comrades only, or the propaganda was wrong  at least about their cassette decks. The full video is below, and if youre hungry for more its not the first time weve peered into electronics from the eastern side of the Iron Curtain.\n\n"}

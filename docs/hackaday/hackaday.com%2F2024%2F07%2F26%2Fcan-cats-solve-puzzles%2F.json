[Makers Muse] has a pair of half-grown-up kittens, and set out to provide them with a plaything far better than those the market could offer. The result is the Snak Attak, a gravity puzzle maze that delivers kibble for the cat prepared to puzzle it out.\nThe point of this exercise isnt to give kibble but to provide the optimum play experience for a pair of younger cats. The premise is that kibble is held back by a set of wooden pegs each with a temptingly dangly string, and they should after some investigation be able to pull the pegs out and release it. Whats interesting is how the two different cats approach the problem, while one pulls the out as expected, the other pushes them from the back of the device.\nThe conclusion is that the two cats can indeed solve puzzles, and gain hours of play from the device. An updated version was produced with a few more challenges, and as you can see in the video below the break, its captivated their attention. Its not the first cat toy weve brought you by any means, this robotic mouse springs to mind, but its certainly upped the ante on feline entertainment.\n\n"}

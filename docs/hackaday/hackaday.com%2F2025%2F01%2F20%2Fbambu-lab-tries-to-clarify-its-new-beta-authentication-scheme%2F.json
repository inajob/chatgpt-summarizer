After announcing a new authentication scheme for cloud  LAN-based operations a few days ago, Bambu Lab today posted an update thats supposed to address said criticism and feedback. This follows the original announcement which had the 3D printer community up in arms, and quickly saw the new tool thats supposed to provide safe and secure communications with Bambu Lab printers ripped apart to extract the security certificate and private key.\nIn the new blog post, the Bambu Lab spokesperson takes a few paragraphs to get to the points which the community are most concerned about, which is interoperability between tools like OrcaSlicer and Bambu Lab printers. The above graphic is what they envision it will look like, with purportedly OrcaSlicer getting a network plugin that should provide direct access, but so far the Bambu Connect app remains required. Its also noted that this new firmware is just Beta firmware.\nAs the flaming wreck thats Bambu Labs PR efforts keeps hurtling down the highway of public opinion, wed be remiss to not point out that with the security certificate and private key being easily obtainable from the Bambu Connect Electron app, there is absolutely no point to any of what Bambu Lab is doing."}

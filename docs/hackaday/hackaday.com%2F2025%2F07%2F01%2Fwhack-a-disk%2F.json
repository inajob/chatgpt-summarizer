In fact, theyre so rare to see in the world anymore that many below a certain age dont recognize the save symbol commonly used in application user interfaces. Without a use case, and with plenty of old floppies still laying around, [Rob] took a pile of them and built this Whack-a-Mole-style game.\nThe game has a number of floppy-disk-specific features compared to the arcade classic, though. First, theres no mallet, so the player must push the floppy disks into the drive manually. Second, [Rob] went to somewhat exceptional lengths to customize the drives to that sometimes the disks jump out of the drive, forcing the player to grab them and put them back in to score points in the game. He did this without needing to install high-powered solenoids in the drives too. As for the game software itself, it all runs on an Amiga 600 and even includes a custom-made soundtrack for the 30-second game.\nGetting the drives just right did take a number of prototypes, but after a few versions [Rob] has a working game that looks fun to play and is a clever use of aging hardware, not to mention the fact that it runs on a retro computer as well. Of course, for the true retro feel, youll want to make sure you find a CRT for the display somewhere, even though theyre getting harder to find now than old floppy disk drives.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u30ef\u30af\u30ef\u30af\u306e\u30ef\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "body": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a6\u30a3ack-a-Mole\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u306f\u72ec\u7279\u3067\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u30ef\u30af\u30ef\u30af\u306e\u30ef\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac600\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff1a\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u904a\u3073\u65b9", "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u5ec3\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3055\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

The technology was new, and quite a bit less secure back then\u2014particularly if not configured properly. That gave rise to the practice of wardriving\u2014driving around with a computer, looking for unsecured networks, often just for the fun of it. [Simon] has been examining this classic practice from a modern perspective.\u00a0\nHes been at the game for a long time\u2014from back in the days when you might head out with a thick old laptop, a bunch of PCMCIA cards, and dangly antennas. Its much more advanced these days, given weve got WiFi on all different bands and Bluetooth devices to consider to boot. Heck, even Zigbee, if youre hunting down a rogue house full of Internet of Things gadgets.\nToday, when hes out researching the wireless landscape, he uses devices like the Flipper Zero, the Raspberry Pi, and a Google Pixel 5 running the WiGLE WiFi Wardriving app. [Simon] notes that the latter is the easiest way to get started if youve got an Android phone. Beyond that, theres software and hardware out there these days that can do amazing things compared to the simple rigs of yesteryear.\nIf youre out looking for free internet these days, wardriving might be a bit pointless given its available in practically every public building you visit. But if youre a wireless security researcher, or just curious about what your own home setup is putting out, it might be worth looking at these tools! Happy hunting."}

[Brian Minnick]\u2019s fully-printed 3D printer could eventually change that, and he\u2019s already solved an impressive number of technical challenges in the process.[Brian]\u2019s first step was to make a 3D-printable motor. Instead of the more conventional stepper motors, he designed a fully 3D-printed 3-pole brushed motor. The motor coils are made from solder paste, which the printer applies using a custom syringe-based extruder. The paste is then sintered at a moderate temperature, resulting in traces with a resistivity as low as 0.001 \u2126 mm, low enough to make effective magnetic coils.\nBrushed motors are less accurate than stepper motors, but they do have a particularly useful advantage here: their speed can be controlled simply by varying the voltage. This enables a purely electromechanical control system \u2013 no microcontroller on this printer! A 3D-printed data strip encodes instructions for the printer as holes in a plastic sheet, which open and close simple switches in the motor controller. These switches control the speed, direction, and duration of the motors\u2019 movement, letting the data strip encode motion vectors.Remarkably, the hotend on this printer is also 3D-printed. [Brian] took advantage of the fact that PEEK\u2019s melting point increases by about 110 \u2103 when it\u2019s annealed, which should allow an annealed hotend to print itself. So far it\u2019s only extruded PLA, but the idea seems sound. The video below the break shows a single-axis proof of concept in action. We haven\u2019t been able to find any documentation of a fully-functional 3D printer, but nevertheless, it\u2019s an impressive demonstration. Weve covered similar printers before, and if you make progress in this area, be sure to send us a tip.\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u578b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u5370\u5237\u3055\u308c\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3067\u3001\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30823D\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5df1\u8907\u88fd\u578b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30df\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u6c0f\u306e\u5168\u81ea\u52d53D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u6c17\u6a5f\u68b0\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u81ea\u5df1\u88fd\u9020\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u6307\u793a\u4f1d\u9054"]}

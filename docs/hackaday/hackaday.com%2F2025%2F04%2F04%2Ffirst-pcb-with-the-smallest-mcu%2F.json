He has already designed, fabbed, populated, and tested a breakout board for the new tiniest microcontroller on the market, and he\u2019s even made a video about it, embedded below.\nYou might have heard about this new TI ARM Cortex MO micro on these very pages, where we asked you what you\u2019d do with this grain-of-rice-sized chunk of thinking sand. (The number one answer was \u201csneeze and lose it in the carpet\u201d.)\nFrom the video, it looks like [Morten] would design a breakout board using Kicad 8, populate it, get it blinking, and then use its I2C lines to make a simple digital thermometer demo. In the video, he shows how he worked with the part, from making a custom footprint to spending quite a while nudging it into place before soldering it carefully down.\nBut he nailed it on the first try, and honestly it doesn\u2019t look nearly as intimidating as we\u2019d feared, mostly because of the two-row layout of the balls. It actually looks easy enough to fan out. Because you can\u2019t inspect the soldering work underneath the chip, he broke out all of the lines to a header to make it quick to check for shorts between those tiny little balls. Smart.\nWe love to see people trying out the newest hotness. Let us know down in the comments what new parts you\u2019re trying out.\nThanks [Clint] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "- \u6700\u65b0\u306e\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "Morten\u304c\u65b0\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u7528\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u304f\u7c21\u5358\u305d\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6700\u65b0\u306e\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- Kicad 8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6e29\u5ea6\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- Morten\u6c0f\u306e\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3068\u306f", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

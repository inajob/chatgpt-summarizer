Sometimes, you just have to grit your teeth and push through. But small tweaks can make the onerous task a bit easier to handle. [James Bowman] sent in his latest quick project that helps him fold small boxes more efficiently.\nTo fulfill orders on his previously covered TermDriver2, [James Bowman] is faced with folding thousands of small boxes. To aid in this daunting task, he had the idea of making a tool to streamline the process \u2014 every second saved adds up when you\u2019re repeating a task thousands of times. He designed a 3D printed mandrel that pops the flat box blank open as it\u2019s slid over the tapered top, shaping it into a perfect rectangle for easy folding of the top flaps.\nThe nice thing about 3D printng is how easy it is to iterate on a design. Once James had the first version printed and verified it worked as hoped, he had ideas to improve it, such as adding a second mandrel to twist the box from both the inside and outside and adding a guide on one side to enhance rigidity.\nWhile we often think of 3D printers producing ready-to-use parts, but printed tooling holds great potential for repetitive tasks, and is a huge cost saver compared to traditional methods.", "title": "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u884c\u3046\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "titles": ["- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5909\u3048\u308b\u53cd\u5fa9\u4f5c\u696d\u306e\u52b9\u7387", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7bb1\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30ec\u30eb\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u5370\u5237\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

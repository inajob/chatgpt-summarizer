Youre interested as to where it might be coming from. Youre receiving it well, and the signal strength is strong, but is that because its close or just particularly powerful? What could it be? How would you even go about tracking it down?\nWhen it comes to hunting down radio transmissions, Justin McAllister and Nick Foster have a great deal of experience in this regard. They came down to the 2024 Hackaday Superconference to show us how its done.\n\nTransmissions From Where?\n\nNick Foster opens the talk by discussing how the first job is often to figure out what youre seeing when you pick up a radio transmission.\u00a0 The moral of this talk is that your hardware is always lying to you, says Nick. In this talk, were going to show you how your radio lies to you, what you can do about it, and if your hardware is not lying to you, what is that real station that youre looking at? It can be difficult to tease out the truth of what the radio might seem to be picking up. How do we determine what a signal actually is? he asks. Is it a real signal that were looking at which is being transmitted deliberately from somebody else, or is it interference from a bad power supply, or is it a birdie\u2014a signal thats created entirely within my own radio that doesnt exist at all?\nThere are common tools used to perform this work of identifying just what the radio is actually picking up and where its coming from. Justin goes over some of the typical hardware, noting that the RX-888 is a popular choice for software-defined radio that can be tuned across HF, VHF, and UHF bands. Its highly flexible, and its affordable to boot, as is the Web-888 which can be accessed conveniently over a web browser. Other common SDRs are useful, too, as are a variety of filters that can aid with more precise investigations.\nJustin demonstrates an errant radio emission from the brushed motor in his furnace, noting how it varies in bandwidth\u2014a surefire tell versus intentional radio transmissions.\nEstablishing a grounding in reality is key, Justin steps up to explain. We turn our SDR on, we stick [on] the little antenna that comes with it, and we start looking at something, says Justin. Are the signals that we see there actually real? He notes that there are some basics to consider right off the bat. One key point to make is that nobody makes money or has good communication using an unmodulated carrier, he points out. If you just see a tone somewhere, it might be real, but theres a good chance that its not.\nIts perhaps more likely unintentional radiation, noise, or something generated inside the hardware itself on your end. Its also worth looking at whether youre looking at a fixed frequency or a changing frequency to pin things down further. Gesturing to a spectrogram, he notes that the long, persistent lines on the spectrogram are usually clues to more intentional transmissions. Intermittent squiggles are more often unintentional. Justin points at some that he puts down to the emissions from arc welders, sparking away as they do, and gives an example of what emissions from typical switching power supplies look like.\nThere are other hints to look out for, too. Real human-made signals tend to have some logic to them. Justin notes that real signals usually make efficient use of spectrum without big gaps or pointless repetition. Its also possible to make judgement calls as to whether a given signal makes sense for the band it appears to be transmitted in. Schedule can be a tell, too\u2014if a signal always pops up when your neighbor gets home at 6 PM, it might just be coming from their garage door remote. Justin notes a useful technique for hunting down possible nearby emitters\u2014Flipping on and off switches is a real good way of figuring out\u2014is it close to me or not?\nSDRs are hugely flexible, but they also have very open front-ends that can lead to some confusing output.\nNick follows up by discussing the tendency of sampling radios to show up unique bizarre transmissions that arent apparent on an analog receiver. One of the curses of the RTL-SDR is actually one of its strengths it has a completely wide open front end, notes Nick. Its ADC which is sampling and capturing the RF has basically nothing except an amplifier in between it and whatever crud youre putting into it. This provides great sensitivity and frequency agility, but theres a catch\u2014It will happily eat up and spit out lots of horrible stuff, says Nick. He goes on to explain various ways such an SDR might lie to the user. A single signal might start popping up all over the frequency band, or interfere with other signals coming in from the antenna. He also highlights a great sanity check for hunting down birdies\u2014If its always there, if its unchanging, if you unplug your antenna and you still hear it\u2014its probably generated in your radio!\nThe rest of the talk covers locating transmissions\u2014are they in your house, in the local community, or from even farther afield? It explores the technique of multilateration, where synchronized receivers and maths are used to measure the time differences seen in the signal at each point to determine exactly where a transmission is coming from. The talk also goes over common sources of noise in residential settings\u2014cheap PWM LED lights, or knock-off laptop chargers being a prime example in Nicks experience. Theres also a discussion of how the noise floor has shifted up a long way compared to 50 years ago, now that the world is full of so many more noise-emitting appliances.\nUltimately, the duo of Justin and Nick brought us a great pun-filled talk on sleuthing for the true source of radio transmissions. If youve ever wondered about how to track down some mystery transmitter, you would do well to watch and learn from the techniques explored within!"}

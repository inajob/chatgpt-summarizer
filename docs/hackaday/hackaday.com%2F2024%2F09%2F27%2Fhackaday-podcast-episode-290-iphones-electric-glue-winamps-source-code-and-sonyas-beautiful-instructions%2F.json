Well, probably. When a website gets to be this old, its a little hard to nail down when exactly things kicked off, but it seems like September of 2004 is about right. Theyll also go over the latest updates for the fast-approaching Hackaday Supercon, and announce the winner of another tough Whats That Sound challenge.\nFrom there, the conversation makes its way from the fascinating electrically-activated adhesive holding the latest iPhone together to pulsed-power lasers and a high flying autonomous glider designed and built by a teenager. Youll also hear about 3D printing on acrylic, home biohacking, and the Tiny Tool Kit Manifesto. Stick around to the end to hear the duo discuss the fine art of good documentation, and an incredible bodge job from Arya Voronova.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 290 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Turns 20-ish!\n\nHackaday Celebrates 15 years!\n\n\n2024 Hackaday Superconference Speakers, Round Two\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Davip] for getting a punch-tape reader/writer right.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nFind My Power Tool Battery\n\nGitHub  seemoo-lab/openhaystack\nGitHub  JJTech0130/pypush:Cross-platform iMessage POC\n\n\nHands-on With New IPhone\u2019s Electrically-Released Adhesive\n\nApple May Use Electrical Debonding For Battery Replacement\n\n\nMost Powerful Laser Diodes, Now More Powerful\n\nA Quickly-Hacked-Together Avalanche Pulse Generator\nAvalanche Pulse Generator Build Using 2N3904 \u2013 Kerry D.

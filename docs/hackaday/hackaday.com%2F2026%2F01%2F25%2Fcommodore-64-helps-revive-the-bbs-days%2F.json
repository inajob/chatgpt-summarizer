One of those systems was the Bulletin Board System, or BBS, which would have been a single computer, often in someones home, connected to a single phone line. People accessing the BBS would log in if the line wasnt busy, leave messages, and quickly log out since the system could only support one user at a time. While perhaps a rose-tinted view, this was a more wholesome and less angsty time than the modern algorithm-driven Internet, and it turns out these systems are making a bit of a comeback as a result.\nThe video by [The Retro Shack] sets up a lot of this history for context, then, towards the end, uses a modern FPGA-based recreation called the Commodore 64 Ultimate to access a BBS called The Old Net, a modern recreation of what these 80s-era BBS systems were like. This involves using a modern networking card that allows the C64 to connect to Wi-Fi access points to get online instead of an old phone modem, and then using a terminal program called CCGMS to connect to the BBS itself. Once there, users can access mail, share files, and even play a few games.\nWhile the video is a very basic illustration of how these BBS systems worked and how to access one, it is notable in that its part of a trend of rejecting more modern technology and systems in favor of older ones, where the users had more control. A retro machine like a C64 or Atari is not required either; modern operating systems can access these with the right terminal program, too. A more in-depth guide to the BBS can be found here for those looking to explore, and weve also seen other modern BBS systems recently.\nThanks to [Charlie] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "- \u6614\u306eBBS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "BBS\u3068\u3044\u3046\u53e4\u3044\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u63a5\u7d9a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u4e2d\u3002C64\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eBBS\u306b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6614\u306eBBS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- FPGA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u306b\u3088\u308bBBS\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306aBBS\u306e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u624b\u6bb5", "- BBS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u63a2\u6c42\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528"]}

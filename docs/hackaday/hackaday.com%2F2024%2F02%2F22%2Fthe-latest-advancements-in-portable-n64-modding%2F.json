The new build has an improved form factor, makes smart use of 3D printing and CNC cutting, efficiently uses PCBs to reduce wiring, and incorporates a battery level indicator. That last feature is a real quality of life improvement, nicely complementing the ability to charge over USB-C.\nWhats interesting about builds like this is that its all about the execution. The basic parts required to mod a classic games console into a portable unit are pretty well understood, and off-the-shelf modules like button assemblies exist to make the job far easier than it was back in the day when all had to be done from scratch. Weve admired [Chris Downing]s previous builds, and what differentiates one mod from another really comes down to layout and execution, and thats where the 5th GeN64 Portable shines.\n[Chris] makes great use of 3D printing (both filament-based and resin) to make fantastic custom buttons as well as an effective enclosure that feels good to hold. The front screen protector combines color printing on adhesive vinyl with a CNC-cut clear panel for a clean look, but the real winner is the even more refined use of fabricated PCBs to put everything exactly where he wants it.\nModifying existing hardware into a different shape tends to involve a lot of wiring. Lots of wires in a space-constrained device eats up both time and space while introducing points of failure, and invites mistakes during assembly. PCBs (especially flexible PCBs) are a great way to solve these problems, and the fact that they are so readily available nowadays is fantastic. The first link at the top of this post has some great pictures and details of the build process, and you can see the finished unit showcased in the video, embedded below.\nAll of these advancements mean its so much easier to build and test compared to having to solder assemblies point-to-point. Thats a valid way to make something, but it can also lead to a successful creation that one never wants to have to build again.\n"}

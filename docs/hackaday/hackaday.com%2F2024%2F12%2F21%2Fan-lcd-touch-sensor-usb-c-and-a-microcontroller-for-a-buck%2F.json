Hed found out that ordinary LCD screens could be used as simple touch sensors, and he had to try it for himself. He ended up building a little doohickey that combined USB C, an LCD display, and a touch interface, all for under a buck. You can check out the video below.\nThe key to this build was the CH32V003 CPU. Its a RISC-V microcontroller that runs at a healthy 48 MHz, and it costs just 10 cents in reasonable quantities. A PCB etched to mate with a USB C cable eliminates the need for a connector.\n[CNLohr] then gave the board a three-digit 7-segment LCD display from Aliexpress, which can be had for around 21 cents if you buy 100 or more. He then figured out how to drive the LCDs with a nifty trick that let the microcontroller use the display as a crude touch sensor. All in all, the total bill of materials for one of these things comes out somewhere under a dollar in quantity.\nIts mostly a random assemblage of tech glued together for a demo, but its a fun project. Its worth checking out even if its just to learn how to create an integral USB C port on your own PCBs. The way its achieved with the etched contacts and milled-out tabs is pure elegance. Files are on Github for the curious.\nWeve featured a ton of [CNLohrs] work over the years; the clear keytar was a glowing highlight, as were his early discoveries in the depths of the ESP8266.\n\n"}

Hed found out that ordinary LCD screens could be used as simple touch sensors, and he had to try it for himself. He ended up building a little doohickey that combined USB C, an LCD display, and a touch interface, all for under a buck. You can check out the video below.\nThe key to this build was the CH32V003 CPU. Its a RISC-V microcontroller that runs at a healthy 48 MHz, and it costs just 10 cents in reasonable quantities. A PCB etched to mate with a USB C cable eliminates the need for a connector.\n[CNLohr] then gave the board a three-digit 7-segment LCD display from Aliexpress, which can be had for around 21 cents if you buy 100 or more. He then figured out how to drive the LCDs with a nifty trick that let the microcontroller use the display as a crude touch sensor. All in all, the total bill of materials for one of these things comes out somewhere under a dollar in quantity.\nIts mostly a random assemblage of tech glued together for a demo, but its a fun project. Its worth checking out even if its just to learn how to create an integral USB C port on your own PCBs. The way its achieved with the etched contacts and milled-out tabs is pure elegance. Files are on Github for the curious.\nWeve featured a ton of [CNLohrs] work over the years; the clear keytar was a glowing highlight, as were his early discoveries in the depths of the ESP8266.\n\n", "title": "- LCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u6613\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "CNLohr\u304cLCD\u3092\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u52d5\u753b\u3068GitHub\u3067\u3002", "titles": ["- LCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u6613\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30c1\u30fc\u30d7\u306aRISC-V\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- PCB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6cd5", "- CNLohr\u306e\u5275\u4f5c\u6d3b\u52d5\u3068\u305d\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

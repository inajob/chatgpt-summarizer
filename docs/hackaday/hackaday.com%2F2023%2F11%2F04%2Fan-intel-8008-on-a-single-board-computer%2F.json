Baker], he made his Heathkit H8 run on a considerably older processor than it was made for. This time, apparently still not satisfied with the number of 8008 computers, he made an Intel 8008-based single-board computer.\nThe Mini-08, as [Scott] calls it, is based on his previous endeavour of downgrading the Heathkit H8. Its CPU board has even more memory than its predecessor at 128KiB RAM and ROM and an 8251 UART connected to a DB25 serial port. The entirely optional display board adds to that 10 digits of 7-segment displays, a backlit Cherry MX Blue hexadecimal keypad, a real-time clock and even a 4-voice sound generator!\n[Scott] has also done an impressive job with the software, porting BASIC, FORTH, a clone of Star Trek and some utilities to his Mini-08. He demonstrates both BASIC and FORTH by printing SCOTT WAS HERE in a for loop and finishes off by showing how to use some of the display board with FORTH.\nLike last time, he published design files and resources for you to enjoy. Overall, an interesting spin on the retro single-board computer concept.\nVideo after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!"}

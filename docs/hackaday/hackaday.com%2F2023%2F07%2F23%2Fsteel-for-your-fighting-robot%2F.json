Electromagnetic Field 2022 was last year, but they have continued to drop new videos. Among the latest batch is one from [Jennifer Herchenroeder], in which she discusses the steel used in her teams BattleBot, Hijinx. The result is a fascinating introduction to the metallurgy of iron and steel, and is well worth a watch.\nTo fully understand the selection of armor steel its necessary to start from first principles with iron, to look at its various allotropes, and understand something of how those allotropes form and mix in the steel making and metalworking processes. Were treated to a full description of the various tempering and hardening processes, before a panel-by-panel rundown of the various steels used by Hijinx.\nFor a Hackaday writer with a past in robot combat its fascinating to see how the design of robots has evolved over the decades since the British Robot Wars, and its particularly nice to see the current generation as part of our community. However, if youve tempted yourself, bear in mind that its not all plain sailing.\n\n"}

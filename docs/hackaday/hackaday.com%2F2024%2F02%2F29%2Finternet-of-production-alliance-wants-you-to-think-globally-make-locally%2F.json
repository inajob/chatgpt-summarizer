It would certainly be welcome after the pandemic-induced supply chain kerfuffles from toilet paper to Raspberry Pis. The Internet of Production Alliance (IoP) is designing standards to smooth this transition. [via Solarpunk Presents]\nIoP was founded in 2016 to build the infrastructure necessary to move toward a global supply chain based on local production of goods from a global database of designs instead of the current centralized model of production with closed designs. Some might identify this decentralization as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. They currently have developed two standards, Open Know-Where [PDF] and Open Know-How.\nOpen Know-Where is designed to help locate makerspaces, FabLabs, and other spaces with the tools and materials necessary to build a thing. The sort of data collected here is broken down in to five categories: manufacturing facility, people, location, equipment, and materials.\nOpen Know-How focuses on open designs having more consistent metadata to fast-track someone making it instead of trying to piece together the varying amounts of data available for a build. They even have a database of designs that already follow the Open Know-How standard. Given the focus on relief work and developing countries, there seems to be a higher density of medical and rescue equipment than you might find elsewhere. Some of the organizations you might recognize with members that helped develop the standard are the Open Source Hardware Association, the e-Nable Alliance, and Appropedia.\nWe have a HackChat about on-demand manufacturing, have pondered the opportunities for Open Source Hardware to be more like software, and have also seen biohackers pushing for more distributed production of drugs. Modular platforms like OpenStructures and the Open Robotic Platform could certainly help too.\n", "title": "\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u88fd\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u3068\u5206\u6563\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u672a\u6765\u300d", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u88fd\u9020\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306f\u5206\u6563\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3068\u611f\u3058\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002IoP\u306f\u3001\u5730\u5143\u3067\u306e\u5546\u54c1\u751f\u7523\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u306a\u4f9b\u7d66\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3001Open Know-Where\u3068Open Know-How\u306e2\u3064\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u88fd\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u3068\u5206\u6563\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u672a\u6765\u300d", "\u300cIoP\uff1a\u5730\u57df\u751f\u7523\u3078\u306e\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u306a\u79fb\u884c\u300d", "\u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u57fa\u76e4\uff1aOpen Know-Where\u3068Open Know-How\u300d", "\u300cIoP\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u958b\u767a\uff1a\u5730\u57df\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u57fa\u76e4\u3092\u6574\u3048\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u5206\u6563\u751f\u7523\u3078\u306e\u9053\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u300d"]}

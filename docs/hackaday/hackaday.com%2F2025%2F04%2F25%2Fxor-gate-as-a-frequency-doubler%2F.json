Of course, being an old part, it wont work at very high frequencies, but the circuit is super simple, just using the gate and an RC network. You can see a video of his exploration below.\nThe simple circuit seems like it should work, but in practice, it needed an extra component. In theory, the RC circuit acts as an edge detector. So, each edge of the input signal causes a pulse on the output as the second input lags the first.\n\nThat sounds good, but it looked terrible on the scope until a 1K resistor tied to the capacitor shifted the bias point of the gate. In all fairness, the original schematic used a Schmitt trigger gate, which may have made a difference had one been available. There were slight differences, though, depending on the type of device. An LS part, for example, didnt need the extra resistor.\nOf course, an RC network is just one way to delay the input, and the delay determines the width of the output pulse and constrains the input frequency and duty cycle. However, you could use other gates, including the other XOR gates in the package to realize a fast delay.\nFrequency doublers are very common at microwave frequencies, but they dont work in the same way. There are several ways to do it, but a common method is to use a nonlinear element to generate plenty of harmonics and then filter off everything but the second one. Or the third one, if you wanted a tripler instead.\n", "title": "\u53e4\u3044XOR\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u5668\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u53e4\u3044XOR\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u5668\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def\u3060\u304c\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u8ffd\u52a0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u3044XOR\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u5668\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aRC\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u500d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1aXOR\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u5668\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u500d\u5897\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406"]}

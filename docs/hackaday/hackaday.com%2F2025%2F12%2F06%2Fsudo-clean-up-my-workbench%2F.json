Why not, indeed? Well, all you need is a 17-foot-long X-axis and a gripper mechanism that can pick up any strange thing that happens to be on the bench.\nLike any good project, he did it step by step. Mounting a 17-foot linear rail on an accurately machined backplate required professional CNC assistance. He was shooting for a 1mm accuracy, but decided to settle for 10mm.\n\nWith the long axis done, the rest seemed anticlimactic, at least for moving it around. The system can actually support his bodyweight while moving. The next step was to control the arm manually and use a gripper to open a parts bin.\nThe arm works, but is somewhat slow and needs some automation. A great start to a project that might not be practical, but is still a fun build and might inspire you to do something equally large.\nWe have large workbenches, but we tend to use tiny ones more often in our office. We also enjoy ones that are portable.\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u898b\u3066\u7740\u60f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u3001\u4f5c\u696d\u53f0\u3092\u6383\u9664\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3060\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- 17\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u306eX\u8ef8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- CNC\u6280\u8853\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u6a5f\u69cb\u3067\u4f5c\u696d\u53f0\u3092\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u5927\u304d\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u904a\u3073\u5fc3\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

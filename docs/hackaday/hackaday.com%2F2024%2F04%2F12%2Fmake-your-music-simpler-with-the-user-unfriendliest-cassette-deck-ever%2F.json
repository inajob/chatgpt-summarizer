Or perhaps just easier to use, especially in the car. Whether your particular vintage favored CDs, cassettes, or even 8-tracks, being able to fish out that favorite album and slam it in the player while never taking your eyes off the road was a whole lot easier than navigating a playlist on a locked phone, or trying to control an infotainment system through soft buttons on a touch screen.\nIt seems like [Jarek Lupinski] is as much a Spotify Luddite as we are, since his tape-deck project is aimed to be as user-unfriendly as possible. Its just an auto-reversing cassette deck movement stripped bare of all useful appurtenances, like a way to fast forward or rewind. You just put a cassette in and it plays, start to finish, before auto-reversing to play the other side in its entirety. It doesnt even have a volume control  his cheeky advice is to listen to louder or quieter albums to solve that problem. Pretty easy, really, and not a EULA or advertisement in sight. Build files are available if you hate yourself enough to build one of your own.\nAll kidding aside, this is kind of a nice reminder of how much things have changed, and how much complexity weve layered onto the simplest of pleasures. If you like the minimalist approach of this project but not the deconstructed aesthetics, weve got you covered.", "title": "\u97f3\u697d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u7269\u7406\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u306f\u697d\u3057\u304f\u3001\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002 SpotifyLuddite\u306e[Jarek Lupinski]\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3057\u305f\u308a\u6b62\u3081\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3001\u97f3\u91cf\u8abf\u6574\u3082\u4e0d\u8981\u3002\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3092\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u97f3\u697d\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b", "\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306a\u3057: \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "Spotify\u306b\u62b5\u6297\uff1f\u81ea\u52d5\u53cd\u8ee2\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30a2\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u9b45\u529b"]}

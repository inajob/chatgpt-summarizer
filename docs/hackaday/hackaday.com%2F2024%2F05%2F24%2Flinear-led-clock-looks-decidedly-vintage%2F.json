If youve read these pages for any length of time, you know that [andrei.erdei] loves clocks as much as we do, and is always coming up with interesting ways of displaying the passage of time.\nThis one is a remix of some other linear RGB clocks, but the result is distinctly [andrei.erdei]s style. Theres nothing crazy going on under the hood here  its essentially a Wemos D1 mini running a strip of RGBs, and the microcontroller connects to a Wi-Fi router to get the time from a server. The magic is in the programming and the way the clock is read.\nThe brief but thorough demo video after the break does a much better job of explaining the display by showing various times of the day, but well give it a shot. For one thing, it uses 24-hour time exclusively. There are four groups of triangles; yellow, red, green, and blue which correspond to tens and units of hours, and tens and units of minutes.\nThe triangles light up in groups of three in the order depicted in the animation. At midnight, none of the triangles are lit up. Again, its best explained in the video, looking at various times of day.\u00a0 Plus you can see the neat-o startup animation.\nAre you more into sound than blinkenlights? Then this customizable bird clock may be for you.\n\n"}

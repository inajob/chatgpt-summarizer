Over on EDN, prolific [Stephen Woodward] explains how to use a precision Zener diode to get good results. [Stephen] takes you through the math for two topologies and another circuit that uses a pair of bipolar transistors.\nYou might wonder why you need a precise current source or sink. While it is nice to drive things like LEDs with a constant current, you probably dont need ultra-precise currents. However, charging a capacitor with a constant current produces a very nice linear voltage ramp. When you use a resistor to bias collector current in a bipolar amplifier, you are just poorly imitating a constant current source, too. Thats just two of many examples.\n\nThe circuits use a MOSFET to handle the actual current path, so there are a few differences depending on whether you want to sink or source current. You may wonder why a precision Zener diode needs an external Zener. However, if you read the text, youll note thats only if the input voltage is too high for the real Zener.\nThere are many techniques for manipulating currents. All good to have in your toolbox.", "title": "- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u96fb\u6d41\u6e90\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u6cd5\u3068Zener\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30bc\u30ca\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u56de\u8def\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u96fb\u6d41\u6e90\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u6cd5\u3068Zener\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u5b9a\u96fb\u6d41\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u30d0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7cbe\u5bc6\u96fb\u6d41\u5236\u5fa1", "- MOSFET\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u96fb\u6d41\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u6280\u8853", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u96fb\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

Sure, rocket fuel isnt gold, but on the moon its worth more than its weight in the yellow stuff. So there would be reason to be skeptical if this Blue Alchemist was actually an alchemist, and not a chemical reactor under development by the Blue Origin corporation.\nThe chemistry in question is quite simple, really: take moon dust, which is rich in aluminum silicate minerals, and melt the stuff. Then its just a matter of electrolysis to split the elements, collecting the gaseous oxygen for use in your rockets. So: moon dust to air and metals, just add power. Lots and lots of power.\nMelting rock takes a lot of temperature, and the molten rock doesnt electrolyse quite as easily as the water were more familiar with splitting. Still, its very doable; this is how aluminum is produced on Earth, though notably not from the sorts of minerals you find in moon dust. Given the image accompanying the press release, perhaps on the moon the old expression will be modified to make oxygen while the sun shines.\nHackaday wasnt around to write about it, but forward-looking researchers at NASA, expecting just such a chemical reactor to be developed someday, proposed an Aluminum/Liquid Oxygen slurry monopropellant rocket back in the 1990s.\nThats not likely to be flying any time soon, but of course even with the Methalox rockets in vogue these days, there are appreciable cost savings to leaving your oxygen and home. And were not biologists, but maybe Astronauts would like to breathe some of this oxygen stuff? Weve heard its good for your health.", "title": "\u6708\u306e\u7802\u304b\u3089\u9178\u7d20\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3\u304c\u6708\u306e\u5875\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u9178\u7d20\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["\u6708\u306e\u7802\u304b\u3089\u9178\u7d20\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u9752\u3044\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b\uff1a\u6708\u9762\u3067\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u71c3\u6599\u88fd\u9020", "\u6708\u306e\u9271\u77f3\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "NASA\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0/\u6db2\u4f53\u9178\u7d20\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8cc7\u6e90\uff1a\u6708\u9762\u306e\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u8cc7\u6e90\u3092\u6d3b\u7528"]}

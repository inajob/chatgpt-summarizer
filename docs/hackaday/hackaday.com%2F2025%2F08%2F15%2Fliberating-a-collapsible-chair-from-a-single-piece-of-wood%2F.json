He uses various types of saw, chisels, a manual drill, and various other hand tools. His workspace is a humble plank with a large clamp attached. At the end he does use a powered hot air gun to heat the finish he uses to coat the final product.\n\nWe love videos like this which communicate, record, and capture old know-how. Even in our electrified future with factory-made commodities everywhere, were all still gonna appreciate having something portable to sit on.

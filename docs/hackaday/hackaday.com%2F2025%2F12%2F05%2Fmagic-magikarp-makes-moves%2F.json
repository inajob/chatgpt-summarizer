A celebrity bigger than the biggest politicians or richest movie stars, there\u2019s almost nothing that could beat Billy. That is, until [Kiara] from Kiaras Workshop built a Magikarp version of Big Mouth Billy Bass.\nSizing in at over 2 entire feet, the orange k-carp is able to dance, it is able to sing, and it is able to stun the crowd. Magikarp functions the same way as its predecessor; a small button underneath allows the show to commence. Of course, this did not come without its challenges.\nStarting the project was easy, just a model found online and some Blender fun to create a basic mold. Dissecting Big Mouth Billy Bass gave direct inspiration for how to construct the new idol in terms of servos and joints. Programming wasn\u2019t even all that much with the use of Bottango for animations. Filling the mold with the silicone filling proved to be a bit more of a challenge.\nAfter multiple attempts with some minor variations in procedure, [Kirara] got the fish star\u2019s skin just right. All it took was a paint job and some foam filling to get the final touches. While this wasn\u2019t the most mechanically challenging animatronic project, we have seen our fair share of more advanced mechanics. For example, check out this animatronic that sees through its own eyes!\n\n", "title": "- \u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u9b5a\u8a95\u751f\uff01\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30d3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u2015\u30d7\u7248", "body": "\u30ad\u30a2\u30e9\u304c\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30fb\u30d3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u6b4c\u3044\u8e0a\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u9b5a\u8a95\u751f\uff01\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u30d3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u2015\u30d7\u7248", "- \uff12\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30b0\u30ab\u30eb\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- \u30d3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30b9\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb", "- \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eBottango\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u5145\u586b\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30de\u30ae\u30ab\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u82e6\u52b4"]}

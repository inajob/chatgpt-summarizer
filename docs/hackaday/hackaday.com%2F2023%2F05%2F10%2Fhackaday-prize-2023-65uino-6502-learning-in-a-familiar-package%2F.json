Which as you might be able to guess, is a 6502-based microcomputer wedged into an Arduino Uno form factor (well, almost wedged in, but well let it slide) The premise is simple, older micros are easier to understand, the board can be build up from new-old or salvaged stock, and thats more chips on boards and less sitting on a dusty shelf. After all, even though the 6502 in its original form is long obsolete, its far better to be pushing some electrons around, than sitting there decaying.\nThe OLED frame buffer is bigger than the hosts entire RAM. No problem!\nFrom an educational perspective, the first lesson is the hand-soldering of through-hole DIP components and a smattering of straightforward surface mount parts in their supporting roles.\u00a0 Then on to setting up the cc65 toolchain. To say this is a pure 6502 system is a little misleading, it actually uses the 6507 device variant, which is a die-bond variant of the same device but with only 28 of the pins utilized.\nThe use of the 6532 RIOT (RAM-I/O-Timer) chip provides two 8-bit ports of GPIO as well as a timer and 128 bytes of SRAM, making the design more compact. There is a socket that will accept a 24 or 28-pin E(E)PROM device, with the extra four pins removable and the PCB snapped off if fitment into a standard Uno case is desirable. Neat!\nFull hardware build and PCB design (using KiCAD) are available on the 65uino GitHub page. Just remember folks, with everything minimal 6502 related \u2014 some assembly required :D\nWe see the 6502 a lot, lets be fair. But why not? Heres a slightly more practical board with a bit more resources, an absolute beast of a luggable dual-6502 machine, and yet another 6502 verilog implementation ready to be dropped into a spare corner of a FPGA project that needs a little extra.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

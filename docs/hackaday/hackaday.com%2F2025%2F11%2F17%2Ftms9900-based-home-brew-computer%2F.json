The computer will use the TI series 10 Insight data terminal.\nIn the video, [Usagi Electric] spends a fair bit of time making the rack-mount casing for his computer and its two power supplies. The UART for 300-baud terminal access is currently in breadboard format, but it is set up to transmit and is functional so far! Up next will be support for receiving. The UART hes using is the TR1602B, and he spends some time reviewing its datasheet in this video.\nIf youre interested in the TMS9900, you might like to check out TMS9900 Retro Build and How The TI-99/4A Home Computer Worked.\n", "title": "- TMS9900\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Usagi Electric\u304cTMS9900\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u30022\u53f0\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u7aef\u672b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- TMS9900\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- Usagi Electric\u304c\u4f5c\u308b\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u975e\u52b9\u7387\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308bTMS9900\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1aTI-99/4A\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- TR1602B UART \u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u89e3\u8aac\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5"]}

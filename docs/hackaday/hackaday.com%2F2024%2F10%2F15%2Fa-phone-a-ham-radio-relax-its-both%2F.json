It\u2019s Both!", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2024/10/15/a-phone-a-ham-radio-relax-its-both/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/vhf.png", "original_content": "A lot of hams like to carry a VHF radio. Of course, nearly everyone wants to carry a phone. Now, thanks to the kv4p HT, you dont have to carry both. The open-source device connects to your Android smartphone and turns it into a radio transceiver. You can build it yourself for about $35. Check out the video below.\nThe device uses an ESP32 and only transmits one watt, but it has lots of features like APRS and scanning.\n\nThe brain is an ESP-WROOM-32. Theres also a ham radio module that is easily imported.\u00a0 The rest is fit, finish, and software. The PCB is fairly simple and inexpensive. A 3D-printed case completes things.\nThere is a new version of the PCB that hasnt been tested as of this post, but the older version (1.5) seems to work ok, too, if you dont want to risk trying the 1.6 version and you dont want to wait.\nWe always marvel at how many building blocks you can get now. Grab a computer and a radio, and use your phone for power and a user interface. This would have been an enormous project to complete not long ago and now it is an hours time and $35. Youll probably spend as much time ordering parts as building.\nIf your phone mostly trades cat memes, it fits right in with old ham tech. Just watch the antenna.\n"}

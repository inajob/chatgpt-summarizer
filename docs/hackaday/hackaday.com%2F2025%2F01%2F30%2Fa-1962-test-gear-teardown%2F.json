[Thomas] got a Boonton meter from 1962 that wasnt in very good shape, but it was a fun teardown, as you can see in the video below. The meter had signs of a prior modification or repair, but still a nice peek into some vintage gear.\nThe meter could measure up to 260 MHz (or megacycles in 1962 parlance) and had some unusual features, including an oddly wired AC transformer and a voltage stabilizer to ensure a constant AC voltage at the input. We have to admit, we miss the days when our test equipment had gears inside. Then again, we dont miss the tubes and the high-voltage stuff. Because of the high frequency, the unit even has an oddball acorn tube that you rarely see.\nYou may notice the meter has a mirror in a strip on the face. This is a common feature of high-precision analog meter movements. The idea is that you move your head until the needle hides its own reflection in the mirror to avoid parallax errors in your reading.\nThis isnt the first Q meter weve seen; in fact, one was pretty similar but a bit older. While you can get a lot of new gear cheap these days, theres still something to be said for vintage test equipment.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aQ\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "body": "1962\u5e74\u88fd\u306eQ\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u8a9e\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aQ\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u5256", "\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u6e2c\u5b9a", "Q\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6e2c\u308b\uff1a1962\u5e74\u306e\u30dc\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u63a2\u7d22", "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5177\u3067\u306e\u8996\u5dee\u8aa4\u5dee\u56de\u907f\u6cd5", "\u65b0\u65e7\u306e\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1a\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u3068\u306f"]}

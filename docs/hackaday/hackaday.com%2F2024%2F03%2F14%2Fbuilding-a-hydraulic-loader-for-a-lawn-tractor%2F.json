They save you the effort of pushing a mower around and theyre fun to drive, to boot. However, they can be even more fun with the addition of some extra hardware. The hydraulic loader build from [Workshop from Scratch] demonstrates exactly how.\nThe build is based around a John Deere LX188 lawn tractor, which runs a 17 horsepower Kawasaki engine and features a hydrostatic transmission. Its a perfectly fine way to mow a lawn. In this case, though, its given new abilities with the addition of a real working loader. Its fabricated from raw steel from the arms right down to the bucket. Its all run from a hydraulic pump, which is mounted to the engine via an electromagnetic clutch. The clutch can be engaged when its desired to use the hydraulics to actuate the loader.\nAs you might expect, the humble lawn tractor isnt built for this kind of work. Thus, to support the extra equipment, the mower was also given some frame reinforcements and a wider track for stability.\nIf youre trying to give your neighbours mower envy, this is how you do it. Or, you could go another route entirely. Video after the break.\n\n"}

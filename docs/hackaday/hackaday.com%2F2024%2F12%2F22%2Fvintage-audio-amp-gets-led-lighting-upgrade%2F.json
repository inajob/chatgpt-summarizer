However, when this stuff starts getting into its third or fourth decade after production, things start to wear out. Chief among them\u2014the little incandescent bulbs that light up the dials with such a beautiful glow. [Piffpaffpoltrie] was suffering just this problem on an old Technics amp, and decided to go for a more modern upgrade.\n\nReplacing the original bulb with a like unit was undesirable\u2014even if many last for decades, [Piffpaffpoltrie] didnt want to have to tackle this job again in the future. Instead, an LED swap was the order of the day. A short strip of warm-white LEDs seemed to be the perfect solution, with three LEDs in series being just about right for the 11-volt supply used for the original bulbs. The only problem was that the stereo supplied the bulbs with AC, not DC. Thus, a quick bridge rectifier circuit was thrown in, along with some series resistors. This wrangled the voltage into a straighter line and delivered the right voltage level to drive the LEDs nicely and smoothly.\nThe result is a nicely-illuminated set of power meters on this vintage Technics amp. Weve seen some neat LED swaps in the past, too, including this tricky motorcycle lamp upgrade.

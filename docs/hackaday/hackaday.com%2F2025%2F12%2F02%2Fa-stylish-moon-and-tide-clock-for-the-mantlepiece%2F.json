Alternatively, you could save a lot of hassle by just building this moon and tide clock from [pjdines1994] instead.\nThe build is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which is hooked up to a real-time clock module and a Waveshare 3.7-inch e-paper display. Upon this display, the clock draws an image relevant to the current phase of the moon. As the write-up notes, it was a tad fussy to store 24 images for all the different lunar phases within the Pi Pico, but it was achieved nonetheless with a touch of compression. As for tides, it covers those too by pulling in tide information from an online resource.\nIts specifically set up to report the local tides for [pjdines1994], reporting the high tide and low tide times for Whitstable in the United Kingdom. If youre not in Whitstable, youd probably want to reconfigure the clock before using it yourself. Unless you really want to know whats up in Whitstable, of course. If you so wish, you can set the clock up to make its own tide predictions by running local calculations, but [pjdines1994] notes that this is rather more complicated to do. The finished result look quite good, because [pjdines1994] decided to build it inside an old carriage clock that only reveals parts of the display showing the moon and the relevant tide numbers.\nWeve featured some other great tide clocks before, like this grand 3D printed design. If youve built your own arcane machine to plot the dances of celestial objects, do be sure to let us know on the tipsline!"}

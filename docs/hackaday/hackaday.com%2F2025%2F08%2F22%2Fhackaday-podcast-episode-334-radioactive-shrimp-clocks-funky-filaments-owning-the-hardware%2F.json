The extra spicy shrimp discussion makes a perfect segue into an overview of a pair of atomic One Hertz Challenge entries, after which theyll go over the latest generation of 3D printer filament, using an old Android smartphone as a low-power Linux server, some tips for creating better schematics, and Lordes specification-bending transparent CD. Finally, youll hear about how the nature of digital ownership influences the hardware we use, and on the other side of the coin, how open source firmware like QMK lets you build input devices on your terms.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nOr download in DRM-free MP3 to enjoy with your shrimp.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 334 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nFood Irradiation Is Not As Bad As It Sounds\nWalmart shrimp may have been exposed to radioactive material, FDA says\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Gesundheit]\u00a0for getting guessing this weeks sound.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\n2025 One Hertz Challenge: Atomic Decay Clock Is Accurate But Not Precise\n\n2025 One Hertz Challenge: Timekeeping At One Becquerel\nDecaying clocks  Antiquarian Horological Society\nGammaclock\nTime Capsule Expo 70\nDeriving 1 Hz from Candle Flame Oscillations\n\n\nSuggested Schematic Standards\n\n\nShould You Try Printing With Polypropylene?\n\nMorPhlex: The TPU Filament That Goes Soft After You Print It\n\n\nFrom Smartphone To A Home Server\nA Solderless, Soluble Circuit Board\n\nHackaday Europe 2025: David Cuartielles  What if the Future (Of Electronics) Was Compostable?\n\n\nWhy Lorde\u2019s Clear CD Has So Many Playback Issues\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nAdjustable Allen Key After All These Years\nThe PC In Your Pico\nThe VLF Transformation\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nI, 3D Printer\nReviving A Piece Of Yesterday\u2019s Tomorrow\nSilent Speak And Spell Gets Its Voice Back\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nThe Terminal Demise Of Consumer Electronics Through Subscription Services\nInstant Macropad: Just Add QMK\n", "title": "\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u30a8\u30d3\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3068\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u98df\u6599\u4f9b\u7d66", "body": "Hackaday\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u7b2c334\u56de\u3067\u306f\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u30b7\u30fc\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u30843D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u30a8\u30d3\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3068\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u98df\u6599\u4f9b\u7d66", "\u30a2\u30c8\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u767a\u8868", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529bLinux\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "\u900f\u660eCD\u306e\u4ed5\u69d8\u554f\u984c\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6240\u6709\u6a29\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "QMK\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5"]}

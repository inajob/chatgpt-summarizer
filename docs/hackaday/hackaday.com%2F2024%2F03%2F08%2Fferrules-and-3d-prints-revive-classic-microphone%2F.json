True, we spend a great deal of time combing through a vast corpus of material to bring you the best from all quadrants of the hacking galaxy, but we do manage to find a few minutes here and there to dip into the shop for a quick hack or two.\nOur own [Jenny List] proves that with this quick and easy vintage microphone revival. The mic in question is a Shure Unidyne III, a cardioid pattern dynamic microphone that has been made in the millions since the 1950s. Shes got a couple of these old classics that have been sidelined thanks to their obsolete Amphenol MC3M connectors. The connectors look a little like the now-standard XLR balanced connector, but the pin spacing and pattern are just a touch different.\nLuckily, the female sockets in the connector are just the right size to accept one of the crimp-on ferrules [Jenny] had on hand with a snug grip. These were crimped to a length of Cat 5 cable (dont judge) to complete the wiring, but that left things looking a bit ratty. Some quick OpenSCAD work and a little PLA resulted in a two-piece shell that provides strain relief and protection for the field-expedient connections. Its not [Roger Daltry] secure, mind you, but as you can see in the video below the break its not bad  nothing a few dozen yards of gaffers tape couldnt fix. Come to it, looks like The Who were using the same microphones. Small world.\n\n", "title": "\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u5fa9\u6d3b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Hackaday\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3082\u6642\u9593\u3092\u5272\u304f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30aa\u30df\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305fAmphenol MC3M\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u3001\u4fdd\u8b77\u3068\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4e8c\u91cd\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u88fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u5fa9\u6d3b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30fb\u30e6\u30cb\u30c0\u30a4\u30f3III\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u6539\u4fee", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3SCAD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u4fee\u7406", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c85\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u6280\u8853", "\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u63a5\u7d9a\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

On each Tiny Tapeout chip are multiple designs, each representing an individual project, and in use the chip is configured to present that project to its pins. Given enough Tiny Tapeout chips it was inevitable that someone whould eventually make a project using two such functions, and heres [Sylvain Munaut] with an SDR using Tiny Tapeouts 6 and 7.\nAt its heart is [Carsten Wulff]s 8 bit ADC from Tiny Tapeout 6, fed by [Kolos Kobl\u00e1sz]s Gilbert cell RF mixer from Tiny Tapeout 7. Theres a local oscillator provided by an RP2040, and a USB interface board which sends the data to a host computer where GNU Radio does the maths. On the bench its receiving an FM signal generated around 30MHz by a signal generator, followed by some slightly indistinct commercial radio stations.\n\nIts clear that there are many better SDRs than this one, and that (as yet) Tiny Tapeout is perhaps not the radio enthusiasts choice. But it does demonstrate beautifully how the chips are more than just curios, and were definitely in the era of useful on-demand ASICs.\nThe video is below the break, meanwhile you can learn about Tiny Tapeout from [Matt Venn]s Supercon talk.\n\n"}

Although natural evolution has done much of the legwork here already, figuring out new sequences and their functionality is a daunting task where increasingly deep learning algorithms are being applied. As [Bo Ni] and colleagues report in a research article in Science Advances, the hardest challenge is designing a protein sequence based on the desired functionality. They then demonstrate a way to use a generative model to speed up this process.\nThey set out to design proteins with specific mechanical properties, for which they used the known unfolding characteristics of various protein sequences to train a diffusion model. This approach is thus more akin to the technology behind image generation algorithms like DALL-E than LLMs. Using the trained diffusion model it was then possible to generate likely sequences of which the properties could then be simulated, with favorable results.\nAs a large data set aid, such a diffusion model could conceivably be very useful in fields even beyond protein synthesis, automating tedious tasks and conceivably speeding up discoveries.", "title": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bAI\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "body": "\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u8cea\u306f\u5c11\u6570\u306e\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u304b\u3089\u6210\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u304b\u3089\u69d8\u3005\u306a3D\u5f62\u72b6\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002\u6df1\u5c64\u5b66\u7fd2\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u914d\u5217\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u767a\u898b\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002[Bo Ni]\u6c0f\u306f\u7279\u5b9a\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u8cea\u914d\u5217\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3001\u62e1\u6563\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u751f\u6210\u3057\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bAI\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "\u7279\u5b9a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u8cea\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u751f\u6210\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u95a2\u9023", "\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u8cea\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u7279\u6027\u8a2d\u8a08\u3078\u306eAI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3\u5408\u6210\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316"]}

Elliot Williams is joined by Jenny List for this weeks roundup of whats cool in the world of hardware. We start by reminding listeners that Hackaday Europe is but a month away, and that a weekend immersed in both hardware hacking and the unique culture offered by the city of Berlin can be yours.\nThe stand-out hack of the week is introduced by Elliot, Henrik Forst\u00e9ns synthetic aperture radar system mounted on a cheap quadcopter, pushing the limits of construction, design, and computation to create landscape imagery of astounding detail. Most of us will never create our own SAR system, but we can all learn a lot about this field from his work. Meanwhile Jenny brings us Sylvain Munauts software defined radio made using different projects that are part of Tiny Tapeout ASICs. The SDR isnt the best one ever, but for us it represents a major milestone in which Tiny Tapeout makes the jump from proof of concept to component. We look forward to more of this at more reasonable prices in the future. Beyond that we looked at the porting of Google Find My to the ESP32, how to repair broken zippers, and tuning in to ultrasonic sounds. Have fun listening, and come back next week for episode 309!\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nWed love it if you downloaded the MP3.\n\nEpisode 308 Show Notes:\nNews:\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [make piece not war] for guessing Olivia  Signal Identification Wiki\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nBudget-Minded Synthetic Aperture Radar Takes To The Skies\nA Tiny Tapeout SDR\nGoogle FindMy Tools Run On An ESP32\nHack That Broken Zipper!\nHearing What The Bats Hear\nMake Custom Shirts With A 3D Print, Just Add Bleach\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nOn The Original Punched Cards\nDIY Microwave Crucibles\nMake A Secret File Stash In The Slack Space\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\nA Twin-Lens Reflex Camera That\u2019s Not Quite What It Seems\nA Tiny Computer With A 3D Printed QWERTY Keyboard\nRunning Doom On An Apple Lightning To HDMI Adapter\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nNASA Taps Webb To Help Study 2032 Asteroid Threat\nThe Solar System Is Weirder Than You Think\nHow Magnetic Fonts Twisted Up Numbers And Saved Banking Forever\n"}

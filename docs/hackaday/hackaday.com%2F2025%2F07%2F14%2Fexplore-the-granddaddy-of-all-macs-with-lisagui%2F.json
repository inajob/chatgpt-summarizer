Which doesnt mean many mortals got their hands on one; with only about 10,000 sold, they were never common, and are vanishingly rare nowadays. Enter [Andrew Yaros], who has graced the world with LisaGUI, an in-browser recreation of the Lisa Office System in Javascript.\nLisas GUI varies from modern conventions in a few interesting ways. For one, it is much more document-focused: if you double-click on LisaType, you do not start the program. Instead you tear off a document from the pad icon of LisaType, which you can then open with another double click. The desktop is also not a folder for files to live permanently, but a temporary space. You can set aside a file to the desktop, but its home on disk is unchanged.\nUnlike the family of Mac emulators, LisaGUI does not purport to be a perfect replica. [Andrew] has made a few quality-of-life improvements for modern users, as well as a few innovations of his own. For instance, menus are now sticky on the Lisa, you had to hold down the mouse to keep them open, and release on the appropriate entry. LisaGUI leaves the menu open for you to click the entry, as on a later Macintosh.\nObviously the menu bar clock and FPS counter are not native to the Lisa; nor is the ability to theme the icons and change (1-bit) colour palettes. The ability to draw unique icons to assign to documents is all [Andrew], but is something we wish we had back in the day. He also makes no attempt to enforce the original aspect ratio, so youll be dragging the window to get 4:3 if thats your jam.\nRight now it does not look as though theres much original software aside from LisaType. We would have loved to see the famous LisaProject, which was the original killer app that led NASA to purchase the computer. Still, this is an Alpha and its possible more software is to come, if it doesnt run afoul of Apples IP. Certainly we are not looking too hard at this gift horses chompers. Whats there is plenty to get a feel for the system, and LisaGUI should be a treat for retrocomputer enthusiasts who arent too anal about period-perfect accuracy.\nWe stumbled across this one in a video from [Action Retro] in which he (the lucky dog) also shows off his Lisa II, the slightly-more-common successor.", "title": "- \u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u4e0a\u306eLisa GUI\u4f53\u9a13", "body": "Apple\u306eLisa\u306f\u521d\u306e\u4e00\u822c\u5411\u3051GUI\u642d\u8f09\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3002Andrew Yaros\u304c\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305fLisaGUI\u306f\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u5411\u3051\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u305f\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u4e0a\u306eLisa GUI\u4f53\u9a13", "- Lisa\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u81ea\u5728\u306aLisaGUI\uff1a\u4eca\u98a8\u306e\u5229\u4fbf\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01LisaOfficeSystem\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248", "- \u8ffd\u4f53\u9a13\uff01Lisa GUI\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u9032\u5316"]}

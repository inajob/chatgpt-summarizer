But the hacks were cool  see what I did there?  and provided much-needed relief. Join us as we listen in on the world of bats, look at a laser fit for a hackerspace, and learn how to make an array of magnets greater than  or less than  the sum of its parts. Therell be flying eggs, keyboards connected to cell phones, and everything good about 80s and 90s cable TV, as well as some of the bad stuff. And you wont want to miss Elliot putting Dan to shame with the super-size Quick Hacks, either, nor should you skip the Cant Miss sweep with a pair of great articles by Al Williams.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in the comments!\n\nDownload a long series of ones and zeroes that, when appropriately interpreted, sound like two people talking about nerdy stuff!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\n\nEpisode 228 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Prize 2023: Meet The Assistive Tech Finalists\nSupercon 2023 Is On, We Want You!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Jaxx] for guessing the sound.\u00a0 It was OtamatoneDX Brazil (Aquarela do Brasil) played by its inventor, the man behind the incomparable Maywa Denki.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nListening To Bats As They Search For Food\n\nWorried About Bats In Your Belfry?

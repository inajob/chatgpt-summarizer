Since then it seems some of the criticism has caught up with the company, for not only have they modified their terms to allow forking, theyve reacted to a bunch of claimed GPL violations by removing offending files. Perhaps How-To-Geek are right in describing it all as an absolute mess.\nThe forking amendment means that with luck well start seeing a few modified players descending from the Winamp code, and it seems that the GPL violations are more embarrassing technicalities than show-stoppers, but we have to wornder whether or not this makes for something with any more than historical interest. Perhaps its value stands in a lesson for corporate entities in how\u00a0not to release their source, which sadly we expect will be taken by other organisations as an excuse not to do so.\nIf youre following the Winamp source code saga you can read our coverage from when it came out. It will be interesting to see where this story goes."}

Alkaline, lithium, and even some mature rechargeable cells with a couple thousand cycles under their belt were all compared. There are a few interesting results that will can help you get the most from your money the next time youre battery shopping.\nThe video embedded below demonstrates a set of tests that we recommend you check out, but the short version is that more expensive (non-rechargeable) lithium cells outperform their alkaline peers, especially when it comes to overall longevity, ability to perform under high-drain conditions, and low temperatures. Lithium cells also cost more, but theyre the right choice for some applications.\nSome brands performed better and others worse, but outside of a couple stinkers most were more or less comparable. Price however, was not.\nAs for how different brands stack up against one another, many of them are more or less in the same ballpark when it comes to performance. Certainly there are better and worse performers, but outside of a couple of stinkers the rest measure up reasonably well. Another interesting finding was that among rechargeable cells that were all several years (and roughly 2,200 charge-discharge cycles) old, a good number of them still performed like new.\nProbably the single most striking difference among the different cells is cost  and were not just talking about whether lithium versus alkaline AAs are more cost-effective in the long run. Some brands simply cost twice as much (or more!) than others with comparable performance. If youre in a hurry, jump to [Project Farm] presenting the final ranked results at 19:45 in.\nRelying on brand recognition may save you from buying complete junk, but its clearly not the most cost-effective way to go about buying batteries.\u00a0 These findings are similar to an earlier effort at wide-scale battery testing which also determined that factoring in price-per-cell was too significant to ignore.\n\n", "title": "- \u5404\u7a2eAA\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "body": "AA\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4fa1\u683c\u5dee\u304c\u5927\u304d\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5206\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5404\u7a2eAA\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f03\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "- \u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u304c\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30ea\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4e0a\u56de\u308b\u7406\u7531", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u683c\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u7528\u9014", "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u9593\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u5dee\u3068\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u76f8\u95a2", "- rechargeable\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u9577\u5bff\u547d\u3068\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

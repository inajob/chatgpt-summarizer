It thus came with its own CRT, and a distinctive vertical screen form factor.\nFor all that though, it was just a games console, but there were rumors that it might have become more. [Intric8] embarked on a quest to find some evidence, and eventually turned up what little remains in a copy of Electronic Games magazine. A keyboard, RAM and ROM expansion, and a wafer drive were in the works, which would have made the Vectrex a quirky equal of most of what the likes of Commodore and Sinclair had to offer.\nIts annoying that it doesnt specify which issue of the magazine has the piece, and after a bit or browsing archive.org were sorry to say we cant find it ourselves. But the piece itself bears a second look, for what it tells us about the febrile world of the 8-bit games industry. This was a time of intense competition in the period around the great console crash, and developers would claim anything to secure a few column inches in a magazine. Its not to say that the people behind the Vectrex wouldnt have produced a home computer add-on for it if they could have done, but we remember as teenagers being suckered in by too many of these stories. We still kinda want one, but wed be surprised if any ever existed.\nIf you have a Vectrex, its possible to give it a light pen."}

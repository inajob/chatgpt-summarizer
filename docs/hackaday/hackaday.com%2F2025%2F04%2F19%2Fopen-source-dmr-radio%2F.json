But [QRadioLink] decided to tackle a homebrew and open source DMR modem.\nThe setup uses a LimeSDR, GNU Radio, and Codec2. There are some other open DMR projects, such as OpenRTX. So we are hopeful there are going to be more choices. The DMR modem, however, is only a proof-of-concept and reuses the MMDVMHost code to do the data link layer.\n[QRadioLink] found several receiver implementations available, but only one other DMR transmitter  actually, a transceiver. Rather than use an AMBE hardware device or the potentially encumbered mbelib codec, the project uses Codec2 which is entirely open source.\nTheres a lot of explanation about the data collection to prepare for the project, and then a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of the implementation. You might enjoy the video below to see things in action.\nIf you just want to listen to DMR, its easy. If Codec2 sounds familiar, it is part of M17.\n\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDMR\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDMR\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fQRadioLink\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDMR\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- LimeSDR\u3068GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u7121\u7dda", "- Codec2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- DMR\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3068\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- QRadioLink\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u8a73\u7d30"]}

Thats not special anymore. A camera that\u00a0draws what it sees, though? Thats kind of fun. Thats precisely what [Jens] has built\u2014an instant sketch camera!\nThe sketch camera looks like a miniature drawing easel, holding a rectangular slip of paper not dissimilar in size to the Polaroid film of old. The 3D-printed frame rocks a Raspberry Pi controlling a simple pen plotter, using SG90 servos to position the drawing implement and trace out a drawing. So far, so simple. The real magic is in the image processing, which takes any old photo with the Pi camera and turns it into a sketch in the first place. This is achieved with the OpenCV image processing library, using an edge detection algorithm along with some additional filtering to do the job.\nIf youve ever wanted to take Polaroids that looked like sketches when youre out on the go, this is a great way to do it. Weve featured some other great plotter builds before, too, just few that are as compact and portable as this one. Video after the break.\n\n"}

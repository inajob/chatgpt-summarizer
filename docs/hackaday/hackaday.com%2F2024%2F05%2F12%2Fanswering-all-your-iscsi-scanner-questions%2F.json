So, could you have an iSCSI network scanner? [xssfox] details her journey making a Canoscan FS4000US film scanner work over iSCSI, sparked by someones overly-confident StackOverflow comment that it couldnt be done. Nothing in the spec said it couldnt actually work, however, and after figuring out a tentative architecture, a hardware setup was put together.\nNo flatbed scanners with SCSI ports could be found on the cheap, so a film scanner had to be procured. After figuring out a few hitches with the loading mechanism and getting a test image locally, it was time to try and build up the software setup, tearing through SCSI compatibility and cabling, driver and PCI pass-through woes, bluescreens, and intermediate software having dropped some of the necessary features by now. Still, [xssfox] eventually exported the scanner as an iSCSI target  and, on the other end of the network, successfully connected to it and completed a scan. The StackOverflow answer was wrong, after all.\nIts fun to see how far old technology can go, and get answers to questions you never knew you had. Whether youre reminiscing about SCSI days or wondering what the technology about, weve talked about it aplenty, from a retrospective to modern-day experiments, repurposing old SCSI hardware for modern SATA ports, a Raspberry Pi implementation, an emulator, and a fair bit more.\nWe thank [Valentijn Sessink] and [adistuder] for sharing this with us!"}

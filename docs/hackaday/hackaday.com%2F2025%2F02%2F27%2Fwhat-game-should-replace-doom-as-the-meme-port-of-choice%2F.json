The first-person shooter was an instant hit upon its mrelease at the end of 1993. It was soon ported off the PC platform to a number of consoles with varying success. Fast forward a few years, and it became a meme. People were porting Doom to everything from thermostats to car stereos and even inside Microsoft Word itself.\nThe problem is that porting Doom has kind of jumped the shark at this point. Just about every modern microcontroller or piece of consumer electronics these days has enough grunt to run a simple faux-3D game engine from 1993. Its been done very much to death at this point. The time has come for a\u00a0new meme port!\nGood Game\nDoom became a popular meme port for multiple reasons. For one, its just complex and resource-intensive enough to present a challenge, without being so demanding as to make ports impractical or impossible. Its also been open-source for decades, and the engine has been hacked to death. Its probably one of the best understood game engines out there at this point. On top of that, everybody plays Doom at some point, and it was one of the biggest games of the 90s. Put all that together, and youve got the perfect meme port.\nHowever, you can always have too much of a good thing. Just as The Simpsons\u00a0got old after season 10 and Wonderwall is the worst song you could play at a party, Doom ports have been overdone. But what other options are there?\nQuake\nQuake made a huge leap forward from the pseudo-3D engine used in Doom and Wolfenstein 3D.

It merely created the illusion of a 3D environment with clever 2D tricks, and didn\u2019t have the free-rolling mouselook that we now take for granted. Released in 1996, Quake was a real step forward. The game featured real-time 3D rendering, making it a far more demanding game for mid-1990s computers to run.\nCompared to Doom, Quake\u2019s fully-3D engine presents a more demanding challenge for those trying to port it to unusual hardware. At the same time, like Doom, the engines source code has been available under an open-source license since 1999. Thus, it\u2019s readily available to anyone who wishes to tinker with it. It\u2019s also a widely-popular game well embedded in the broader hacker consciousness. If your friends are showing off their Doom ports, pulling off a Quake port is an easy way to one-up them.\nHalf-Life/Counter-Strike\nHalf-Life set a new standard for FPS games when it came out in 1999.

Released in 1999, it became popular for its rich science-fiction plot and compelling gameplay. Funnily enough, Half-Life ran on the GoldSrc engine, which was developed and heavily modified from the original Quake engine. Most crucially, it added robust AI and skeletal animation features, which brought the FPS genre to new levels of immersion. Half Life soon became a popular basis for mods, spawning the immensely-successful Counter Strike amongst many others.\nThe source code for GoldSrc was never officially released, but the engine is well understood and has been reverse-engineered by numerous projects like Xash3D and FreeHL. These community-created engines could provide a solid starting point for any porting efforts.\nYou won\u2019t have much luck getting a full-version of Half-Life running on a space-constrained platform\u2014the game took up over 250 MB of disk space, compared to Quake, at under 80 MB, and Doom, which fit on a couple of floppy disks. Still, it\u2019s not supposed to be easy\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be hard! With that said, few people expect you to include a full single-player game with a meme port. Usually, one playable level is enough. In Half-Life\u2019s case, maybe that could be the mind-numbing unskippable intro that has you riding a tram for twenty minutes. Alternatively, do a multiplayer Counter-Strike port that lets you run around de_dust. That should be enough.\nCrysis: The Impossible Flex\nAh, Crysis. The tropical jungle game that brought high-end PCs to their knees when it launched in 2007. For over a decade, But can it run Crysis? was a tongue-in-cheek benchmark for computing power. If that phrase sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a reskin of a much older saying\u2014\u201dCan it run DOOM?\u201d For this reason alone, it deserves a mention here.\nThe problem with Crysis is that it\u2019s a thoroughly modern game with thoroughly modern requirements. Running on CryEngine2, it featured advanced lighting, motion blur and depth of field effects, and even a multi-threaded physics engine that let you blast chunks out of the environment. Getting even a heavily downscaled version of Crysis running on inappropriate hardware would thus be the ultimate flex in the hardware hacking community.\n\nCrysis followed Far Cry, continuing Cryteks theme of putting its name in the title of its games, and its focus on building games in tropical environs.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s just one problem\u2014source code for Crysis nor CryEngine 2 was ever really released to the public. The closest you could get is the open-source Open 3D engine, which is related to CryEngine by a few degrees of separation. Without the source, it\u2019s hard to really port at all. You could remake Crysis on whatever platform you like, but it\u2019s not really the same thing.\nUltimately, though, this just ups the challenge. You need to be charismatic enough, rich enough, or a good enough thief, to get the source code out of Crytek\u2019s archives in the first place. Then you can pull off the meme port to end all meme ports.\nWhy Bother?\nImpractical ports aren\u2019t about actually playing a game on weird hardware. Sure, a few people might have enjoyed tapping around Doom on an iPod, but by and large, that\u2019s beyond the point. They do, however, serve several purposes beyond just bragging rights. In reality, they\u2019re a test of skill, and a way to explore what\u2019s really possible on a random piece of hardware. Can you play Half Life on a Toyota infotainment system from 2022? Well, there\u2019s one good way to find out!\nThe next time youre looking at your smart dishwasher and thinking about making it run Doom, consider aiming higher. Your project might take longer and cause more headaches, but imagine the satisfaction when youve got Gordon Freeman fighting headcrabs on your smart TV, or Trent Reznors Quake soundtrack pumping out of your e-reader. Doom is great, but it\u2019s been done. Its time to move on!\n"}

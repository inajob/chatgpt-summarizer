To measure S21, the SDR feeds a series of tones to the device under test, and reads the device\u2019s output from one of the SDR\u2019s inputs. By comparing the amplitude of the input to the device\u2019s output, a Python program can calculate S21 over the range of tested frequencies. To find S11, [FromConceptToCircuit] put an RF bridge in line with the device being tested and connected the bridge\u2019s output to the SDR\u2019s second input. This allowed the program to calculate the device\u2019s impedance, and from that S11.The RF bridge and other components introduce some inaccuracies to the measurements, so before making any other measurements, the system is calibrated with both a through connection and an open circuit in place of the tested device. The RF bridges directivity was the biggest limiting factor; transfer back from the bridge\u2019s output line caused the reflection under load to exceed the reflection of an open circuit in some frequency ranges, at which point the analyzer couldnt accurately operate.[FromConceptToCircuit] was eventually able to make measurements throughout most of the 0.1-3 GHz range with a dynamic range of at least 10 dB, and expects a more directive RF bridge to give even better results. If you\u2019d like to repeat the experiment, he\u2019s made his Python program available on GitHub.We\u2019ve previously seen [FromConceptToCircuit] use the Pluto SDR to make a spectrum analyzer. We\u2019ve also featured a guide to the Pluto, covered a project that improved its frequency stability, and seen it used to transmit video.\n"}

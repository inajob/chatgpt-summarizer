The project has come a long way since Linksys was forced to release the GNU-licensed code for the original WRT54G router from which the project takes its name. Theyve marked the occasion in an interesting manner: by proposing that the plethora of devices supported by the OS be joined by a fully upstream-supported reference hardware platform.\nSpec-wise its what you would expect for a hackable router platform in 2024. A MediaTek chipset can be found at its centre, but the hardware is not in this case the important bit. Here will be a platform that wont have to rely on proprietary manufacturer BLOBs, and which will thus likely continue to have up-to-date kernel support long into the future. So many enticing SBCs fall in this regard, and many retain ossified kernel versions after their manufacturers tire of them as a result.\nIt appears that the future of this project will be subject to an OpenWRT community vote, and we sincerely hope that it will come to fruition. Meanwhile, we couldnt resist a peek at the status of the router that started it all, by our reckoning the original WRT54G was last supported by the OS over a decade ago.", "title": "\"OpenWRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e20\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3044\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u308b\"", "body": "OpenWRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f20\u5e74\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u652f\u6301\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306eWRT54G\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f10\u5e74\u524d\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"OpenWRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e20\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3044\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u308b\"", "\"2024\u5e74\u7248\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u516c\u958b\"", "\"\u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fcBLOB\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u305b\u305a\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u7d99\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\"", "\"OpenWRT\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u6295\u7968\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u672a\u6765\u304c\u6c7a\u307e\u308b\u304b\uff1f\"", "\"\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306eWRT54G\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f10\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u524d\u306b\u7d42\u4e86\""]}

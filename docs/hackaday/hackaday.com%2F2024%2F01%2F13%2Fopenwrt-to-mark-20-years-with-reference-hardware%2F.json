The project has come a long way since Linksys was forced to release the GNU-licensed code for the original WRT54G router from which the project takes its name. Theyve marked the occasion in an interesting manner: by proposing that the plethora of devices supported by the OS be joined by a fully upstream-supported reference hardware platform.\nSpec-wise its what you would expect for a hackable router platform in 2024. A MediaTek chipset can be found at its centre, but the hardware is not in this case the important bit. Here will be a platform that wont have to rely on proprietary manufacturer BLOBs, and which will thus likely continue to have up-to-date kernel support long into the future. So many enticing SBCs fall in this regard, and many retain ossified kernel versions after their manufacturers tire of them as a result.\nIt appears that the future of this project will be subject to an OpenWRT community vote, and we sincerely hope that it will come to fruition. Meanwhile, we couldnt resist a peek at the status of the router that started it all, by our reckoning the original WRT54G was last supported by the OS over a decade ago."}

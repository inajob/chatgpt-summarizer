We see a lot of people complain about hacks embedded in YouTube videos, social media threads, Discord servers, Facebook posts, IRC channels, different degrees of open-sourcing, licenses, searchability, and monetization. I personally have my own share of frustrations with a number of these factors.\nIts common to believe that hacking as a culture doesnt thrive until a certain set of conditions is met, and everyone has their own set of conditions in mind. My own dealbreaker, as you mightve seen, is open-sourcing of code and hardware alike  I think thats a sufficiently large barrier for hacking being repeatable, and repeatability is a big part of how hacking culture spreads.\nThis kind of belief is often self-limiting. Many people believe that their code or PCB source file is not a good contribution to hacking culture unless it meets a certain cleanliness or completeness standard. This is understandable, and I do that, too.\nToday, Id like to argue against my own view, and show how imperfect publishing helps build hacking culture despite its imperfections. Lets talk about open-source in context of 3D printing.\n\nThe Snazzy Ugly Duckling\nOne little-spoken aspect of 3D printing is how few models are open-source. Printable models published exclusively as STLs are commonplace, STEPs are much less popular, and from my experience, its soul-crushingly rare to see a source file attached to a model on Printables. I struggle to say thats a good thing, and quite obviously, that negatively impacts 3D printing culture  getting into 3D modeling is that much harder if you cant reference the sources for 95% of models you might get inspired by.\nOf course, part of that is that 3D CADs are overwhelmingly closed-source paid software, and there are like five different ones with roughly equal shares of usage. Its hard to meaningfully share sources from within a paywalled siloized market. Also, unlike software source code, STLs are very much cross-platform. Electronics has a way better analogy for STLs, theyre just like gerbers  gerbers are easy to export, and to inexperienced people, theyll feel like all that anyone would ever need.\nFor a quick example  out of these eight Printables models taken at random, only the drawers mini-cabinet has a source file attached.\nThen, theres a self-consciousness and perfectionism. While rare, Ive seen I will clean this up and publish later happen in 3D printing spaces too  its a thoroughly non-viable promise there too, but I get why people say that, Ive personally made and failed on such promises a good few times myself. Im glad that this isnt a popular excuse so far, but, as more people adopt OpenSCAD, Blender, and FreeCAD, with their universally-accessible files, maybe well see it resurface.\nAsking for 3D model sources should probably become part of hacker culture, just like it helped with software. I dont think its great that 3D printing so often implies closed-source 3D models, and undoubtedly that has limited the growth of 3D modeling as a hobby. I strongly wish I could git clone the 3D model projects I find online, and theres a whole lot of models that are useless to me because I cant git clone and modify them.\nAt the same time? 3D printing carries the hacker flag quite strongly, despite the imperfections, and you can notice it by just how often 3D printing appears on our pages. We can and should point at aspects of hacker culture that 3D printing doesnt yet represent, and while at it, we benefit from the technology, as much as its imperfections hurt us.\nWhere Is Hackerdom Found?\nWould I argue the same about Discord servers? Mastodon-hosted threads? YouTube videos? GitHub repos with barely-documented code? For sure. Theres no shortage of criticism about those, mostly about accessibility issues. Servers and videos are often not externally discoverable, which is surprisingly painful for hacker cultures ability to thrive and grow. At the very least, we are badly missing out  for instance, Id say Discord servers and YouTube videos alike are in dire need of external log/transcript hosting capabilities, and tech-oriented Discord servers specifically could benefit from public logs in the same way that modern Discourse forums have them from the get-go.\nThats for the disadvantages. As for upsides, YouTube videos make hardware hacking into entertainment for potential hackers not enthralled by scrolling through a blog interspersed with pictures, and, they position hacking culture in front of people whod otherwise miss out on it. Lets take [DIY Perks], a hugely popular YouTube channel. Would that dual-screen laptop build we covered have worked out great as a blog post, or maybe as a dual post-video, as some hackers do? For sure. At the same time, it gets hacking in front of peoples faces.\n\nDiscord blows as a platform, and Ive written a fair bit about just how much it blows. One such snippet is in the article I wrote about the Beepy project, where the Discord server was crucial to growing Beepy as a community-contributed project. Would people benefit from the Beepy project having publicly available logs? Most certainly, and Id argue its hurt the Beepy project being more externally discoverable. Is that all?\nDiscord has been an unprecedented communications platform for the Beepy project, and wed outright lose out if there werent hardware hacking communities thriving on Discord, like Hackaday Discord does. I think we should remedy these kinds of problems by building helper tools and arguing for better cultural norms, just like we did with software licenses, because giving up on platforms like Discord currently has a significantly subpar cost-benefit analysis.\nWhat about imperfect code? Sometimes, a hacker figures out a small part of a sensors protocol or a basic feature, and as much as the code might be insufficient or hastily written, they publish it. Have you ever stumbled upon such a repository? I have, sometimes I was happy, and sometimes I was disappointed, but either which way, such code tend to require extra work. In the end, Ive noticed that it almost always helped way more than it hurt, which in turn has eventually led to me publishing more and more.\nI think wed benefit from a culture where publish later after cleanup is replaced by heres the code, and I might push some cleanup commits later. Its a better contribution to hacker culture and to people who enjoy your work, and the might part makes it more honest. Itll also get your publishing muscles in better shape so that youre quick to post about things you really ought to post about. For what its worth, I dont think it hurts if this is assisted by social media likes, too.\nStrength Through Presence\nSurvival of hacker culture has so far heavily relied on its presence in media all across, and an ability to press the maybe I can hack too button in other peoples brains through that presence. That said, every non-open 3D model, Discord server with non-public logs, YouTube channel with non-transcribed videos, or a completely ephemeral TikTok channel, still palpably paves a way for future hackers to join our communities, wherever hackerdom might be within ten years time.\nI think the key to informational impedance mismatches is making it easier for people to meet the high standards we expect, and helping people meet them where appropriate, in large part, by example. It looks like hacking is strongest when present everywhere, even when some seams, and I hope that this kind of overwhelming presence helps us overcome modern-day unique cultural hurdles in a way we couldnt hope for just a decade ago.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6587\u5316\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u516c\u958b\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5316\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8ad6\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6587\u5316\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- \u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u516c\u958b\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5316\u3092\u80b2\u3080\u7406\u7531", "- Discord\u3084YouTube\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5316\u306e\u6210\u9577", "- \u81ea\u5df1\u7ba1\u7406\u3068\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u6587\u5316\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u516c\u306e\u5834\u3067\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u5171\u6709\u3092\u63a8\u9032\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

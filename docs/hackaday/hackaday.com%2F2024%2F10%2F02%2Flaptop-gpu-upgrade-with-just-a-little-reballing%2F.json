It doesnt help theyre not often upgradeable, so youre stuck with what youve bought  unless, say, youre a hacker equipped some tools for PCB reflow? If thats the case, welcome to [TechModLab]s video showing you the process of upgrading a laptops soldered-on NVIDIA GPU, replacing the 3070 chip with a 3080.\nYou dont need much  the most exotic tool is a BGA rework station, holding the mainboard steadystiff and heating a specific large chip on the board with an infrared lamp from above. This one is definitely a specialty tool, but weve seen hackers build their own. From there, some general soldering tools like flux and solder wick, a stencil for your chip, BGA balls, and a $20 USB-C hotplate are instrumental for reballing chips  tools you ought to have.\nReballing was perhaps the hardest step of the journey  instrumental for preparing the GPU before the transplant. Afterwards, only a few steps were needed  poking a BGA ball that didnt connect, changing board straps to adjust for the new VRAM our enterprising hacker added alongside the upgrade, and playing with the driver process install a little. Use this method to upgrade from a lower-end binned GPU youre stuck with, or perhaps to repair your laptop if artifacts start appearing  its a worthwhile reminder about methods that laptop repair shops use on the daily.\nItching to learn more about BGAs? You absolutely should read this article series by our own [Robin Kearey]. Weve mostly seen reballing used for upgrading RAM on laptop and Raspberry Pi boards, but seeing it being used for an entire laptop is nice  its the same technique, just scaled up, and you always can start by practicing at a smaller scale. Now, it might feel like weve left the era of upgradable GPUs on laptops, and todays project might not necessarily help your worries  but the Framework 16 definitely bucks the trend.\n\n", "title": "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306eGPU\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY", "body": "\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u5341\u5206\u306a\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3079\u308b\u307b\u3069\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306eGPU\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002BGAs\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u3076\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306eGPU\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY", "BGA\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306eGPU\u30923070\u304b\u30893080\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b", "\u5c0f\u578bUSB-C\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u4fee\u7406\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u4f7f\u3046\u6280\u8853\u3092\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u8a66\u3059"]}

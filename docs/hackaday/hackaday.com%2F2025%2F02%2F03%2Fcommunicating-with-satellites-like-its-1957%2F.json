Of course, there was no two-way communication with this satellite, and it only lasted a few weeks before its batteries died. Here in the future, though, there are many more satellites in orbit and a few are specifically meant for ham radio operators. And, like the 50s, it doesnt take too much specialized equipment to communicate with them, although now that communication can be two-way.\nThe first step in this guide by [W2PAK] is to know where these satellites are in the sky. The simplest way to do that is to use a smartphone app called GoSatWatch and, when configured for a specific location, shows the satellites currently overhead. After that its time to break out the radio gear, which can be surprisingly inexpensive. A dual-band handheld is required since satellite uplink and downlink can be on different bands, and the antenna can be made from simple parts as well as [W2PAK] demonstrates in a separate video. Combined, this can easily be done for less than $100. [W2PAK] also goes over the proper format and etiquette for a satellite contact as well, so a new operator can pick it up quickly.\nUsing satellites as repeaters opens up a lot of capabilities when compared to terrestrial communications. Especially for operators with entry-level licenses who are restricted to mostly VHF and UHF, it adds a challenge as well as significantly increased range compared to ground-based repeaters and line-of-sight communications. There are plenty of activities around satellites that dont require a license at all, too, like this project which downloads weather imagery from weather satellites.\n\n", "title": "- \u4eba\u5de5\u885b\u661f\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u4eba\u5de5\u885b\u661f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u53cc\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5165\u9580\u8005\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4eba\u5de5\u885b\u661f\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3067\u885b\u661f\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u628a\u63e1\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3067\u4e8c\u65b9\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u885b\u661f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5165\u9580\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u5929\u5019\u885b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

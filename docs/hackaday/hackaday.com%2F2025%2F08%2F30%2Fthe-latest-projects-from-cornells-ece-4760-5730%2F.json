The list of projects for spring this year includes forty write-ups  if you havent got time to read the whole lot you can pick a random project between 1 and 40 with: shuf -i 1-40 -n 1 and let the cards fall where they may. Or if youre made of time you could spend a few days watching the full playlist of 119 projects, embedded below.\nWe wont pick favorites from this semesters list of projects, but having skimmed through the forty reports we can tell you that the creativity and acumen of the students really shines through. If the name [Hunter Adams] looks familiar that might be because weve featured his work here on Hackaday before. Earlier this year we saw his Love Letter To Embedded Systems.\nWhile on the subject, [Hunter] also wanted us to know that he has updated his lectures, which are here: Raspberry Pi Pico Lectures 2025. Particularly these have expanded to include a bunch of Pico W content (making Bluetooth servers, connecting to WiFi, UDP communication, etc.), and some fun lower-level stuff (the RP2040 boot sequence, how to write a bootloader), and some interesting algorithms (FFTs, physics modeling, etc.).\n\n"}

[Learn Electronics Repair] had heard from another YouTuber that it was a piece of junk. However, he wanted to look at it compared to another inexpensive scope, the Rigol DS1052E. His results were different from what we usually hear. To be clear, he didnt think it was a perfect scope, but he did find it very usable for his purpose.\nThe 46-minute-long video does more than just a casual look. He uses both scopes in some real-world measurements. If you are in the market for a scope in this price range, it is worth the time to watch.\n\nHonestly, we are as guilty as the next person of getting obsessed with specifications. One PC is good because it scores 1% higher on a benchmark than another. But in real life,\u00a0 youll never notice the difference. That may be whats happening here.\nOn the other hand, everyones use cases are different. Besides that, your choice of a tool as integral to your day as a scope or a soldering iron is pretty personal. You like what you like, and it doesnt always have to make sense.\nIf you have either of these scopes  or both  what do you think of the review? Leave us a note in the comments. We actually looked at the original review that this video refers to. We know that not all FNIRSI scopes live up to their supposed specifications.\n", "title": "\u300cFNIRSI 1014D \u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\uff1f\u300d", "body": "YouTube\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30ebLearn Electronics Repair\u304c\u3001\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u306aFNIRSI 1014D\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5370\u8c61\u3082\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306f\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u51fa\u305f\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u91cd\u8996\u6d3e\u306b\u306f\u5411\u304b\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u8cfc\u5165\u691c\u8a0e\u8005\u306b\u306f\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cFNIRSI 1014D \u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u6bd4\u8f03: FNIRSI 1014D vs. Rigol DS1052E\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u9078\u3073\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u306b\u3088\u308b\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u3053\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u5e2f\u306e\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u300d"]}

Although the paper itself is sadly paywalled with no preprint available, its fairly easily summarized and illustrated with details from the Supplementary Data section. The polymer used is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which when exposed to an electron beam (electron-beam lithography) undergoes certain changes that become apparent when said water is added.\nThe polymer is hygroscopic, but the electron beam modifies the extent to which a specific area swells up, thus making it possible to create patterns that depend on the amount of electron beam exposure. In order to colorize the polymer, complex cavities are created that modify the angular distribution of light, as illustrated in the top image from the Supplemental Data docx file.\nBy varying the concentration of IPA versus water, the intermediate swelling states can be controlled. Although this sounds pretty advanced, if you look at the supplementary videos that are already sped up a lot, you can see that it is a very slow process. Compared to an octopus and kin whose ability to alter their own skin texture and coloring is legendary and directly controlled by their nervous system, this isnt quite in the same ballpark yet, even if its pretty cool to watch.", "title": "\u6c34\u5206\u3067\u8272\u3068\u6a21\u69d8\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u6280\u8853  ", "body": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u3001\u6c34\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u6a21\u69d8\u3068\u8272\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["\u6c34\u5206\u3067\u8272\u3068\u6a21\u69d8\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u6280\u8853  ", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u9769\u65b0  ", "\u904e\u9177\u306a\u74b0\u5883\u4e0b\u3067\u306e\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u5909\u5316\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b  ", "\u6c34\u3068IPA\u306e\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u81a8\u5f35\u72b6\u614b  ", "\u7bc0\u8db3\u52d5\u7269\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u8272\u5f69\u5909\u5316\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u6700\u524d\u7dda  "]}

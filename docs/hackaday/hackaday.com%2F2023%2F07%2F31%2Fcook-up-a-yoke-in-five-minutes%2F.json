But for those gaming on a budget this can seem a little overwhelming and daunting. We all have to start somewhere, though, so if youre looking for your first semi-realistic flight simulator control mechanism take a look at this yoke which can be cobbled together for almost no money or time.\nThe yoke can be built around any optical mouse that happens to be lying around. A custom housing for it is constructed from cardboard, which lets it sit above a cardboard tube which functions as the control interface. This mechanism rests in a cardboard box it uses as a frame, with a yoke-styled control interface built out of packing foam at the front. One optional modification to the device allows it to have more realistic control throw, and another replaces the cardboard tube with a wooden dowel to give the device a little more strength.\nWhile relatively quick and easy to build, it works as a fully-functional yoke in flight simulator programs like FlightGear almost effortlessly, mostly thanks to the fact that it is based on a nearly unmodified mouse. Assuming you have a mouse in your parts drawer and have access to some sort of cardboard, its estimated to take not much longer than five minutes to put together. But if youre looking for something DIY thats a little more substantial, its not too much of a step up to another DIY yoke weve featured before which is centered around an Arduino and a few 3D-printed parts.\nThanks to [Stephen] for the tip!", "title": "\u4e88\u7b97\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "body": "\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u6291\u3048\u3066\u30bb\u30df\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u6728\u306e\u68d2\u306a\u3069\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3089\u308c\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3068\u8a55\u5224\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6642\u9593\u3092\u304b\u3051\u305a\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u65b9\u306b\u3082\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e88\u7b97\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u6bb5\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u6bb5\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3084\u6728\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6539\u826f\u3082\u53ef\u80fd", "5\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "DIY\u306e\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080"]}

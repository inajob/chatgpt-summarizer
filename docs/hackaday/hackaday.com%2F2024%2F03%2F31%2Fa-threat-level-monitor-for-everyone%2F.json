Those of us whove been around for a bit longer than wed like to admit would see that, scratch our heads, and ask Have we ever not lived in uncertain times? If all this uncertainty is getting to you though, you can now reassure yourself as [Ian Williams] has, with a threat level monitor which displays the UKs current level of projected fear threat level.\nThe build is fairly straightforward in hardware terms, with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a Pimoroni e-paper display pHAT. The software grabs the current level of doom from in this case the UK governments website with a nifty bit of Python code, and turns it into an easy to read alert level bar.\nSo if youre genuinely worried that the sky might fall upon your head you can now gain reassurance from a small piece of electronic hardware. If you feel things are really going south though, how about converting your basement into a fallout shelter?"}

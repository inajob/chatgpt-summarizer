Thus its surprisingly rare to see hacks on printers as printers, rather than printer hacks using the parts for some other purpose. This makes [Oelison]s brain-swap of a Casio thermal label printer a welcome surprise, as it puts an ESP32 in the machine instead of whatever Casio gave it.\nThe value in the hack lies in the insight it gives into how a thermal printer works as much as it does in the ESP32 and the Casio, as it goes into some detail on the various signals involved. The strobe line for instance to enable the heater is a nuance we were unaware of. The resulting printer will lose its keyboard and display, but\u00a0 make up for it in connectivity.\nDespite what we said earlier this isnt the first label printer hack weve seen. A previous one was Linux-based though.", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020", "body": "\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306bESP32\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3059\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff01\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63a5\u7d9a\u6027\uff1aESP32\u642d\u8f09\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u6790\u3068\u6539\u9020\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u65e2\u5b58\u6280\u8853\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u6539\u9020\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

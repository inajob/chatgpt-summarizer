Especially when it comes to things like props, these details can push a good Halloween costume to great with the right touches. [Jonathan]s friends daughter will be well ahead of the game thanks to these additions to a toy guitar which is part of her costume this year.\nThe toy guitar as it was when it arrived had the capability to play a few lackluster sound effects. The goal here was to get it to play a much more impressive set of songs instead, and to make a couple upgrades along the way as well. To that end, [Jonathan] started by dismantling the toy and investigating the PCBs for potential reuse. He decided to keep the buttons in the neck of the guitar despite their non-standard wiring configuration, but toss out the main board in favor of an ESP32. The ESP32 is tasked with reading the buttons, playing a corresponding song loaded on an SD card, and handling the digital to analog conversion when sending it out to be played on the speaker.\nThe project doesnt stop there, though. [Jonathan] also did some custom mixing for the songs to account for the lack of stereo sound and a working volume knob, plus he used the ESP32s wireless capabilities to set the guitar up as a local file server so that songs can be sent to and from the device without any wires. He also released the source code on the projects GitHub page for anyone looking to use any parts of this project. Dont forget theres a Halloween contest going on right now, so be sure to submit the final version of projects like these there!\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u8863\u88c5\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6539\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b", "body": "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u4eee\u88c5\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u73a9\u5177\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306f\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3067\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092ESP32\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u3001SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u66f2\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30df\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u7121\u7dda\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306fGitHub\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u53ef\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u8863\u88c5\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6539\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u97f3\u697d\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u3059\u308b", "\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u97f3\u97ff\u3084\u97f3\u91cf\u30ce\u30d6\u304c\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30df\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u884c\u3046", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306b\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\uff01\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u5fdc\u52df\u4f5c\u54c1"]}

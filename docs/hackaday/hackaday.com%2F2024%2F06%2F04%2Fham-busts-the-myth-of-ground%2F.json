Your house has a copper rod in the ground. But [Kristen K6WX] has news: the idea of ground is kind of a myth. She explained at a talk at the recent ARRL National Convention, and if you didnt make it, you can watch it in the video below.\nThe problem is analogous to finding something that is standing still. You really can only talk about something standing still relative to something else. Sure, you might be standing still outside a building, but seen from the moon, you and the building are spinning around at about one revolution per day. If you were sitting on the sun and not burning up, youd see lots of motion of everything, and, of course, the sun itself is moving in the right frame of reference.\n\nSo whats ground? Just a common reference between two things. [Kristen] gets into RF grounds, DC grounds, and phasors. If youve ever wanted to ground your antenna or deal with RF interference, youll find a lot of information in this 45-minute video.\nThe name ground is, perhaps, unfortunate. You do want earth grounding for lightning protection, but what most of us think of as ground is just a convention. Need a -9V battery? Just reverse your meter leads, and there you go.\nGetting a good common reference can be maddening. Weve looked at way too many ground loops before.\n", "title": "\u5730\u9762\u306e\u8003\u3048\u65b9\u3092\u518d\u8003\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u795e\u8a71", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u5730\u9762\u3078\u306e\u63a5\u5730\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001Kristen K6WX\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001\u63a5\u5730\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8003\u3048\u306f\u4e00\u7a2e\u306e\u795e\u8a71\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u63a5\u5730\u306f\u5358\u306a\u308b2\u3064\u306e\u7269\u4f53\u306e\u5171\u901a\u53c2\u7167\u70b9\u306b\u904e\u304e\u306a\u3044\u3002RF\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3001DC\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3001\u4f4d\u76f8\u5b50\u306b\u3064\u3044\u306645\u5206\u9593\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u5730\u9762\u306e\u8003\u3048\u65b9\u3092\u518d\u8003\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u795e\u8a71", "RF\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u304b\u3089DC\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u307e\u3067\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5730\u9762\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "45\u5206\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u300c\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u300d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "\u5730\u9762\u306f\u4e00\u4f53\u4f55\uff1f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u6df1\u6398\u308a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u300c\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u306e\u7406\u8ad6", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u5fdc\u7528"]}

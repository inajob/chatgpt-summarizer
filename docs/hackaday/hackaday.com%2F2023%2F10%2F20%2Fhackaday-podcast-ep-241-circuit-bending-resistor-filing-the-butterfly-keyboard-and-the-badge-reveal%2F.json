Theyll go over circuit bending, self-driving cars, and a solar camera that started as a pandemic project and turned into an obsession. Youll also hear about Linux on the Arduino, classic ICs etched into slate, and an incredible restoration of one of the most interesting Thinkpads ever made. Stay tuned until the end to hear about a custom USB-C power supply and the long-awaited Hackaday Supercon 2023 Vectorscope badge.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in the comments!\n\nDownload your own, unlimited-edition MP3 of this weeks podcast.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 241 Show Notes:\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThis record-breaking Whats That Sound has its winner!

Its a long-running effort to produce in 74 logic a faithful replica of the MOS Technologies CIA, the integrated I/O and timer chip found in so many of the 1980s Commodore machines. When we first covered it there was only one PCB, now the project has grown to a stack of three, with the remaining functions intended to fit on two more boards.\nIt was very common at the time for chips such as the CIA to integrate a set of common 8-bit peripherals onto one piece of silicon, both in general purpose with almost all functions of the original now implemented. hips and in more manufacturer specific parts such as this one. A project like this one is valuable because it provides a dive into the now less-common\u00a0 world of interfacing directly to a microprocessor data and address line. Its unlikely that many Commodore 64s will end up with this stack of boards inside them, but its not impossible the design may help a few old machines when put on an FPGA.\nMeanwhile, remember its not the only custom 1980s home computer chip replaced with 74 logic."}

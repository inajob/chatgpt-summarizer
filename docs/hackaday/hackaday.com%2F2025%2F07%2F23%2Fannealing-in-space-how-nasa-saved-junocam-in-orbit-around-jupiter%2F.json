After a mission extension, its currently orbiting Jupiter, allowing for many more years of scientific data to be gathered using its instruments. One of these instruments is the JunoCam (JCM), a visible light camera and telescope. Unfortunately the harsh radiation environment around Jupiter had led many to believe that this camera would fail before long. Now it seems that NASA engineers have successfully tested a fix.\nLocation of the Juno spacecrafts science instruments.\nAlthough the radiation damage to JCM was obvious a few dozen orbits in  and well past its original missions 34 orbits  the big question was exactly was being damaged by the radiation, and whether something could be done to circumvent or fix it. The good news was that the image sensor itself was fine, but one of the voltage regulators in JCMs power supply was having a bad time. This led the engineers to try annealing the affected part by cranking up one of the JCMs heaters to a balmy 25\u00b0C, well above what it normally is kept at.\nThis desperate step seemed to work, with massively improved image quality on the following orbits, but soon the images began to degrade again. Before an approach to Jupiters moon Io, the engineers thus tried it again but this time cranked the JCMs heater up to eleven and crossed their fingers. Surprisingly this fixed the issue over the course of a week, until the JCM seems as good as new. Now the engineers are trying their luck with Junos other instruments as well, with it potentially providing a blueprint for extending the life of spacecraft in general.\nThanks to [Mark Stevens] for the tip."}

How strange? Well, in a recent video, he looks at filaments that require 445 C. Even the build plate has to be super hot. He also looks at filament that seems like iron, one that makes you think it is rubber, and a bunch of others.\nAs you might expect, hes not using a conventional 3D printer. Although you might be able to get your more conventional printer to handle some of these, especially with some hacking. There is filament with carbon fiber, glass fiber, and more exotic add-ons.\nMost of the filaments need special code to get everything working. While you might think you cant print these engineering filaments, it stands to reason that hobby-grade printers are going to get better over time (as they already have). If the day is coming when folks will be able to print any of these on their out-of-the-box printer, we might as well start researching them now.\nIf you fancy a drinking game, have a shot every time he changes shots and a double when the Hackaday Prize T-shirt shows up.\n\n", "title": "- \u5947\u5999\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "body": "Zack\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u9ad8\u6e29\u3084\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u9032\u5316\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5947\u5999\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- 445\u2103\u3092\u8981\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u7279\u7570\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u901a\u5e38\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u6280\u8853", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3084\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

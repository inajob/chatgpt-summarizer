Theyll start things off with a small Supercon update, and go right into fusion reactors, AI surgeons, planned obsolescence, and robotic cats and dogs. Theyll also go over several entries from the ongoing 2025 One Hertz Challenge, an ambitious flight simulator restoration project, old school lightning detectors, and how Blu-ray won the battle against HD DVD but lost the war against streaming. Stick around to the end to hear an incredible story about a clandestine machine shop in a WWII prisoner of war camp, and the valiant fight to restore communications with the Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and add it to your collection.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 329 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nWendelstein 7-X Sets New Record For The Nuclear Fusion Triple Product\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThink you know that sound?

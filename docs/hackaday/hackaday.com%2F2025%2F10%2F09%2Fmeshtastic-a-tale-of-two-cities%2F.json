The weather here in New Jersey isnt quite so dynamic that theres any great chance the local infrastructure will be knocked offline, and while I do value my privacy as much as any other self-respecting hacker, theres nothing in my chats thats sensitive enough that it needs to be done off the Internet.\nBut damn it, do I want it. The idea that everyday citizens of all walks of life are organizing and building out their own communications network with DIY hardware and open source software is incredibly exciting to me. Its like the best parts of a cyberpunk novel, without all the cybernetic implants, pollution, and over-reaching megacorps. Well, weve got those last two, but you know what I mean.\nMeshtastic maps are never exhaustive, but this gives an idea of node density in Philly versus surrounding area.\nEven though I found the Meshtastic concept appealing, my seemingly infinite backlog of projects kept me from getting involved until relatively recently. It wasnt until I got my hands on the Hacker Pager that my passing interest turned into a full blown obsession. But its perhaps not for the reason you might think. Traveling around to different East Coast events with the device in my bag, it would happily chirp away when within range of Philadelphia or New York, but then fall silent again once I got home. While Id get the occasional notification of a nearby node, my area had nothing like the robust and active mesh networks found in those cities.\nWell, they say you should be the change you want to see in the world, so I decided to do something about it. Obviously I wouldnt be able to build up an entire network by myself, but I figured that if I started standing up some nodes, others might notice and follow suit. It was around this time that Seeed Studio introduced the SenseCAP Solar node, which looked like a good way to get started. So I bought two of them with the idea of putting one on my house and the other on my parents place down the shore.\nThe results werent quite what I expected, but its certainly been an interesting experience so far, and today Im even more eager to build up the mesh than I was in the beginning.\n\nStarting on Easy Mode\nI didnt make a conscious decision to start my experiment at my parents house. Indeed, located some 60 miles (96 km) from where I live, any progress in building out a mesh network over there wouldnt benefit me back home. But it was the beginning of summer, they have a pool, and my daughters love to swim. As such, we spent nearly every weekend there which gave me plenty of time to tinker.\nFor those unfamiliar with New Jerseys Southern Shore area, the coastline itself is dotted with vacation spots such as Wildwood, Atlantic City, and Long Beach Island. This is where the tourists go to enjoy the beaches, boardwalks, cotton candy, and expensive rental homes. But move slightly inland, and youll find a marshland permeated with a vast network of bays, creeks, and tributaries. For each body of water large enough to get a boat through, youll find a small town or even an unincorporated community that in the early 1900s would have been bustling with oyster houses and hunting shacks, but today might only be notable for having their own Wawa.\nTo infinity, and beyond.\nMy parents are in one of those towns that doesnt have a Wawa. Its very quiet, the skies are dark, and theres not much more than marsh and water all around. So when I ran the SenseCAP Solar up their 20 foot (6 m) flagpole, which in a former life was actually the mast from a sailing catamaran, the results were extremely impressive.\nI hadnt had the radio up for more than a few hours before my phone pinged with a message. We chatted back and forth a bit, and I found that my new mesh friend was an amateur radio operator living on Long Beach Island, and that he too had just recently started experimenting with Meshtastic. He was also, incidentally, a fan of Hackaday. (Hi, Leon!) He mentioned that his setup was no more advanced than an ESP32 dev board sitting in his window, and yet we were reliably communicating at a range of approximately 6 miles (9 km).\nEncouraged, I decided to leave the radio online all night. In the morning, I was shocked to find it had picked up more than a dozen new nodes. Incredibly, it was even able to sniff out a few nodes that I recognized from Philadelphia, 50 miles (80 km) to the west. I started to wonder if it was possible that I might actually be able to reach my own home, potentially establishing a link clear across the state.\nLater that day, somebody on an airplane fired off a few messages on the way out of Philadelphia International Airport. Seeing the messages was exciting enough, but through the magic of mesh networking, it allowed my node to temporarily see networks at an even greater distance. I picked up one node that was more than 100 miles (160 km) away in Aberdeen, Maryland.\nI was exhilarated by these results, and eager to get back home and install the second SenseCAP Solar node. If these were the kind of results I was getting in the middle of nowhere, surely Id make even more contacts in a dense urban area.\nReality Comes Crashing Home\nYou see, at this point I had convinced myself that the reason I wasnt getting any results back at home was the relatively meager antenna built into the Hacker Pager. Now that I had a proper node with an antenna bigger than my pinkie finger, I was sure Id get better results. Especially since Id be placing the radio even higher this time  with a military surplus fiberglass mast clamped into the old TV antenna mount on my three story house, the node would be around 40 feet (12 m) above the ground.\nThe mast gets my node above the neighbors roofs, but just barely.\nBut when I opened the Meshtastic app the day after getting my home node installed, I was greeted with.nothing. Not a single node was detected in a 24 hour period. This seemed very odd given my experience down the shore, but I brushed it off. After all, Meshtastic nodes only occasionally announce their presence when they arent actively transmitting.\nUndaunted, I made plans with a nearby friend to install a node at his place. His home is just 1.2 miles (1.9 km) from mine, and given the casual 6 mile (9 km) contact I had made at my parents place, it seemed like this would be an easy first leg of our fledgling network.\nYet when we stood up a temporary node in his front yard, messages between it and my house were only occasionally making it through. Worse, the signal strength displayed in the application was abysmal. It was clear that, even at such a short range, an intermediary node would be necessary to get our homes reliably connected.\nAt this point, I was feeling pretty dejected. The incredible results I got when using Meshtastic in the sticks had clearly given me a false sense of what the technology was capable of in an urban environment. To make matters even worse, some further investigation found that my house was about the worst possible place to try and mount a node.\nFor one thing, until I bothered to look it up, I never realized my house was located in a small valley. According to online line-of-sight tools, Im essentially at the bottom of a bowl. As if that wasnt bad enough, I noted that the Meshtastic application was showing an inordinate number of bad packets. After consulting with those more experienced with the project, I now know this to be an indicator of a noisy RF environment. Which may also explain the exceptionally poor reception I get when trying to fly my FPV drone around the neighborhood, but thats a story for another day.\nA More Pragmatic Approach\nWhile I was disappointed that I couldnt replicate my seaside Meshtastic successes at home, Im not discouraged. Ive learned a great deal about the technology, especially its limitations. Besides, the solution is simple enough  we need more nodes, and so the campaign to get nearby friends and family interested in the project has begun. Weve already found another person in a geographically strategic position whos willing to host a node on their roof, and as I write this a third Seeed SenseCAP Solar sits ready for installation.\nAt the same time, the performance of Meshtastic in a more rural setting has inspired me to push further in that region. Im in the process of designing a custom node specifically tailored for the harsh marine environment, and have identified several potential locations where I can deploy them in the Spring. With just a handful of well-placed nodes, I believe it should be possible to cover literally hundreds of square miles.\nIm now fighting a battle on two fronts, but thankfully, Im not alone. In the months since Ive started this project, Ive noticed a steady uptick in the number of detected nodes. Even here at home, Ive finally started to pick up some chatter from nearby nodes. Theres no denying it, the mesh is growing everyday.\nMy advice to anyone looking to get into Meshtastic is simple. Whether youre in the boonies, or stuck in the middle of a metropolis, pick up some compatible hardware, mount it as high as you can manage, and wait. It might not happen overnight, but eventually your device is going to ping with that first message  and thats when the real obsession starts."}

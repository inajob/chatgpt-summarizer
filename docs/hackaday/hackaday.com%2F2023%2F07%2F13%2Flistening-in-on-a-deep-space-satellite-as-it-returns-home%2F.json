Its not too much of a trick to download images straight from our constellation of weather satellites, but what about space weather? Weve got satellites for that too, of course, but to get a good look at the Sun, theyre out of reach of most homebrew ground stations.\nThats about to change, though, as STEREO-A returns to our neighborhood after a 17-year absence, making citizen science a reasonable proposition. The STEREO mission  Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory  was launched in 2006 with a pair of satellites in heliocentric orbits. STEREO-B was lost in 2014 due to a navigational glitch, but STEREO-A has spent a lot of the intervening years watching the backside of the Sun relative to the Earth. As [Scott Tilley] explains, the satellite is now approaching inferior conjunction, where it will pass between the Earth and the Sun.\nThis close pass makes STEREO-As X-band deep-space beacon readily available to hobbyist-scale equipment, like [Scott]s 66-cm dish antenna. The dish is mounted on an alt-az telescope mount for tracking, and sports a host of gear at the focus, like LNAs, filters, mixers, and an Ettus B200 SDR. Its not a cheap setup, but compared to whats usually needed to listen to STEREO-A, its a bargain. The process of demodulating and decoding the signals was a bit more involved, though, requiring not only SatDump and some custom code but also a lot of patience. The images are worth the wait, though; [Scott] shares some amazing shots of our increasingly active Sun as well as animations of recent sunspot activity.\nIf youre interested in getting in on the STEREO-A action, youd better get hopping  the satellite will only be in the neighborhood for a few more months before heading off for another pass around the back of the Sun.", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u4f1a\uff01\u592a\u967d\u306e\u59ff\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u5730\u4e0a\u5c40\u304c\u518d\u3073\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "body": "\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5929\u6c17\u3092\u885b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u76f4\u63a5\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u592a\u967d\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u304c\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5730\u4e0a\u5c40\u3067\u306f\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u300117\u5e74\u3076\u308a\u306bSTREO-A\u304c\u5730\u7403\u306b\u623b\u308a\u3001\u5e02\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002STREO-A\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30d3\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u30db\u30d3\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u6570\u304b\u6708\u3067\u518d\u3073\u592a\u967d\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3092\u56de\u308b\u524d\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u6a5f\u4f1a\uff01\u592a\u967d\u306e\u59ff\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u5730\u4e0a\u5c40\u304c\u518d\u3073\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "STEREO-A\u306e\u5e30\u9084\uff01\u81ea\u5b85\u306e\u8a2d\u5099\u3067\u592a\u967d\u3092\u89b3\u6e2c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "STEREO-A\u306e\u63a5\u8fd1\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30db\u30d3\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u306e\u6a5f\u6750\u3067\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30a6\u30a7\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u89b3\u6e2c\uff01", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u592a\u967d\u306e\u89b3\u6e2c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\uff01STEREO-A\u304c\u518d\u3073\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b", "STEREO-A\u306e\u5229\u7528\u3092\u30a2\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb\uff01\u71b1\u72c2\u7684\u306a\u592a\u967d\u89b3\u6e2c\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01"]}

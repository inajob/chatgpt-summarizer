File systems are easy to do with FUSE, but thats sometimes too high-level. But a block driver can be tough to write and debug, especially since bugs in the kernels space can be catastrophic. [Jiri Pospisil] suggests Ublk, a framework for writing block devices in user space. This works using the io_uring facility in recent kernels.\nThis opens the block device field up. You can use any language you want (weve seen FUSE used with some very strange languages). You can use libraries that would not work in the kernel. Debugging is simple, and crashing is a minor inconvenience.\nAnother advantage? Your driver wont depend on the kernel code. There is a kernel driver, of course, named ublk_drv, but thats not your code. Thats what your code talks to.\n\nThe driver maintains the block devices and relays I/O and ioctl requests to your code for servicing. There are several possible use cases for this. For example, you could dream up some exotic RAID scheme and expose it as a block device that multiplexes many devices. The example in the post, for example, exposes a block device that is made up of many discrete files on a different file system.\nDo you need this? Probably not. But if you do, it is a great way to push out a block driver in a hurry. Is it high-performance? Probably not, just like FUSE isnt as performant as a real file system. But for many cases, thats not a problem.\nIf you want to try FUSE, why not make your favorite website part of your file system?", "title": "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u958b\u767a\uff1aUblk\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "Linux\u7528\u306e\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7a7a\u9593\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308bUblk\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u958b\u767a\uff1aUblk\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- io_uring\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u4f5c\u6210", "- FUSE\u3068Ublk\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u304c\u5bb9\u6613\u306a\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306eRAID\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6307\u5357"]}

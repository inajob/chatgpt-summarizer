But inevitably there are some we dont see, because their builders didnt manage to get them finished in time. [Park Frazer]s phase-locked loop is one of them. The circuit is an all-discrete PLL that derives a 440kHz output from a 1Hz input, and it arrived just too late for our 1Hz contest.\nIf you arent familiar with a phase-locked loop, in this context you can think of them as a programmable frequency multiplier. A voltage-controlled oscillator is locked to an input frequency by comparing the two with a phase detector. Multiplication can be achieved by putting a frequency divider between the oscillator and the phase detector. Its at the same time a complex and easy to understand circuit. In this case, when broken down into a set of multivibrators, it makes sense. The charge pump phase detector is a little different from the XOR gate we were expecting, but as he explains, its better.\nIf PLLs are a mystery, have a look at this video from a [Jeri Ellsworth] and [Bil Herd].", "title": "- \u5b8c\u6210\u9593\u8fd1\u3067\u60dc\u3057\u304f\u3082\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u9593\u306b\u5408\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u7d14\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0PLL\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u9593\u306b\u5408\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305fPLL\u56de\u8def\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002440kHz\u51fa\u529b\u30921Hz\u304b\u3089\u751f\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b8c\u6210\u9593\u8fd1\u3067\u60dc\u3057\u304f\u3082\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u9593\u306b\u5408\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u7d14\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0PLL\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u69d8\u3005\u306a\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30ba\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "- \u96fb\u5727\u5236\u5fa1\u767a\u632f\u5668\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u5358\u7d14\u3055\u3068\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u304c\u5171\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30ba\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u56de\u8def\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "- PLL\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u3092\u6df1\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u52d5\u753b\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

This is effectively what we have been doing ever since the beginning of the Space Age, with an increasing number of rocket stages, satellites and related objects ending their existence as they burn up in the Earths atmosphere. Yet rather than vanish into nothing, the debris of this destruction remains partially in the atmosphere, where it forms pockets of material. As this material is often conductive, it will likely affect the Earths magnetic field, as argued by [Sierra Solter-Hunt] in a pre-publication article.\nA summary by [Dr. Tony Phillips] references a 2023 NASA research article by [Daniel M. Murphy] et al. which describes the discovery that about 10% of the aerosol particles in the stratosphere are aluminium and other metals whose origin can be traced back to the burn-up of the aforementioned space objects. This is a factor which can increase the Debye length of the ionosphere. What the exact effects of this may be is still largely unknown, but fact remains that we are launching massively more objects into space than even a decade ago, with the number of LEO objects consequently increasing.\nAlthough the speculation by [Sierra] can be called alarmist, the research question of whatll happen if over the coming years well have daily Starlink and other satellites disintegrating in the atmosphere is a valid one. As this looks like it will coat the stratosphere and ionosphere in particular with metal aerosols at levels never seen before, it might be worth it to do the research up-front, rather than wait until we see something odd happening.", "title": "\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u71c3\u3048\u5c3d\u304d\u308b\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3084\u885b\u661f\u306e\u7834\u7247\u304c\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\uff01", "body": "\u5b87\u5b99\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3084\u885b\u661f\u306e\u71c3\u713c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u5927\u6c17\u4e2d\u306b\u91d1\u5c5e\u306e\u7834\u7247\u304c\u6563\u3089\u3070\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u304c\u5730\u78c1\u6c17\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u6210\u5c64\u570f\u306b\u306f\u5b87\u5b99\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u71c3\u713c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u306a\u3069\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u306e\u7c92\u5b50\u304c10%\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304cNASA\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3067\u793a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u3053\u306e\u6570\u306f\u5897\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8abf\u67fb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u71c3\u3048\u5c3d\u304d\u308b\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3084\u885b\u661f\u306e\u7834\u7247\u304c\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\uff01", "\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u5927\u6c17\u4e2d\u306b\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u91d1\u5c5e\u306e\u5fae\u7c92\u5b50\u304c\u5730\u7403\u306e\u78c1\u5834\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53ca\u307c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff01", "\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u7834\u7247\u304c\u6210\u3059\u91d1\u5c5e\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30be\u30eb\u304c\u6210\u5c64\u570f\u3068\u96fb\u96e2\u570f\u306b\u84c4\u7a4d\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5224\u660e\uff01", "\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u4e2d\u306b\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u9577\u3055\u304c\u5897\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u8981\u56e0\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\uff01", "\u5927\u6c17\u4e2d\u306b\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u91d1\u5c5e\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30be\u30eb\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u306f\u6025\u52d9\uff01"]}

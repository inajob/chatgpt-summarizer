You have to have a Qualcomm-based device, it has to either run rooted Android or be a USB modem, but once you find one in your drawers, you can get a steady stream of packets straight into your Wireshark window. No more expensive SDR requirement for getting into cellular sniffing  at least, not unless you are debugging some seriously low-level issues.\nIt appears theres a Qualcomm specific diagnostic port you can access over USB, that this software can make use of. The 5G capture support is currently situational, but 2G/3G/4G capabilities seem to be pretty stable. And theres a good few devices in the successfully tested list  given the way this software functions, chances are, your device will work! Remember to report whether it does or doesnt, of course. Also, the project is seriously rich on instructions  whether youre using Linux or Windows, it appears you wont be left alone debugging any problems you might encounter.\nThis is a receive-only project, so, legally, you are most likely allowed to have fun  at least, it would be pretty complicated to detect that you are, unlike with transmit-capable setups. Qualcomm devices have pretty much permeated our lives, with Qualcomm chips nowadays used even in the ever-present SimCom modules, like the modems used in the PinePhone. Wondering what a sniffer could be useful for? Well, for one, if you ever need to debug a 4G base station youve just set up, completely legally, of course."}

But [vhuvanmakes] built Wavy-Scope, a handheld radio telescope that can find the Sun and the Moon, among other things.\nThe build is relatively straightforward, using a commercial LNB to detect signals in the 10-12 GHz range. The detector is a simple satellite finder, although you could also connect it to a software-defined radio, if you wanted something more sophisticated.\n\nThe sci-fi style unit is 3D printed, of course, and made us think of a 1950s-era ray gun. There are several videos of the device in action, including one of it detecting the sun that you can see below.\nOne of the videos shows the instrument detecting otherwise invisible satellites. Of course, it will also detect anything that emits sufficient RF energy for the LNA to detect. When you arent using it to snoop on the sky, it would make a fair addition to your Halloween costume.\nWeve seen small radio telescopes before, but not this small. You probably wont be tracking down hydrogen lines with this, but it could still be a lot of fun.\n", "title": "- \u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u300cWavy-Scope\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u624b\u6301\u3061\u578b\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u300cWavy-Scope\u300d\u306f\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u592a\u967d\u3084\u6708\u3092\u63a2\u77e5\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u300cWavy-Scope\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff0110-12 GHz\u5e2f\u57df\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u5de5\u885b\u661f\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

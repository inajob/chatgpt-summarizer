If you want to keep it as alive as possible, though, you might like to implement some controls. Thats precisely what [yotitote] did with their smart terrarium build.\nAt the heart of the build is an ESP32 microcontroller. Its armed with temperature and humidity sensors to detect the state of the atmosphere within the terrarium itself. However, its not just a mere monitor. Its able to influence conditions by activating an ultrasonic fogger to increase humidity (which slightly impacts temperature in turn). There are also LED strips, which the ESP32 controls in order to try and aid the growth of plants within, and a small OLED screen to keep an eye on the vital signs.\nIts a simple project, but one that serves as a basic starting point that could be readily expanded as needed. It wouldnt take much to adapt this further, such as by adding heating elements for precise temperature control, or more advanced lighting systems. These could be particularly useful if you intend your terrarium to support, perhaps, reptiles, in addition to tropical plant life.\nIndeed, weve seen similar work before, using a Raspberry Pi to create a positive environment to keep geckos alive! Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own advanced terrarium at home, dont hesitate to let us know."}

The Commodore VIC-20 had no such capability out of the box, but [Mike] was able to get one talking with a little bit of work.\nThe project centers around the Adventureland cartridge, created by Scott Adams (but not the one youre thinking of). It was a simple game that was able to deliver speech with the aid of the Votrax Type and Talk speech synthesizer box. Those arent exactly easy to come by, so [Mike] set about creating a modern equivalent. The concept was simple enough. An Arduino would be used to act as a go between the VIC-20s slow serial port operating at 300 bps and the Speakjet and TTS256 chips which both preferred to talk at 9600 bps. The audio output of the Speakjet is then passed to an LM386 op-amp, set up as an amplifier to drive a small speaker. The lashed-together TTS system basically just reads out the text from the Adventureland game in an incredibly robotic voice. Its relatively hard to understand and has poor cadence, but it does work  in much the same way as the original Type and Talk setup would have back in the day!\nText to speech tools have come a\u00a0long way since the 1980s, particularly when it comes to sounding more natural. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]", "title": "VIC-20\u3092\u558b\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "body": "\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebVIC-20\u304c\u97f3\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30a2\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u51fa\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["VIC-20\u3092\u558b\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "86\u5e74\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cAdventureland\u300d\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u5316\u306b\u6311\u6226  ", "Arduino\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3001VIC-20\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b  ", "Speakjet\u3068TTS256\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0  ", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u97f3\u58f0\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb  "]}

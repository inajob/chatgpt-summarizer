When we miss the mark and make technical errors or stake out a controversial position on something, our readers will certainly let us know in the comments section. Its a love-hate thing.\nWhile we dont always see eye to eye, theres one thing that everyone seems to agree on: Hackadays art is amazing! Our unique look comes down to one man: art director Joe Kim. Joes creations have graced Hackadays pages for years, and his ability to come up with just the right art to illustrate subject matter thats often complicated and abstract never ceases to amaze.\nA lot of you have asked about Hackadays art over the years, so we asked Joe to come on the Hack Chat to talk about the process of creating these mini masterpieces. If youve ever wondered about the art of Hackaday, or just wanted to say thanks for the visual feast, heres your chance.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, May 15 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter."}

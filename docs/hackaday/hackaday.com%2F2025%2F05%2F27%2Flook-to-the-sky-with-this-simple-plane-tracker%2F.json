Worry not! Here is a neat and cheap Arduino/Ras Pi project to keep your neck sore free! [BANK ANGLE] presents a wonderfully simple plane tracking system using an affordable camera and basic microcontrollers.\nThe bulk of the system relies on a cheap rotating security camera that gets dissected to reveal its internals. Here stepper control wires can be found and connected to the control boards required to allow an Arduino nano to tell the motors when and where to spin. Of course, the camera system doesn\u2019t just look everywhere until it finds a plane, a Raspberry Pi takes in data from local ADS-B data to know where a nearby plane is.\nAfter that, all thats left is a nifty overlay to make the professional look. Combining all these creates a surprisingly capable system that gives information on the aircrafts azimuth, elevation, and distance.\nIf you want to try your hand at making your own version of [BLANK ANGLE]\u2019s tracker, check out his GitHub page. Of course, tracking planes gets boring after a while so why not try tracking something higher with this open-source star tracker?\n\n\nThank you Israel Brunini for the tip."}

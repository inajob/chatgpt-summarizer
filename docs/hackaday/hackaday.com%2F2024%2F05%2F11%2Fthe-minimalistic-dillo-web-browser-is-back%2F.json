All but a few, that is.\nDillo is one of a small number of browsers that requires only a minimum of system resources and will happily run on an Intel 486 or thereabouts. Sadly, the project more or less ended back in 2016 when the rendering engines developer passed away, but with the recent 3.10 release the project seems to be back on track, courtesy of efforts by [Rodrigo Arias Mallo].\nAlthough a number of forks were started after the Dillo project ground to a halt, of these only Dillo+ appears to be active at this point in time, making this project revival a welcome boost, as is its porting to Atari systems. As for Dillos feature set, it boasts support for a range of protocols, including Gopher, HTTP(S), Gemini, and FTP via extensions. It supports HTML 4.01 and some HTML 5, along with CSS 2.1 and some CSS 3 features, and of course no JavaScript.\nOn todays JS-crazed web this means access can be somewhat limited, but maybe it will promote websites to have a no-JS fallback for the Dillo users. The source code and releases can be obtained from the GitHub project page, with contributions to the project gracefully accepted.\nThanks to [Prof. Dr. Feinfinger] for the tip.", "title": "\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044 \"Dillo\" \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u8efd\u91cf\u306aHTML\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eCPU\u3084RAM\u3092\u591a\u304f\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3059\u308b\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3078\u306e\u5909\u5316\u304c\u8d77\u3053\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Dillo\u306f\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u3001Intel 486\u306a\u3069\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f2016\u5e74\u306b\u7d42\u4e86\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044 \"Dillo\" \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u4e0d\u673d\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6 \"Dillo\"", "\u8efd\u5feb\u3067\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b \"Dillo\" \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "\"Dillo\" \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c2016\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3059", "\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u52b9\u7387\u306e\u9ad8\u3044 \"Dillo\" \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

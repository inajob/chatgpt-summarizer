Its not a terribly long read, but while it does get technical there are also car analogies, so theres something for everyone!\nHe starts off by saying that most people know that GPUs are scarily efficient at matrix multiplication and convolution, but what really makes them most useful is their ability to work with large amounts of memory very efficiently.\nEssentially, a CPU is a latency-optimized device while GPUs are bandwidth-optimized devices. If a CPU is a race car, a GPU is a cargo truck. The main job in deep learning is to fetch and move cargo (memory, actually) around. Both devices can do this job, but in different ways. A race car moves quickly, but cant carry much. A truck is slower, but far better at moving a lot at once.\nTo extend the analogy, a GPU isnt actually just a truck; it is more like a fleet of trucks working in parallel. When applied correctly, this can effectively hide latency in much the same way as an assembly line. It takes a while for the first truck to arrive, but once it does, theres an unbroken line of loaded trucks waiting to be unloaded. No matter how quickly and efficiently one unloads each truck, the next one is right there, waiting. Of course, GPUs dont just shuttle memory around, they can do work on it as well.\nThe usual configuration for deep learning applications is a desktop computer with one or more high-end graphics cards wedged into it, but there are other (and smaller) ways to enjoy some of the same computational advantages without eating a ton of power and gaining a bunch of unused extra HDMI and DisplayPort jacks as a side effect. NVIDIAs line of Jetson development boards incorporates the right technology in an integrated way. While it might lack the raw horsepower (and power bill) of a desktop machine laden with GPUs, theyre no slouch for their size.", "title": "GPU\u3068CPU\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u5927\u91cf\u8f38\u9001\u304c\u5f97\u610f\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af", "body": "GPU\u306f\u884c\u5217\u6f14\u7b97\u3084\u7573\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3067\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u9023\u643a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u305d\u306e\u6709\u7528\u6027\u306e\u80cc\u666f\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3002CPU\u306f\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3057\u305f\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4e00\u65b9GPU\u306f\u5e2f\u57df\u5e45\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3057\u305f\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u306f\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e3b\u306a\u4efb\u52d9\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001GPU\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4e26\u5217\u306b\u51e6\u7406\u3059\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u3092\u96a0\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3068\u306a\u308b\u3002\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC\u306b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3060\u304c\u3001NVIDIA\u306eJetson\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u306e\u8a08\u7b97\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u4eab\u53d7\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["GPU\u3068CPU\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u5927\u91cf\u8f38\u9001\u304c\u5f97\u610f\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af", "GPU\u306e\u5f79\u5272\uff1a\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u30fb\u51e6\u7406\u3059\u308b", "GPU\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u52b9\u679c\uff1a\u9023\u7d9a\u3057\u3066\u5230\u7740\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5f85\u3061\u6642\u9593\u3092\u306a\u304f\u3059", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306aJetson\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7PC\u4ee5\u5916\u3067\u3082\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aJetson\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528"]}

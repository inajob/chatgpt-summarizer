The answer is yes!\nTrue, this small clone is limited to playing with blocks in a world that measures only 9x9x9, but the fact that [Benjamin Aster] managed it at all using only CSS and pure HTML is a fantastic achievement. As far as proofs of concept go, its a pretty clever one.\nThe project consists of roughly 40,000 lines of HTML radio buttons and labels, combined with fewer than 500 lines of CSS where the real work is done. In a short thread on X [Benjamin] explains that each block in the 9x9x9 world is defined with the help of tens of thousands of label and input type=\"radio\" elements to track block types and faces, and CSS uses that as a type of display filter. Clicking a block is clicking a label, and changing a block type (air or no block is considered a type of block) switches which labels are visible to the user.\nViewing in 3D is implemented via CSS animations which apply transforms to what is displayed. Clicking a control starts and stops the animation, resulting in a view change. Its a lot of atypical functionality for plain HTML and CSS, showing what is possible with a bit of out-of-the-box thinking.\n[Simon Willison] has a more in-depth analysis of CSS-Minecraft and how it works, and the code is on GitHub if you want a closer look.\nOnce youre done checking that out and hungry for more cleverness, dont miss Minecraft in COBOL and Minecraft Running in Minecraft."}

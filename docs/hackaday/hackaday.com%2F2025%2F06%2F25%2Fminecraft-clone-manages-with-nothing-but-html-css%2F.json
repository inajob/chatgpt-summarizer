The answer is yes!\nTrue, this small clone is limited to playing with blocks in a world that measures only 9x9x9, but the fact that [Benjamin Aster] managed it at all using only CSS and pure HTML is a fantastic achievement. As far as proofs of concept go, its a pretty clever one.\nThe project consists of roughly 40,000 lines of HTML radio buttons and labels, combined with fewer than 500 lines of CSS where the real work is done. In a short thread on X [Benjamin] explains that each block in the 9x9x9 world is defined with the help of tens of thousands of label and input type=\"radio\" elements to track block types and faces, and CSS uses that as a type of display filter. Clicking a block is clicking a label, and changing a block type (air or no block is considered a type of block) switches which labels are visible to the user.\nViewing in 3D is implemented via CSS animations which apply transforms to what is displayed. Clicking a control starts and stops the animation, resulting in a view change. Its a lot of atypical functionality for plain HTML and CSS, showing what is possible with a bit of out-of-the-box thinking.\n[Simon Willison] has a more in-depth analysis of CSS-Minecraft and how it works, and the code is on GitHub if you want a closer look.\nOnce youre done checking that out and hungry for more cleverness, dont miss Minecraft in COBOL and Minecraft Running in Minecraft.", "title": "- CSS\u3068HTML\u3060\u3051\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b3D\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "CSS\u3068HTML\u3060\u3051\u30673D\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3002\u7d044\u4e07\u884c\u306eHTML\u3068500\u884c\u306eCSS\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- CSS\u3068HTML\u3060\u3051\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b3D\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- JavaScript\u306a\u3057\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f9x9x9\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3", "- 4\u4e07\u884c\u306eHTML\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01CSS\u306b\u3088\u308b\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u8868\u73fe", "- HTML\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u6e80\u8f09\uff01CSS\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u30803D\u8868\u793a"]}

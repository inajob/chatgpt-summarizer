There are precious few analog broadcasters left in the world and black and white isnt that fun to watch, anyway. However, with a little work, you could repurpose that old tube as a clock, as [mircemk] demonstrates.\nThe build is based around an Arduino Nano R3. This isnt a particularly powerful microcontroller board, but its good enough to run the classic TVOut library. This library lets you generate composite video on an Atmel AVR microcontroller with an absolute minimum of supporting circuitry. [mircemk] paired the Arduino with a DS3231 real-time clock, and whipped up code to display the time and date on the composite video output. He then also demonstrates how to hack the signal into an old TV that doesnt have a specific input for composite signals.\nYoull note the headline says any old TV can be a clock, and thats for good reason. Newer TVs tend to eschew the classic composite video input, so the TVOut library wont be any good if youre trying to get a display up on your modern-era flatscreen. In any case, weve seen the TVOut library put to good use before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

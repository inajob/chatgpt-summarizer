All that was left was a discussion of modifying it for conventional roll film, or perhaps hacking a modern back-to-front Polaroid sheet into it.\nNever say never though, because along come the Chinese company Light Lens Lab with a short announcement at the end of a post talking about grain structures and anti-halation layer materials for their black and white film.\nLastly, with our future development plan, we are currently developing and researching instant peel-apart film, with plans on producing and making available black and white peel-apart film by 2025 in various format. We aim to have an update on our packaging and test shot for the next development/research progress installment. We are also researching, developing and producing colour reversal films that consist of a dye-incorporating development process, commonly known as K-14, for 135 and 120 formats in 2026.\nSo there you go, no sooner has Hackaday declared a format unavailable, than it shows every sign of reappearing. At this point wed like to take the opportunity to report that McDonalds Szechuan Chicken McNugget sauce will never ever be available again.\nSo what does this mean? First of all, assuming that the stuff doesnt need the GDP of a small country to buy in Europe, the Hackaday Polaroid 104 will be able to shoot in its native format again. But perhaps more interestingly, it opens up a new option for the camera hacker. Pack film is much easier than modern instant film to deal with; it requires only rollers and someone to tug on that paper tab, no gears or motors involved. Were here for this.\nThe observant will also have noted at the end of the announcement, mention of a dye-incorporating development process. This refers to the colour chemistry seen in Kodachrome, a long-extinct single-layer film that offered legendarily sharp and vibrant-coloured pictures at the expense of a very complex development path. Wed love to see it, but well take the instant pack film and run.\nThe Hackaday Land camera is here.", "title": "\u30dd\u30e9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u672a\u6765: \u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "body": "\u30dd\u30e9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u7528\u306e\u77ac\u9593\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u304c\u518d\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u30012025\u5e74\u306b\u306f\u767d\u9ed2\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30e9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u672a\u6765: \u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f01\u696dLight Lens Lab\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u578b\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0", "2025\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u4e88\u5b9a\u306e\u767d\u9ed2\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2: \u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u5e7b\u306e\u30b3\u30c0\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30e0\u518d\u6765\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u9032\u5316"]}

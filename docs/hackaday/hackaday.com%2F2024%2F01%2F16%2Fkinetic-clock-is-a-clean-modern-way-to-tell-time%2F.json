They tend to prefer building altogether more arcane and complicated contraptions to display numbers for the telling of time. [alstroemeria] did just that with this nifty kinetic clock build.\nThe basic concept of the kinetic clock is to have a flat plate, which individual segments raise out of to create a physical (instead of illuminated) 7-segment display. This is achieved with servos which push the segments in and out using a small rack mechanism. Its not a sophisticated build; it simply uses 30 servos to handle all the segments needed to tell time. Thus, the Arduino Mega was the perfect tool for the job. With a sensor shield added on, it has an abundance of IO, driving a ton of servos is a cinch. Theres also a DS3231 real time clock to help it keep accurate time.\nIncidentally, its a hefty thing to print, according to YouTuber [Lukas Deem] who replicated the project. It took around 85 hours to print, and a total of 655 grams of filament  not counting mistakes and trashed parts.\nAnd if you think youre having deja-vu, you might well be. Weve seen a take on this exquisite design before. We liked it then, and we like it now.\nOverall, its a stylish build that looks as good as your 3D printers output will allow. A resin printer would be a massive boon in this regard. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

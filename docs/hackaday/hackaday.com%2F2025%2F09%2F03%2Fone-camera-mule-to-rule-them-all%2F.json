[Jenny List]s 7 touchscreen camera enclosure is just such a mule.\nIn this case, the hardware to be evaluated is camera modules shes starting out with the official RPi HQ camera, but the modular nature of the construction means its easy to swap modules for evaluation. The camera modules live on 3D printed front plates held to the similarly-printed body with self-tapping screws.\nAny Pi will do, though depending on the camera module you may need one of the newer versions. [Jenny] has got Pi4 inside, which ought to handle anything. For control and preview, [Jenny] is using an old first-gen 7 touchscreen from the Raspberry Pi foundation. Those were nice little screens back in the day, and they still serve well now.\nTheres no provision for a battery because [Jenny] doesnt need one this isnt a working camera, after all, its just a test mule for the sensors. Having it tethered to a wall wart or power bank is no problem in this application. All files are on GitHub under a CC4.0 license not just STLs, either, proper CAD files that you can actually make your own. (SCAD files in this case, but who doesnt love OpenSCAD?) That means if you love the look of this thing and want to squeeze in a battery or add a tripod mount, you can!\u00a0Its no shock that our own [Jenny List] would follow best-practice for open source hardware, but its so few people do that its worth calling out when we see it.\nThanks to [Jenny] for the tip, and dont forget that the tip line is open to everyone, and everyone is equally welcome to toot their own horn.", "title": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u300c\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u30b8\u30e3\u30cb\u2015\u30fb\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u8a55\u4fa1\u7528\u306e\u7b50\u4f53\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u300c\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u8a55\u4fa1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u3092\u5b9f\u8df5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aCAD\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u516c\u958b\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

If that makes you think of Muppets, this video will change your mind. In a behind-the-scenes look with [Adam Savage], effects designer [Mark Setrakian] reveals the full animatronic glory of Mr. Winks mechanical fist from Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)  and this beast still flexes.\nMost of this arm was actually made in 2003, when 3D printing was very different than what we think of today. Printed on a Stratasys Titan  think: large refrigerator-sized machine, expensive as sin  the parts were then hand-textured with a Dremel for that war-scarred, brutalist feel. This wasnt just basic animatronics for set dressing. This was a fully actuated prop with servo-driven finger joints, a retractable chain weapon, and bevel-geared mechanisms that scream mechanical craftsmanship.\nEach finger is individually designed. The chain reel: powered by a DeWalt drill motor and custom bevel gear assembly. Every department: sculptors, CAD modelers, machinists, contributed to this hybrid of analog and digital magic. Props like this are becoming unicorns.\n\n"}

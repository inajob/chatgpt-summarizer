But there was one piece missing: MIDI. [Joren] didnt let that stop him, and successfully created hardware to allow MIDI input and output.\nThe new panel provides all the connectors necessary to interface with either classic MIDI devices, or MIDI over USB (where it appears as a USB MIDI device to any modern OS.)\nInterestingly, the soundcard for the NeXTcube has an RS-422 serial port and some 8-pin mini DIN connectors. They are not compatible with standard MIDI signals, but theyre not far off, either.\nTo solve this, [Joren] used a Teensy developer board to act as an interface between classic MIDI devices like keyboards or synthesizers (or even not-so-common ones like this strange instrument) while also being able to accommodate modern MIDI over USB connections thanks to the Teensys USB MIDI functionality.\nA metal enclosure with a 3D-printed panel rounds out the device, restoring a critical piece of functionality to the electronic music-oriented workstation.\nMIDI as a protocol isnt technically limited to musical applications, though thats one place it shines. And just in case it comes in handy someday, you can send MIDI over I2C if you really need to."}

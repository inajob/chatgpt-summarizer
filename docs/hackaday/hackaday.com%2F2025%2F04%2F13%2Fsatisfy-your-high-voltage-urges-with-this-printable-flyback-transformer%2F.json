Never fear; if youre careful, a 3D-printed flyback might be just the thing youre looking for.\nTo be fair, its pretty easy to come by new flyback transformers, so building your own isnt strictly necessary. But\u00a0[SciTubeHD] was in the market for a particularly large flyback, in a good-natured effort to displace [Jay Bowles] from his lofty perch atop the flyback heap. And its also true that this project isnt entirely 3D-printed, as the split core of the transformer was sourced commercially. The secondary coil, though, was where most of the effort went, with a secondary form made from multiple snap-together discs epoxied together for good measure. The secondary has about a kilometer of 30-gauge magnet wire while the primary holds just ten turns of 8-gauge wire covered with silicone high-voltage insulation.\nTo decrease the likelihood of arcing, the transformer was placed in a plastic container filled with enough mineral oil liquid dielectric to cover the secondary. After degassing in a vacuum chamber for a day, [SciTubeHD] hooked the primary to a couple of different but equally formidable-looking full-bridge inverters for testing. The coil was capable of some pretty spicy arcs  [SciTubeHD] measured 20 amps draw at 35 volts AC input, so this thing isnt to be trifled with. STL files for the core parts are coming up soon; we trust schematics for the power supply will be available, too.\n\n"}

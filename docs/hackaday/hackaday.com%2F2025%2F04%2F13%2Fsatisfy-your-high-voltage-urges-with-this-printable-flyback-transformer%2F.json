Never fear; if youre careful, a 3D-printed flyback might be just the thing youre looking for.\nTo be fair, its pretty easy to come by new flyback transformers, so building your own isnt strictly necessary. But\u00a0[SciTubeHD] was in the market for a particularly large flyback, in a good-natured effort to displace [Jay Bowles] from his lofty perch atop the flyback heap. And its also true that this project isnt entirely 3D-printed, as the split core of the transformer was sourced commercially. The secondary coil, though, was where most of the effort went, with a secondary form made from multiple snap-together discs epoxied together for good measure. The secondary has about a kilometer of 30-gauge magnet wire while the primary holds just ten turns of 8-gauge wire covered with silicone high-voltage insulation.\nTo decrease the likelihood of arcing, the transformer was placed in a plastic container filled with enough mineral oil liquid dielectric to cover the secondary. After degassing in a vacuum chamber for a day, [SciTubeHD] hooked the primary to a couple of different but equally formidable-looking full-bridge inverters for testing. The coil was capable of some pretty spicy arcs  [SciTubeHD] measured 20 amps draw at 35 volts AC input, so this thing isnt to be trifled with. STL files for the core parts are coming up soon; we trust schematics for the power supply will be available, too.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u7528\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30fc", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u8a66\u9a13\u306b\u3082\u6210\u529f\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u7528\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30fc", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u7279\u5927\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u96fb\u6e90\u56de\u8def\u56f3\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3001DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4e00\u624b"]}

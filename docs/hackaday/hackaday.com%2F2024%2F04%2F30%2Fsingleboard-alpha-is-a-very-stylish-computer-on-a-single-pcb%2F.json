But Arduboy creator [Kevin Bates] has recently come up with his own take on the SBC thats a bit like a modernized take on the early computers of the 1980s. Introducing Singleboard: Alpha.\nThe build has an incredibly pleasing form factor  its a single PCB with a capacitive keyboard etched right into the copper. The brains of the Singleboard is an ESP32, which provides plenty of grunt as well as wireless connectivity. Display is via a small LCD, currently configured with a green-on-black terminal that looks fantastic.\nYoure not gonna run a fully-fledged GUI operating system on this thing, but that doesnt mean it cant be useful. We could imagine a device like this being a flexible wireless terminal for working with headless systems, for example, and it would be a charming one at that.\n\n", "title": "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u72481980\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc: Singleboard: Alpha", "body": "Arduboy\u306e\u4f5c\u8005\u3067\u3042\u308bKevin Bates\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cSingleboard: Alpha\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002ESP32\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u30011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306b\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u72481980\u5e74\u4ee3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc: Singleboard: Alpha", "ESP32\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u4ed8\u304d\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30ebPCB", "\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306eSingleboard", "\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u7528\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb: Singleboard"]}

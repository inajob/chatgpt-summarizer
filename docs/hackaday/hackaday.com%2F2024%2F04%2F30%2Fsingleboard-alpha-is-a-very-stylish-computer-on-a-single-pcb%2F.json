But Arduboy creator [Kevin Bates] has recently come up with his own take on the SBC thats a bit like a modernized take on the early computers of the 1980s. Introducing Singleboard: Alpha.\nThe build has an incredibly pleasing form factor  its a single PCB with a capacitive keyboard etched right into the copper. The brains of the Singleboard is an ESP32, which provides plenty of grunt as well as wireless connectivity. Display is via a small LCD, currently configured with a green-on-black terminal that looks fantastic.\nYoure not gonna run a fully-fledged GUI operating system on this thing, but that doesnt mean it cant be useful. We could imagine a device like this being a flexible wireless terminal for working with headless systems, for example, and it would be a charming one at that.\n\n"}

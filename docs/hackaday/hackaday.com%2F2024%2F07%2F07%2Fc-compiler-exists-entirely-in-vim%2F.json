Is it small? It sure is! How about fast? Absolutely not! Efficient? Also no. But does it work and is it neat? You betcha!\nEver typed :wq to write the buffer and exit in Vim? When you do that, youre using Vimscript. Whenever one enters command mode : in Vim, one is in fact using a live Vimscript interpreter. Thats the space in which this project exists and does its magic. Given enough time, anyway.\nVimscript itself was created by [Bram Moolenaar] in 1991. The idea was to execute batches of vim commands programmatically. Its been used for a variety of purposes since then.\n8cc is a lightweight C compiler that has been supplanted by chibicc, but that doesnt matter much because as author [rhysd] admits, this is really just a fun concept project more than anything. It may take twenty minutes or more to compile hello world, but doing it entirely from within Vim is a trip."}

Is it small? It sure is! How about fast? Absolutely not! Efficient? Also no. But does it work and is it neat? You betcha!\nEver typed :wq to write the buffer and exit in Vim? When you do that, youre using Vimscript. Whenever one enters command mode : in Vim, one is in fact using a live Vimscript interpreter. Thats the space in which this project exists and does its magic. Given enough time, anyway.\nVimscript itself was created by [Bram Moolenaar] in 1991. The idea was to execute batches of vim commands programmatically. Its been used for a variety of purposes since then.\n8cc is a lightweight C compiler that has been supplanted by chibicc, but that doesnt matter much because as author [rhysd] admits, this is really just a fun concept project more than anything. It may take twenty minutes or more to compile hello world, but doing it entirely from within Vim is a trip.", "title": "8cc.vim: Vimscript\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u8efd\u91cf\u306aC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9", "body": "8cc.vim\u306f\u3001Vimscript\u3067\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308bC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u3067\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u3082\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u3001\u6574\u7136\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Vim\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067:\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3059\u308b\u3068Vimscript\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u30018cc\u306f\u305d\u306e\u9818\u57df\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u306f\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3044\u6982\u5ff5\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3068\u8ff0\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["8cc.vim: Vimscript\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u8efd\u91cf\u306aC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9", "Vimscript\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305fC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e98cc.vim", "Vimscript\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: 8cc.vim", "8cc.vim: Vimscript\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8efd\u91cfC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9", "chibicc\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u3089\u308c\u305f\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: 8cc.vim"]}

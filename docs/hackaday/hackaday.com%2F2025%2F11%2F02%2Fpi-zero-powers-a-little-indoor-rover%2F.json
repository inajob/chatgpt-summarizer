Sometimes, you can build something fun thats better sized for exploring your tabletop rather than the wastelands of Mars. To that end, [philosiraptor] built the diminutive PITANK rover.\nAs you might guess from the name, the rover is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2. It uses the GPIO pins to output PWM signals, commanding a pair of servos that drive the tracks on either side of the bot. The drivetrain and chassis are made from 3D-printed components. Controlling the robot is handled via a web interface, which [philosiraptor] coded in C# to be as responsive as possible. So you can see where youre driving, the bot is also kitted out with a camera to provide a live video feed.\nGiven its low ground clearance and diminutive size, youre not going to go on big outdoor adventures with PITANK. However, if you wish to explore a nice flat indoor environment, its simple tracked drivetrain should do nicely.\u00a0Weve featured a great many rovers over the years; if youve got a particularly special one, dont hesitate to notify the tipsline!", "title": "\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u63a2\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPITANK\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u5c0f\u578b\u306ePITANK\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306f\u3001Raspberry Pi Zero 2\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u305f\u5353\u4e0a\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u63a2\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPITANK\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Raspberry Pi Zero 2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPITANK\u300d", "C#\u3067\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u5fa1", "\u5ba4\u5185\u63a2\u7d22\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aPITANK\u306e\u7279\u9577\u3068\u6027\u80fd"]}

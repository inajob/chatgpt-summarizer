Its solid, with firm land underfoot. Its able to hang on to a little atmosphere, which is more than you can say about the moon. Its even got a day/night cycle remarkably close to our own. The only problem is its too darn cold, and theres not a lot of oxygen to breathe, either.\nTerraforming is the concept of fixing problems like these on a planet-wide scale. Forget living in domes\u2014lets just make the whole thing habitable!\nThats a huge task, so much current work involves exploring just what we could achieve with todays technology. In the case of Mars, [Casey Handmer] doesnt have a plan to terraform the whole planet. But he does suggest we could potentially achieve significant warming of the Red Planet for $10 billion in just 10 years.\nGiga-Scale Production\nMars actually looks pretty livable in photos, but youd die if you were standing there in the open.

Instead, the idea is first to warm Mars up significantly and release additional carbon dioxide. The hope is that this would help create a warmer blanket around the planet as a starting point for further terraforming works. His plan involves no nuclear reactors, chemical seeding, or big mining operations. Instead, its about maximising the amount of heat pumped into Mars for the lowest cost.\nThe concept is simple. By increasing the amount of sunlight falling on to Mars, its temperature can be increased significantly. That additional warmth would ideally release CO2 from cold storage in carbonate deposits already on\u00a0 Mars. This would further accelerate warming just as it does on Earth via the Greenhouse effect. Ideally, pump enough heat in initially to get that CO2 into the atmosphere, and our favorite greenhouse gas might just do the rest.\nTo get more sunlight on Mars, Handmer proposes using solar sails. Not just one, or two, or a hundred, but solar sails in their billions. They would use light from the sun to travel from Earth to Mars on a timescale of months. When arriving at Mars, they would be stationed at the Sun-Mars L2 Lagrange point, where the required orbital corrections would be at a minimum. From that point, the solar cells would position themselves to reflect sunlight on to the Martian surface to provide heating.\nThe Martian atmosphere is made up of 95.32% carbon dioxide, 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and just 0.13% oxygen. Atmospheric pressure is just 6.35 millibar, compared to 1013 millibar on Earth. That very thin atmosphere nonetheless gives Mars a nice tan sky.\u00a0\nThe sun already provides energy on the level of roughly 600 watts per square meter on the Martian surface. That sums up to about 21,600 terawatts across the entire planet. Compare that to the 8 gigawatts or so put out by our largest nuclear reactor, and its easy to see the sun is providing a lot more energy than we could hope to achieve with any kind of operation on the Martian surface. Reflect more of that sun, and that number goes up nicely.\nLarge solar sails placed opposite the Sun and Mars could be used to increase the amount of solar radiation falling on the red planet. Credit: Casey Handmer\nHandmer notes that a reflector covering 1,000 square meters would reflect 600 kW of sunlight towards Mars. 1,000 sails of this size would effectively add a square kilometer of surface to Marss existing cross-sectional area of 36,000,000 square kilometers. Thats not really a whole lot.\nAs mentioned above, the key is to scale into the billions. The idea is that these simple solar sails could be manufactured on the cheap. Handmer posits that a 1,000 gram sail craft could cover the aforementioned 1,000 square meters. He estimates a production cost on the order of $100, roughly equivalent to a modern cellphone. For electronics, the sail would need a processor, a telemetry radio, a small solar panel, and a camera to act as a star tracker for navigation. It would then use LCD panels to act as reflectively-variable elements to change its direction under the influence of the sun. At that weight, launch costs would be around $2000. Add that on to the manufacturing cost, and youve got 1,000 square meters of Mars reflector for just $2100. Advances could shave manufacturing costs and weight down further, slashing launch costs which are heavily weight dependent.\nAfter launching cheap solar sails high enough into Earth orbit, they would use light pressure from the sun to make their way to the Sun-Mars L2 point. Handmer believes such craft could be built as cheaply as $100 in grand numbers. Credit: Casey Handmer\nIf these solar sails could be manufactured with the same efficiency we churn out smartphones, we could churn out hundreds of millions of these craft in a few years. Handmer suggests a decade of launches could net 1.5 billion sails in position around Mars, which would be good enough for increasing energy input to the planet by 4%. In turn, Mars thermal radiation would have to increase by 4% to balance this extra energy input, which suggests its basic temperature would rise from 210 K to 212 K\u2014or roughly -61.15 Celsius.\u00a0 He costs all this out at around $10 billion, which sounds awfully cheap in the grand scheme of things.\nWorth It?\nOkay, so that still sounds terribly cold. And it is! But that rise of two degrees isnt to be sniffed at. As Handmer points out, thats more than weve achieved here on Earth in 250 years of rampant fossil fuel use.\u00a0 He also notes that the shining solar sails would make for a brilliant view from Marss surface, though its perhaps unlikely many humans would be there to see it, at such cold temperatures.\nFurther gains could be made with some strategy. If cold deposits of stored carbon dioxide were spotted on the surface, the sail network could ideally be aimed to some degree to prioritize warming of those areas first. Done right, this could speed temperature rises on Mars quite significantly.\nReality Check\nThe higher escape velocity of heavier planets allows them to hold on to an atmosphere more easily. Lower temperatures are a boost, too. If we warmed Mars to Earths temperature, its atmosphere would lose oxygen and nitrogen more quickly than it already does.\u00a0 We could end up giving Mars an atmosphere only to lose it in short order.

Theres little will to terraform Mars right now, given we havent even sent a human over for look just yet.\nFurthermore, even if Mars was warmed significantly, theres still the question of whether the atmosphere and environment could be made livable. Humans need oxygen, and we like a certain atmospheric pressure and lots of water. Getting Mars into the right ball park on all these measures would be tough, and maintaining it would involve countering the effects of the solar wind, which has stripped the planets atmosphere in the past.\nThe plan also glosses over some finer points of the engineering required. Its one thing to build 1.5 billion solar sails, and another thing entirely to launch them all and get them to Mars. Once there, theyd need to be very well organized to avoid crashing into each other and turning into one big tangled blob in orbit.\nHandmer has put together a very compelling plan to warm Mars, and to do it on the cheap. Whether it would work is an open question, but this is the kind of wide-ranged blue-sky thinking thats required to solve the space-based problems of tomorrow. Terraforming an entire planet isnt something you do on the small scale; its something that requires the massed industrial outputs of entire societies. Thats a lesson we must learn, not just on Mars, but on Earth.\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u5bb6\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u706b\u661f\uff1a\u60d1\u661f\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u5c45\u4f4f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u706b\u661f\u306f\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u4eba\u985e\u306e\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u3068\u3057\u3066\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002\u56fa\u3044\u5730\u9762\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u6708\u3088\u308a\u306f\u308b\u304b\u306b\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u5bd2\u3055\u3084\u9178\u7d20\u4e0d\u8db3\u304c\u8ab2\u984c\u3002\u624b\u9806\u306f\u30de\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u6e29\u6696\u5316\u3057\u3001\u5730\u7403\u3068\u4f3c\u305f\u5883\u754c\u7dda\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002 QStringLiteral\u306e\u8cbb\u7528\u306f100\u5104\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u672a\u6765\u306e\u5bb6\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u706b\u661f\uff1a\u60d1\u661f\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u5c45\u4f4f\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b", "\u706b\u661f\u306e\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5\u8a08\u753b\uff1a10\u5e74\u9593\u3067100\u5104\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u6696\u304b\u3055\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059", "\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u751f\u7523\uff1a\u706b\u661f\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u592a\u967d\u5e06", "\u706b\u661f\u306e\u5927\u6c17\u3068\u6c17\u6e29\uff1a\u4f4e\u3044\u5927\u6c17\u5727\u3068\u6c37\u306e\u5730\u9762", "\u706b\u661f\u306e\u6e29\u6696\u5316\uff1a\u6570\u5341\u5104\u306e\u592a\u967d\u5e06\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5"]}

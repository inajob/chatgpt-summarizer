If youre coming to Supercon, and youre interested, go get your workshop ticket before they all sell out!\nThere will be a change to this years workshop ticket limits. We heard our communitys feedback, and in the spirit of giving as many people as possible the opportunity to enjoy a workshop, we are limiting sign up to one workshop per attendee. If there are extra tickets by October 18th, we will allow folks to sign up for additional workshops.\nIf you register for more than one workshop we will refund you the ticket for the others based on the timestamp that you registered for each ticket (leaving only the ticket for the first workshop you registered for). We hope everyone understands our goal is to allow more people to experience a Supercon workshop due to limited space.\nAnd of course, you cant join in the workshops at Supercon without coming to Supercon. So get your tickets now if you havent already.\nStay tuned tomorrow for more speaker announcements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam McCombs and Isabel Burgos\nHands on with an Electron Microscope\nPrice: $40.00\nThis workshop will teach you how to become an electron microscope knob turner, starting with basic principles and which fields you are actually manipulating in the column.

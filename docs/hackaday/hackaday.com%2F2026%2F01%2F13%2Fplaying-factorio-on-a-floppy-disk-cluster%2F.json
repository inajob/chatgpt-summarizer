Though high failure rates and slow speeds are an issue, for this project, the key issue is capacity. Thats because [DocJades] goal is playing the video game Factorio off floppy disks.\u00a0\nStoring several gigabytes of data on floppy disks is a rather daunting challenge. But instead of using a RAID array, only a single reader and a custom file system is deployed in this setup. A single disk is dedicated to storing pool information allowing for caching of file locations, reducing disk swaps. The file system can also store single files across multiple disks for storage of larger files. Everything mounts in fuse and is loosely POSIX compliment, but lacks some features like permissions and links.\nWith the data stored across thousands of disks, the user is prompted to insert a new disk when needed. This ends up being the limiting factor in read and write speeds, rather than the famously slow speeds of floppies. In fact, it takes about a week to load all of Factorio in this manner, even after optimizations to reduce disk swaps. Factorio is also one of the few games that could be installed in this manner, as it loads most of the game into memory at launch. Many other games that dynamically load textures and world maps would simply crash when a chunk is not immediately available.\nNot a Factorio\u00a0fan? No worries, you could always install modern Linux on a floppy!\n\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067Factorio\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0Factorio\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226\u3002\u5bb9\u91cf\u554f\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u51e6\u3057\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3067Factorio\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u9650\u754c\uff1a\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5229\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5bb9\u91cf\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306bLinux\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

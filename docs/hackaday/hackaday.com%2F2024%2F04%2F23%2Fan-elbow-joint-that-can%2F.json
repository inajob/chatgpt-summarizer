The motive power comes from a brushless motor, which is what gives the build that impressive small size. Hes posted a YouTube short showing its internals and it doing a small amount of weight lifting, so it evidently has some pulling power.\nIf youre interested in working with this design, it can be downloaded for 3D printing from Thingiverse. We think it could find an application in plenty of other projects, and wed be interested to see what people do with it. Theres certainly a comparison to be maid over robotic joints which use wires for actuation.\n\n"}

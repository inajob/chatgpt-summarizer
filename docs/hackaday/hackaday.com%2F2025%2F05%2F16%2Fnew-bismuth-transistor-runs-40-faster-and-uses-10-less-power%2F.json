Before we tell you about this transistor made from bismuth heres a whirlwind tour of the history of the transistor.\nThe Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT, such as NPN and PNP) was invented by Bell Labs in 1947. Later came Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) made with BJTs. The problem with TTL was too much power consumption.\n\nEnter the energy-efficient Field-Effect Transistor (FET). The FET is better suited to processing information as it is voltage-controlled, unlike the BJT which is current-controlled. Advantages of FETs include high input impedance, low power consumption, fast switching speed, being well suited to Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), etc.\nThe cornerstone of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology which came to replace TTL was a type of FET known as the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET). The type of MOSFET most commonly used in CMOS integrated circuits is the Enhancement-mode MOSFET which is normally off and needs gate voltage to conduct.\nA transistors technology generation is given with the process node, in nanometers (nm). This used to mean the size of the smallest feature that could be fabricated, but these days its just a marketing term (smaller is better). Planar CMOS MOSFETs were initially dominant (through ~28nm), then came SOI MOSFETs (28nm to 16nm), then FinFETs (16nm to 5nm), and now finally Gate-All-Around FETs (GAAFETs, 3nm and beyond).\nAll of that in order to say that this new transistor from [Hailin Peng] and his team is a GAAFET. Its made from bismuth oxyselenide (Bi\u2082O\u2082Se) for the channel, and bismuth selenite oxide (Bi\u2082SeO\u2085) as the gate material. See the article for further details.\nKeep in mind that at this point in time we only have a prototype from a lab and the gory details about how to mass-produce these things, assuming thats even possible, havent yet been worked out. We have previously discussed the difficulty of manufacturing state-of-the-art transistors. If youre interested in bismuth be sure to check out how to use bismuth for desoldering."}

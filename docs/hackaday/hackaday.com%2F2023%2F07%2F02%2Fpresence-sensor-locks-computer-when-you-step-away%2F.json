Even the five- or ten-minute activity timers that are set on most workstations arent really perfect solutions. While ideally in these situations wed all be locking our screens manually when we get up, that doesnt always happen. The only way to guarantee that this problem is solved is to use something like this automatic workstation locker.\nThe project is based around the LD2410 presence sensor, which is itself a small 24 GHz radar module paired with an ESP32 which simplifies the detection of objects and motion. [Enzo] paired one of these modules with a Seed Xiao nrf52840 development board to listen to the radar module and send the screen lock keyboard shortcut to the computer when it detects that the user has walked away from the machine. The only thing that [Enzo] wants to add is a blinking LED to let the user know when the device is about to timeout so that it doesnt accidentally lock the machine when not needed.\nOne of the parts of this build that is a little bit glossed over is the fact that plenty of microcontroller platforms can send keystrokes to a computer even if theyre not themselves a USB keyboard. Even the Arduino Uno can do this, so by now this feature is fairly platform-agnostic. Still, you can use this to your advantage if you have the opposite problem from [Enzo] and need your computer to stay logged in no matter what."}

Rather a more fun example is this digital creation from [Guy Dupont], who made a bumper sticker that broadcasts what hes listening to on the stereo.\n[Guy] found a nice wide 11-inch bar LCD that was the right aspect ratio to suit the bumper sticker aesthetic. It had an HDMI interface, so he decided to drive it with a Raspbery Pi Zero 2W. Power for the system was derived from 12-volt lines going to his vehicles rear view camera. For an enclosure, he simply stuck the Pi and a buck converter on the back of the display and heat shrinked the whole thing. He also threw some magnets in there to stick it to the car.\nHow does the screen know what song to display? Well, [Guy] already has his Spotify listens scrobbling to Last.fm. Thus, he just made a script that scrapes his Last.fm page, which runs on a Particle Boron microcontroller, which has a cellular connection of its own. The Boron gets the song data, and spits it over to the Pi via Bluetooth. Then the Pi generates an image for the display.\nOh, and theres also a neat Easter Egg. In honor of\u00a0brat summer, the background changes to #8ACE00 green if the system detects youre listening to Charli XCX. Neat.\nIts a neat build with a lot of moving parts. Were surprised we havent seen anything like this before though, its really rather fun. Also, hows about that taste of the old Internet\u2014when was the last time you heard somebody mention\u00a0scrobbling?\u00a0Gosh, were getting old.\nWeve featured some of [Guys] works before, too, like the amusing Mailblocks project. Video after the break.\n\n"}

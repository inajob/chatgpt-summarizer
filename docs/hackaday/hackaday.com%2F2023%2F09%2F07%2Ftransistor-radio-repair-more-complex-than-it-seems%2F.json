Thus its also not a staple of the repair bench anymore, where fixing a pocket radio might have been all in a days work decades ago now theyre a rare sight. [David Tipton] has a Philips radio from were guessing the later half of the 1960s which didnt work, and were along for the ride as he takes us through its repair.\nIts an extremely conventional design of the era, with a self-oscillating mixer, 455 kHz IF amplifier, and class AB audio amplifier. The devices are a little archaic by todays standards, with comically low-gain germanium transistors and passives from the Ark. Injecting a signal reveals that the various stages all work, but that mixer isnt oscillating. A lot of fault-finding ensues, and perhaps with a little bit of embarrassment, he eventually discovers a blob of solder shorting a collector resistor to ground. All isnt over though, for the volume pot is also kaput. Who knew that the track from a modern component could be transplanted into one from the 1960s?\n\n", "title": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u30011960\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u6b63\u5e38\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u77ed\u7d61\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u304c\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u4fee\u5fa9\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u304c\u53e4\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9\u3059\u308b", "\u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u8b0e\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u5192\u967a"]}

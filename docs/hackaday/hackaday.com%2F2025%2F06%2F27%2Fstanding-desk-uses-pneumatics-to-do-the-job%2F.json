However, [Matthias Wandel] found a Kloud standing desk that used an altogether different set up. He set about figuring out how it worked in the old-fashioned way\u2014by pulling it apart.\nThe Kloud desk relies on pneumatics rather than electrical actuators to move up and down. Inside the desk sits a small tank that can be pressurized with a hand-cranked mechanism. A lever can then be used to release pressure from this tank into a pair of pneumatic cylinders that drive the top of the desk upwards. The two cylinders are kept moving in sync by a tensioned metal ribbon that ties the two sides together. The mechanism is not unlike a gas lift chair\u2014holding the lever and pushing down lets the desk move back down. Once hes explained the basic mechanism, [Matthias] gets into the good stuff\u2014pulling apart the leg actuator mechanism to show us whats going on inside in greater detail.\nIf youve ever thought about building your own standing desk, this might be a video worth watching. Weve featured some other great pneumatics projects before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

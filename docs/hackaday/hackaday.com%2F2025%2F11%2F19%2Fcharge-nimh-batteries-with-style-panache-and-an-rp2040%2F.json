Sure, you can still get a chargers for the AAs in your life, but its old tech and not particularly stylish. Thats where [Maximilian Kern] comes in, whose SPINC project was recently featured in IEEE Spectrum so you know it has to be good.\nWith the high-resolution LED, the styling of this device reminds us a little bit of the Pi-Mac-Nano and anything that makes you think of a classic Macintosh gets automatic style points. Theres something reminiscent of an ammunition clip in the way batteries are fed into the top and let out the bottom of the machine.\n[Maximilian] thought of the, ah, less-detail-oriented amongst us with this one, as the dedicated charging IC he chose (why reinvent the wheel?) is connected to an H-bridge to allow the charger to be agnostic as to orientation. Thats a nice touch. An internal servo grabs each battery in turn to stick into the charging circuit, and deposits it into the bottom of the device once it is charged. The LCD screen lets you monitor the status of the battery as it charges, while doubling as a handy desk clock (thats where the RP2040 comes in). It is, of course, powered by USB-C-PD as all things are these days. Fast-charging upto 1A is enabled, but you might want to go slower to keep your cells lasting as long as possible. Firmware, gerbers and STLs are available on GitHub under a GPL-3.0 license so if youre still using NiCads or want to bring this design into the glorious lithium future, you can consider yourself welcome to.\nWe recently featured a AA rundown, and for now, it looks like NiMH is still the best bang for your buck, which means this project will remain relevant for a few years yet. Of course, we didnt expect the IEEE to steer us wrong.\nThanks to [George Graves] for the tip."}

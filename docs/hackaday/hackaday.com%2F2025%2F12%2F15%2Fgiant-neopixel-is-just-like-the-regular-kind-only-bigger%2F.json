They make it trivial to add a ton of controllable, glowing LEDs to any project. [Arnov Sharma] has made a great tribute to the WS2812B LED by building the NeoPixel Giant Edition.\nThe build is simply a recreation of the standard 5mm x 5mm WS2812B, only scaled up to 150 mm x 150 mm. It uses a WS2811 chip inside to make it behave in the same way from a logical perspective, and this controller is hooked up to nine standard RGB LEDs switched with MOSFETs to ensure they can deliver the requisite light output. The components are all assembled on a white PCB in much the same layout as the tiny parts of a WS2812B, which is then installed inside a 3D-printed housing made in white PLA. Large metal terminals were added to the housing, just like a WS2812B, and the lens was then created using a large dose of clear epoxy.\nThe result is a fully functional, addressable LED that is approximately 30 times larger than the original. You can even daisy-chain them, just like the real thing. Weve covered all kinds of projects using addressable LEDs over the years, from glowing cubes to fancy nature installations. If youve got your own glowable project that the world needs to see, make sure you notify the tips line!", "title": "\u5de8\u5927\u306aNeoPixel\uff1a150mm x 150mm\u306eWS2812B\u5fa9\u523b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "WS2812B\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u5927\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30cd\u30aa\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u7d0430\u500d\u306e\u5927\u304d\u3055\u3067\u3001\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u5de8\u5927\u306aNeoPixel\uff1a150mm x 150mm\u306eWS2812B\u5fa9\u523b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "WS2811\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3067\u4f5c\u308bDIY NeoPixel", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5149\u308b\u5927\u304d\u306aLED\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u8f1d\u304f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLED\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

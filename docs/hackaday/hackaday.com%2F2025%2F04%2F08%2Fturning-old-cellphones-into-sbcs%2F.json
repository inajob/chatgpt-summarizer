We think it\u2019s a great idea, and have long lamented how many pocket supercomputers simply get tossed in the recycling stream, when they could be put to use in hacker projects. So far, it looks like Citronics only has a prototyping breakout board for the Fairphone 2, but it\u2019s a promising idea.\nOne of the things that\u2019s stopping us from re-using old phones, of course, is the lack of easy access to the peripherals. On the average phone, you\u2019ve got one USB port and that\u2019s it. The Citronics dev provides all sorts of connectivity: 4x USB 2.0, 1x Ethernet 10/100M, and a Raspberry Pi Header (UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO). At the same time, for better or worse, they\u2019ve done away with the screen and its touch interface, and the camera too, but they seem to be keeping all of the RF capabilities.\nThe whole thing runs Linux, which means that this won\u2019t work with every phone out there, but projects like PostmarketOS and others will certainly broaden the range of usable devices. And stripping off the camera and screen has the secondary advantages of removing the parts that get most easily broken and have the least support from custom Linux distros.\nWe wish we had more details about the specifics of the break-out boards, but we like the idea. How long before we see an open-source implementation of something similar? There are so many cheap used and broken cellphones out there that it\u2019s certainly a worthwhile project!"}

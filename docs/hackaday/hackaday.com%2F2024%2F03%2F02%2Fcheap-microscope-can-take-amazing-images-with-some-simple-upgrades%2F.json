To aid in this quest, they need a quality microscope to see what theyre doing. Instead of buying one outright, they purchased a cheap microscope and upgraded it to do the job instead.\nUsability and performance is greatly improved over the stock unit, which was really only fit for learning purposes.\nThe cheap education-grade microscope cost around $50 USD, had few features, and wasnt much chop out of the box. The worst part was the sample stage  which was poorly adjustable in the up-and-down axis and could only track about two centimeters up and down. There was no X or Y axis panning either, and it lacked a proper condensor iris, too. Oh, and the included camera module had a resolution of just 240p.\nTo fix these problems, the microscope was first outfitted with a fully redesigned X-Y-Z stage built out of old components from a salvaged DVD drive and an additional NEMA stepper motor. Camera-wise, it was hooked up with a 2K Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 running at 10 to 15 frames per second, which broadcasts video over a local network for easy viewing on an external monitor. It also gained an epi-illumination setup for doing reflected light microscopy.\nIf youre eager to build a quality microscope with all the controls you personally dream of, this could be a relevant project for you to study. Weve featured some other builds along these lines before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Kelvin Ly] for the tip!", "title": "\u5b89\u304f\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u3001\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u3092\u652f\u63f4", "body": "Birdbrain\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6d41\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u8cea\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3068\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b89\u304f\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u3001\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30eb\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u3092\u652f\u63f4", "50\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u304b\u3089\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3068\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u5411\u4e0a", "\u53e4\u3044DVD\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fX-Y-Z\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u6539\u826f", "Raspberry Pi\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u81ea\u5206\u597d\u307f\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u6301\u3064\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

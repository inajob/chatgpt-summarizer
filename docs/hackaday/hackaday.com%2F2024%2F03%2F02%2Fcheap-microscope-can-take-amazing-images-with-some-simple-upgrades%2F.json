To aid in this quest, they need a quality microscope to see what theyre doing. Instead of buying one outright, they purchased a cheap microscope and upgraded it to do the job instead.\nUsability and performance is greatly improved over the stock unit, which was really only fit for learning purposes.\nThe cheap education-grade microscope cost around $50 USD, had few features, and wasnt much chop out of the box. The worst part was the sample stage  which was poorly adjustable in the up-and-down axis and could only track about two centimeters up and down. There was no X or Y axis panning either, and it lacked a proper condensor iris, too. Oh, and the included camera module had a resolution of just 240p.\nTo fix these problems, the microscope was first outfitted with a fully redesigned X-Y-Z stage built out of old components from a salvaged DVD drive and an additional NEMA stepper motor. Camera-wise, it was hooked up with a 2K Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 running at 10 to 15 frames per second, which broadcasts video over a local network for easy viewing on an external monitor. It also gained an epi-illumination setup for doing reflected light microscopy.\nIf youre eager to build a quality microscope with all the controls you personally dream of, this could be a relevant project for you to study. Weve featured some other builds along these lines before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Kelvin Ly] for the tip!"}

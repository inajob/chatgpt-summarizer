Theyre now useless for broadcast TV, so can often be had for next-to-nothing. [Action Retro] has a video showing a Mac Classic clone using one, and with a built-in Raspberry Pi and a copy of RiscOS it almost makes a usable computer.\nThe video below the break is a little heavy on the 3D printer sponsor and the Mac case comes from a Thingiverse project, but its well executed and were grateful for being introduced to that original project. Wed have gone for a period-correct beige filament rather than the glow-in-the-dark green one used here.\nWere guessing that more than one reader will have a few of those TVs around the place, such is their ubiquity. Is it worth making this as a novelty item? It depends upon your viewpoint, but we cant help liking the result even if perhaps its not for us. If RiscOS isnt quite the thing,\u00a0 theres an option a little closer to the real thing.\n\n"}

Theyre now useless for broadcast TV, so can often be had for next-to-nothing. [Action Retro] has a video showing a Mac Classic clone using one, and with a built-in Raspberry Pi and a copy of RiscOS it almost makes a usable computer.\nThe video below the break is a little heavy on the 3D printer sponsor and the Mac case comes from a Thingiverse project, but its well executed and were grateful for being introduced to that original project. Wed have gone for a period-correct beige filament rather than the glow-in-the-dark green one used here.\nWere guessing that more than one reader will have a few of those TVs around the place, such is their ubiquity. Is it worth making this as a novelty item? It depends upon your viewpoint, but we cant help liking the result even if perhaps its not for us. If RiscOS isnt quite the thing,\u00a0 theres an option a little closer to the real thing.\n\n", "title": "CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fMac Classic\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306f\u751f\u7523\u7d42\u4e86\u3060\u304c\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u7528\u767d\u9ed2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002Mac Classic\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306bRaspberry Pi\u3068RiscOS\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u3001\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5bb6\u306b\u3042\u308b\u306a\u3089\u3001\u8da3\u5473\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fMac Classic\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u7528\u767d\u9ed2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u53e4\u3044CRT\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aMac Classic\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3", "\u9ed2\u767d\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3060Raspberry Pi\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

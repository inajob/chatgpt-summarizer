However, with SMD parts getting smaller and smaller, some kind of microscope is almost a necessity.\nLuckily, you can get USB microscopes for a song now. If youre willing to spend a little more, you can get even get microscopes that have little LCD screens. However, there are some problems with the cheaper end of these microscopes.\nMany of them have small and wobbly stands that arent very practical. Some dont leave you much room to get a soldering iron in between the lens and the part. Worse still, many cheap microscopes have trouble staying still when you have to push buttons or otherwise make adjustments to the device.\nIt seems like every time a new generation of microscopes aimed at the electronics market arrives on the scene, many of the earlier flaws get taken care of. Thats certainly the case with the Andonstar AD409-Max.\n\nSum of its Parts\nWhile the microscope looks a lot like many other Andonstar microscopes and, indeed, a lot of similar devices, youll immediately notice the work area under the microscope is huge and covered with a silicone work mat. Weve put together a short video about the microscope that you can find bellow,\u00a0 followed by the promotional video from Andonstar themselves. That video will happily point out the positive things. Of course, there are a few negatives.\nAn RP2040 PCB under moderate magnification\nAs mentioned in our video, the microscope is built solid and works very well. However, you cant help but feel it is a hodgepodge of separate parts. The lights, for example, have their own switch. So does the endoscope. The camera itself has a WiFi hotspot (it wont connect to your network, however). But when you load the phone app to download pictures and videos, you realize that the microscope thinks its a dashcam. The endoscope, with its little focus knob at the back, also seems like something of an afterthought.\nThese disparate parts lead to having a lot of wires. Of course you can easily 3D print some wire management clips or even use some zip ties to do it yourself. But the whole package would be a bit more impressive if the integration was better.\nThere are two mount points on the lens, one near each end of the lens body. We know some people like to mount at the bottom to get extra working distance, but you dont really need to do that here. That mount is actually made for a ring light if you want to add one. The microscope might not be as stable as it will be when you use the mount closer to the electronics. However, do use one of the mounts. If you screw the ring in the middle of the lens body, you wont be able to turn the lens to focus.\nThe Good News\nThis isnt the end of the world, though. The images look great, and there is a ton of room between the lens and the work surface. The video mentions nearly two feet of room. In retrospect, it is closer to 18 inches, depending on how much magnification you want.\nA ruler can help determine scale.\nStill, thats plenty of space to work on things. Whats more is that, unlike some microscopes, there is a filter protecting the lens from solder fumes and heat. That and the silicone mat make it clear the microscope was made for soldering.\nThe lights are very bright. In fact, if you get what you want out of the light, it becomes very difficult to see. Unlike a ring light, you can adjust the gooseneck lamps to get just the right angle on whatever you need to see.\nThe microscope is well-packed and has a reasonable manual that seems mostly correct. There are several attachments for the endoscope, ranging from a short plastic tube to a little mirror for looking under things. If the screen is too small, you can always connect an HDMI monitor. All the required cables come in the box along with a USB power adapter.\nPutting it to Work\nThere are less expensive alternatives out there. You could, of course, add a larger base to a cheaper unit. You may not really need the endoscope, the helping hands, and the tool holder. But if you dont mind the roughly $450 price tag, this is a very serviceable soldering and inspection microscope.\nMost of the issues are minor, like the cable management. For another example, despite the manual saying you can save default settings, it doesnt seem to work. It would be nice if you could hot-swap the memory card, but you cant. WiFi is a nice thought, but having to disconnect from your normal WiFi to connect to the microscope isnt that convenient.\nIf only you could use this microscope for the Hackaday SMD Challenge!\nBut for the main features, it works well. Sure, some people really like a binocular microscope. They, like anything else, have plusses and minuses, too. Do you have a favorite microscope or other magnifying device for soldering? Or are you lucky enough to have eagle-eye vision? If you do, just wait youll see. Parts are getting smaller every year and your eyes seem to get worse every year, too.\nThe video below shows a little bit of soldering of the SMD challenge board that we use every year at Supercon. Having a microscope is, of course, cheating, but at least we didnt use a nice soldering iron just to be a little fair to everyone whos had to use our terrible setup in the past.\nYou could mount a commercial ring light on the lower lens mount, or why not roll your own? You might not need as many upgrades for this rig as you would for a cheaper microscope.\n\n"}

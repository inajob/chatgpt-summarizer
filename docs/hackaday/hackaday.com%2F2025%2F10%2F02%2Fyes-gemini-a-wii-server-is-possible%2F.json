When the AI overview told him it could not be used as a server, he had his mission: prove that clanker wrong. It already runs Doom, so what else is there to do?\nOf course should not that hard: Linux has been available on the Wii for years now. In fact there are several; he settles on Arch, btw, after trying Debian, Ubuntu, and even NetBSD. Of course it runs NetBSD but NetBSD didnt work with his USB network adapter, which is sadly as predictable as the hardware running NetBSD.\nOK, its not vanilla Arch; its the Wii-Linux Continuation Project, based on ArchPOWER fork that compiles Arch for PPC. As the young YouTuber was surprised to discover, despite not being a PC or particularly powerful, the Wii has a PowerPC CPU. (He might be younger than the console, so well give him a pass.) Wii-Linux couldnt run the USB adapter either (appropriate apologies were offered to NetBSD), but it turns out the internal Ethernet adapter was available all along.\nAs a file server, python-based Copyparty worked flawlessly, but the rust-based Minecraft server he picked was not particularly usable. A little optimization would fix that, since you can serve Minecraft from an ESP32 and the Wii absolutely has more horsepower than that. Doubtless he could have loaded a web-server, and proved Googles AI summary wrong, but the iPad-induced ADHD we all suffer from these days kicks in, so he settled for posting a screenshot of someone elses blog, hosted on a Wii from NetBSD. So the LLM was wrong from the get-go, but the tour of what home-brew loaded OSes still work in 2025 was certainly educational.\nWe could hunt that blog Wii-based blog down for you, but wed be reluctant to link to it anyway: while the AI summary is wrong, and you can use the Wii as a server, that doesnt mean it makes a good one. Wed dont feel the need to inadvertently DDOS some poor unsuspecting shmucks Nintendo, so well let you try and find it yourself.\nJust be warned that all of this Wii hacking may not rest on the best of foundations.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044Nintendo Wii\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u53e4\u3044Wii\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u307f\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6210\u529f\u3068\u5931\u6557\u304c\u8a9e\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044Nintendo Wii\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- ArchLinux\u3067Wii\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Wii\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u3068\u5931\u6557\u306e\u5831\u544a", "- Wii\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cLinux\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\uff01Wii\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

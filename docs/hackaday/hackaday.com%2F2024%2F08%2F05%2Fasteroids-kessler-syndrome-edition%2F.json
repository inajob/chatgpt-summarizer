Often those with the simplest premise, while maintaining a fun, lighthearted gameplay have the most cultural impact and longest legacy. But, although it was popular, it doesnt really meet the high bar of scientific fidelity that some gamers are looking for. Thats why [Attoparsec] built the Kessler Syndrome Edition of this classic arcade game.\nThe Kessler Syndrome is a condition where so much man-made debris piles up in low-Earth orbit that nothing can occupy this orbit without getting damaged or destroyed by the debris, and thus turning into more debris itself in a terrible positive feedback loop. [Attoparsec] brings this idea to Asteroids by reprogramming the game so that asteroids can be shot into smaller and smaller pieces but which never disappear, quickly turning the game into a runaway Kessler Syndrome where the chance of survival is extremely limited, and even a destroyed players ship turns into space junk as well.\nTo further the scientific accuracy and improve playability, though, hes added a repulsor beam mechanism which can push the debris a bit and prolong the players life, and also added mass effect reactions so that even shooting bullets repels the players ship a bit. The build doesnt stop with software, either. He also built a custom 70s-style arcade cabinet from the ground to host the game.\nAsteroids is still a popular platform for unique builds like this. Take a look at a light-vector game using lasers to create the graphics, or this tiny version of the game that uses a real CRT.\nThanks to [smellsofbikes] for the tip!\n\n"}

Pretty much everything was fair game, from costumes to decorations. The top three winners will get $150 credit from DigiKey and some treats from Arduino  just dont try to eat them.\n\nFirst Prize: Flying Ghost\n\nHalloween offers a rare opportunity to not only take your creations out into the world, but to terrorize passerby without consequence. Youd be hard pressed to find a better example of that spirit, no pun intended, than the Flying Ghost created by [Scott Duckworth].\nWeve seen various RC aircraft get dressed up for the holiday in the past, but this example is a bit different. Rather than build his ghost around a free-flying rotorcraft, [Scott] suspended his haunter from a cable system that was connected to a trio of beefy winches that could be controlled by a central microcontroller using RF24L01+ modules. With a sprinkle of trilateration, the system was able to convert the length of line in each winch into a 3D position over the street. After the sun goes gown, the result is an illuminated ghost that can swoop over the heads of trick-or-treaters in silence with no obvious means of propulsion.\nOr at least, that was the idea. Unfortunately, [Scott] ran into a glitch that prevented the central controller from calculating the ghosts position on Halloween, and there wasnt enough time to sort it out before the roving bands of sugar bandits showed up. Not all was lost, as the ghost was still hanging menacingly over the street, but it wasnt able to move around. Naturally, it only took a few minutes to figure out the problem on November 1st. Hey, at least hell be ready for 2024.\nWhat was the problem, you ask? He had defined a variable as int16_t when it should have been int32_t  real spooky stuff around these parts.\n\nSecond Prize: Fire Dragon\n\nThis fire-breathing dragon head from [Science Shack] started its life as a realistic mask from Amazon, but after the addition of some animatronic hardware and a bit of flammable gas, its more than just a pretty face.\nA lightweight acrylic skeleton inside the mask is articulated with three servos, which is enough to provide a reptilian-like head motion without getting too bogged down in the details. A fourth servo is used to depress the nozzle on a can of butane as part of the the 3D printed flamethrower in the beasts mouth. After the gas travels through a small brass tube, its lit off with a spark and the dragon is able to belch out an impressive flame. Luckily the masks latex construction is relatively heat-resistant, so it doesnt melt itself when the heat is on.\nThird Prize: Haunted Keyboard\n\nWhen you think of traditional Halloween decorations and props, a mechanical keyboard probably doesnt make the cut. But what about a\u00a0haunted keyboard? Well thats a different story.\nThis spectral keyboard, created by [Mx. Jack Nelson] is inhabited by the spirit of a particularly terrifying entity: ChatGPT. Once you type in a message, the internal Raspberry Pi Pico forwards it to the large language model (LLM) chatbot so it can produce a suitably spooky response. Once the keyboard receives the results, it types them out as if an unseen hand was at work.\nThe result is something like a futuristic Ouija board; where each question is met with a response thats just vague enough to make you think there might be some kind of intelligence at work. We still wouldnt trust it to write any code for us, but as far as Halloween set dressing goes, it seems more than up to the task.\nHonorable Mentions\nAs usual, this contest featured a number of special categories which the judges were asked to consider while placing their votes.\nCostume: Electronic Harry Potter Wand\nTechnically, all you need to dress up as somebody from the Harry Potter universe is some robes and maybe a scarf. But you wont be much of a witch or a wizard without a wand, where is where this creation from [Mike Kushnerik] comes in.\nThe wand is powered by an Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather microcontroller, which features an onboard LIS3DH three-axis linear accelerometer thats used to detect when a spell is being cast. An RGB LED in the tip of the wand lights up accordingly, and an 18650 cell provides more than enough power to keep the magic going all night.\nA 3D printed enclosure helps to sell the wand look while still being rugged enough to handle a night out. We also appreciated the modular nature of the design, which makes future repairs and upgrades easier.\nPumpkin: Animatronic Halloween Pumpkins\nAccording to [Nico], every year his neighborhood holds a pumpkin carving contest. The locals do their best to produce something exciting with the traditional tools of the trade, and then he comes in and slam dunks on their efforts with his\u00a0 high-tech animatronic singing creations. It truly is the reason for the season.\nHis creation this year takes the form of a trio of pumpkins, which light up and play audio thanks to a Teensy 3.5 which in turn is controlled by an Android application over a Bluetooth link. While two of the pumpkins look more or less like youd expect, the third features a large eyeball that uses a pair of servos to look around and blink.\nThough we imagine there was a considerable temptation just to 3D print the pumpkins so hed be able to use them year after year, we appreciate that [Nico] housed his electronics in real gourds.\nKid-Pleaser: Halloween Candy-Pult\nWhats better than getting candy? Seeing said candy launched into the air and work its way through a convoluted contraption before you get it, obviously. Or at least, that seems to be the idea behind this entry from [pdxalz]. While admittedly a relatively low-tech project compared to the other entries, it has a fun spirit that made it stand out with the judges.\n\nThe original idea was to create a pneumatic Candy Cannon which would fire chocolate bars out of a PVC tube barrel. But it tended to destroy the treats in the process, so [pdxalz] changed gears and built a far less aggressive catapult to fling the sweet treats across the porch and into a faux spider web. From there, they fall into a hopper and then work their way down to a waiting bucket.\nHallowed Home: Organ-Playing Skeleton\nThe components for this project are simple enough: take one broken Hammond organ, combine with a dancing skeleton from the Home Depot, add in a 555 timer, an MP3 playback module, and sprinkle relays liberally. The end result is a otherworldly musical performance with far less complexity than you might expect.\nAs explained by creator [bryan.lowder], the dancing skeleton from the Home Depot had a way of moving its arms that looked a bit like it was playing the organ once properly positioned. The trick was getting it to do it on command, as the dancing didnt start until you pressed a Demo button attached to its back.\nInstead of a microcontroller, he reached for a 555 timer and relay combination that would close the circuit after waiting an appropriate amount of time. The MP3 module, connected to an amplified speaker system, is then kicked in at the appropriate time to complete the scene.\nSpooky: Billy RC Tricycle\nThis last category was an easy one: just build something thats actually scary. On that account, the judges had no problem identifying the Billy RC Tricycle by [Marcel] as the project theyd least like to run into on a dark October night.\nInspired by previous (but less creepy) RC tricycle projects, the components used to steer and propel this roving hell-hound are expertly hidden. In the dark, youd swear the puppet mounted to the bike is really pedaling its way towards you. As if that wasnt bad enough, the custom control board features a DFPlayer module that plays MP3s of unsettling music and manic laughter.\n\n[Marcel] has done a great job documenting the build, and has even provided the files necessary to produce the electronics that allow the tricycle to be remotely operated from a standard PlayStation 3 controller. Under normal circumstances, wed be happy to see such transparencybut the cowards among us would actually prefer not to see a bunch of Billy clones in 2024.\nOnly 11 Months to Go\nHalloween is over now, and most people have their eyes on the fast-approaching holiday season. But then, youre not most people, are you? No, youre reading Hackaday, and that means youve probably started brainstorming what kind of electronic horrors you can put together before Halloween 2024.\nIf the winners werent inspiring enough, make sure to browse through the full list of entries this year. Theres surely something in there that should help get your own macabre machinations off the ground. Just make sure to document your work so you can show it off to us next year.\n \n\n"}

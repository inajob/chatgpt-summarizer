But as small as it is, the board still takes up a fair amount of real estate, especially on solderless breadboards during the prototyping phase of a project. Wouldnt it be nice to shrink down the Nano just a bit and regain a couple of rows for plugging in components and jumpers?\nIt looks like [Albert van Dalen] thought so, and he managed to get a Nanos functionality  and then some  onto a DIP-26 footprint. The aptly named Nano DIP, which at 33 mm x 10 mm  about the same size as the ATmega328 on the Arduino Uno  will tickle the miniaturization fans out there. The board is built around an ATtiny3217 and has almost all of the Nanos features, like a USB port, reset button, built-in LEDs, 5 V regulator, and preloaded bootloader. Its big extra feature is the 350-kilosamples-per-second 8-bit DAC, while sacrificing external crystal pins and a 3.3 V regulator.\nTo make the board cheap enough to manufacture, [Albert] elected a minimum component size of 0402, which made squeezing all the parts onto the board challenging. The MCU barely fits between the header pin pads, and the Micro USB jack had to be a vertical-mount type. It does the business, though, so if youre looking to free up a little breadboard space, check it out."}

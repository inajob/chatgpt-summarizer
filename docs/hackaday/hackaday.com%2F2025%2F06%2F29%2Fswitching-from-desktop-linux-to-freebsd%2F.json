Take FreeBSD, for example. In a recent [GNULectures] video, we get to see a users attempt to switch from desktop Linux to desktop FreeBSD.\nThe interesting thing here is that both are similar and yet very different, mainly owing to their very different histories, with FreeBSD being a direct derivative of the original UNIX and its BSD derivative. One of the most significant differences is probably that Linux is just a kernel, with (usually) the GNU/Hurd userland glued on top of it to create GNU/Linux. GNU and BSD userland are similar, and yet different, with varying levels of POSIX support. This effectively means that FreeBSD is a singular OS with rather nice documentation (the FreeBSD handbook).\n\nThe basic summary here is that FreeBSD is rather impressive and easy to set up for a desktop, especially if you use a customized version like GhostBSD. Despite Libreboot, laptop power management, OSB NVENC, printer, and WiFi issues, it was noted that none of these are uncommon with GNU/Linux either. Having a single package manager (pkg) for all of FreeBSD (and derivatives) simplifies things a lot. The bhyve hypervisor makes running VMs a snap. A robust ZFS filesystem is also a big plus.\nWhat counts against desktop FreeBSD in the end is a less refined experience in some areas, despite FreeBSD being able to run Linux applications courtesy of binary compatibility. With some developer love and care, FreeBSD might make for a nice desktop alternative to GNU/Linux before long, one that could be tempting even for the die-hard Windows holdouts among us.\n", "title": "- FreeBSD\u3068Linux\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9OS\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "body": "FreeBSD\u306fUNIX\u7531\u6765\u3067\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5145\u5b9f\u3001\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u5411\u304d\u3002Linux\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3084\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- FreeBSD\u3068Linux\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9OS\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- \u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7FreeBSD\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8", "- GhostBSD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fFreeBSD\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3068\u5229\u70b9", "- FreeBSD\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u7ba1\u7406\u3068\u4eee\u60f3\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3044", "- Windows\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01FreeBSD\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u4f53\u9a13"]}

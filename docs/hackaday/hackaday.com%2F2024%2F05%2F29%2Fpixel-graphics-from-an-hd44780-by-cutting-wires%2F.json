And while you can play some clever tricks with user-defined characters, if you want to treat the display as an array of pixels, you\u2019ve got to get out your scalpel and cut up a data line.\nThe hack builds on work from [MisterHW] who documented the bits going from the common display driver to the display, and suggested that by cutting the data line and sending your own bits, you could send arbitrary graphics. The trick was to make sure that they\u2019re in sync with the display, though, which means reading the frame sync line in user code.\nThis done, it looks like [Felipe] has it working! If you can read Rust for the ESP32, he has even provided us with a working demo of the code that makes it work.\nWe can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s not possible to go even lower-level and omit the HD44780 entirely. Has anyone tried driving one of these little LCD displays directly from a microcontroller, essentially implementing the HD44780 yourself?\nAny way you slice it, this is a cool hack, and it opens up the doors to DOOM, or as [MisterHW] suggests, Bad Apple on these little displays . If you do it, we want to see it.\nIf your needs aren\u2019t so exotic, the classic HD44780 display is a piece of cake to get working, and an invaluable tool in anyone\u2019s toolbox.", "title": "HD44780\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u5358\u4f4d\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "HD44780\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5909\u66f4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3084\u3001\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u4efb\u610f\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30c7\u30e2\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304b\u3089LCD\u3092\u76f4\u63a5\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["HD44780\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u5358\u4f4d\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067HD44780\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Rust\u3068ESP32\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30e2\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "HD44780\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u4efb\u610f\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306aHD44780\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

If youre interested in the ESP32 or WiFi in general, theyve also got a nice deep dive into how that all works.\nOn the ESP32, theres a radio, demodulator, and a media access controller (MAC) that takes care of the lowest-level, timing-critical bits of the WiFi protocol. The firmware that drives the MAC hardware is a licensed blob, and while the API or this blob is well documented  thats how we all write software that uses WiFi after all  its limited in what it lets us do. If the MAC driver firmware were more flexible, we could do a lot more with the WiFi, from AirDrop clones to custom mesh modes.\nThe talk starts with [Jasper] detailing how he reverse engineered a lot of Espressifs MAC firmware. It involved Ghidra, a Faraday cage, and a lucky find of the function names in the blob. [Frostie] then got to work writing the MAC driver that he calls Ferris-on-Air. Right now, its limited to normal old station mode, but its definite proof that this line of work can bear fruit.\nThis is clearly work in progress  theyve only been at this for about a year now  but well be keeping our eyes on it. The promise of the ESP32, and its related family of chips, being useful as a more general purpose WiFi hacking tool is huge."}

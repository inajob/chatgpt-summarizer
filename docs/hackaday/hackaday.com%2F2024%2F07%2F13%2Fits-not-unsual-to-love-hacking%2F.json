Nothing is better than being really stoked about a clever hack and then being able to share it with tens of thousands of like-minded folks. Sure, it\u2019s our job, but we really do it because we love to share. And it\u2019s clear that you all do too! After all, we write up the hacks that you document for us.\nWe recently featured a hack where the guy who did the work in question said that he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cworthy of Hackaday\u201d. (Of course, it was!) And I don\u2019t like that sentiment at all, honestly, because a hack that you enjoyed doing is a hack worth sharing, even if just for sharing the joy of doing it, and that came across fully.\nOf course we gladly feature the ultra-bravado hacks where the nearly impossible is made real. But there\u2019s equal value in the simple hacks that inspire others to pursue one odd path or another. Or even pieces where there\u2019s no hack involved, but simply the sharing of something cool.\nThis week, [Arya Voronova] wrote a piece about her experience using MicroPython on embedded devices, and it apparently resonated with a lot of our readers. It\u2019s not a deep-dive into MicroPython, or a mind-bending abuse of the language. Instead, it\u2019s a simple \u201cthis is what I love about doing things this way\u201d, and that\u2019s a great perspective that often gets lost when we get deep in the technical weeds.\nI had the same realization a few months back at Hackaday Europe. In the lightning talks, most everyone gave talks about cool projects that they are working on, and they\u2019re absolutely worth watching for that. [Jaap Meijers] gave a wonderful talk about making animated QR codes, but it wasn\u2019t about how he invented animated QR codes, because he was just using someone else\u2019s project. Instead, it was about how neat he thought someone else\u2019s work was, and how he really wanted to share it with us. (And now you know too.)\nEpic hacks are fantastic, no question. But the simple expression of the love of hacking, whether in words or in the doing, is equally important. Show us your work, but don\u2019t forget to show us your joy along the way.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

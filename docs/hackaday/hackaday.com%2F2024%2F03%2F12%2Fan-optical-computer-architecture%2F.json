But what will that look like for a general-purpose computer? German researchers explain it in a recent scientific paper. Although the DOC-II used optical processing, it did use some conventional electronics. The question is, how can you construct a general computer that uses only optical technology?\nThe paper outlines Millers criteria for practical optical logic gates. In particular, any optical scheme must provide outputs suitable for introduction to another gates inputs and also support fan out of one output to multiple inputs. It is also desirable that each stage does not propagate signal degradation and isolate its outputs from its inputs. The final two criteria note that practical systems dont depend on loss for information representation since this isnt reliable across paths, and, similarly, the gates should require high-precision adjustment to work correctly.\nThe paper also identifies many misconceptions about new computing devices. For example, they assert that while general-purpose desktop-class CPUs today contain billions of devices, use a minimum of 32-bits of data path, and contain RAM, this isnt necessarily true for CPUs that use different technology. If that seems hard to believe, they make their case throughout the paper. We cant remember the last scientific paper we read that literally posed the question, Will it run Doom? But this paper does actually propose this as a canonical question.\n\nWe arent sure we follow all of their arguments, but they do make the case that combining digital techniques with analog light representations may provide unexpected benefits. The paper indicates theyve built a two-bit demonstration of the optical circuits and demonstrated that computation with them is possible.\nWhat would optical CPUs mean to our community? We dont know. While here are people who hack optics, it isnt nearly as well-developed as what we know as a group about electronics. Still, someone will do it and, when they do, well write about it.\nUsing optics for specific computations is nothing new, of course. You can even build a neural network with glass.", "title": "\u5149\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6c4e\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u672a\u6765", "body": "\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u5149\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3088\u304f\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u6c4e\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u3069\u3046\u306a\u308b\u306e\u304b\u3002\u72ec\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3089\u306f\u3001\u5149\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u306b\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5149\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u57fa\u6e96\u3092\u660e\u793a\u3057\u3001\u5149CPU\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u8ad6\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5149\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6c4e\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u672a\u6765", "\u5149\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u57fa\u6e96", "\u5149\u6280\u8853\u306e\u307f\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u6c4e\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5149\u56de\u8def\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u5149CPU\u304c\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u5f71\u97ff"]}

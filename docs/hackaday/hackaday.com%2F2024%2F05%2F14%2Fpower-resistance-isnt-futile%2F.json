So, how hard can it be to make a high-power resistor? In the video below, he examines a commercial power resistor and how to make your own using nichrome wire.\nSure, in theory, you can use a long piece of wire, but normally, you want to minimize the amount of space occupied. This leads to winding the wire around some substrate. If you just wind the wire, though, you get an inductor. This can cause nasty voltage spikes when there is a change in current through the resistor. You can get noninductive wire wound resistors that use either two opposing windings or alternate the turn direction on each turn. This causes the magnetic fields to tend to cancel out, reducing the overall inductance.\nNichrome wire has more resistance per millimeter and can dissipate more power. Modern digital meters can measure the resistance of a wire if you account for the test leads. To make a substrate, [Electronoobs] got creative since he anticipated generating a lot of heat. The final product even uses water cooling.\nWhy do you want a big resistor? Maybe you need a dummy load, or you want to drain some batteries. If you want to recycle nichrome wire, it is much more common than you might expect.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u304c\u3001\u9ad8\u96fb\u529b\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30cb\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u975e\u8a98\u5c0e\u6027\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002\u78c1\u754c\u3092\u76f8\u6bba\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u3084\u3001\u6c34\u51b7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u7528\u9014\u3084\u3001\u30cb\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u8a00\u53ca\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d", "\u300c\u30cb\u30af\u30ed\u30e0\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9\u554f\u984c\u3068\u5bfe\u7b56\u300d", "\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u62b5\u6297\u306e\u8a08\u6e2c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d"]}

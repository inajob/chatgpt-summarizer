One of the worst things about a trackpoint is its usual placement, which can force a weird hand position that can cause repetitive stress injury.\n[notshitashi] has done an incredible job of adding a trackpoint to the Glove80 wireless split keyboard. It must have been really scary to drill holes in the palm rests of such a nice and not-cheap keyboard, but [notshitashi] soldiered on nonetheless, and the end result looks great.\nStarting with a trackpoint module from Ali, [notshitashi] found that it didnt fit the palm rest without being trimmed down, so they desoldered the business part from the main PCB and reattached it with wires. They had to go through a few of them to get it just right, but thats the way it goes sometimes.\n[notshitashi] calls this a bit of a cheat and dirty hack because the trackpoint module is wired and, therefore, a separate USB HID. Yes, the Glove80 has GPIO connectors in both halves, but the problem is that stock ZMK has yet to support pointing devices. We dont care; this is quite the elegant hack anyway.\nWant to jazz up your mechanical keyboard with a trackpoint? Heres a handy guide. Or, you can perform a transplant."}

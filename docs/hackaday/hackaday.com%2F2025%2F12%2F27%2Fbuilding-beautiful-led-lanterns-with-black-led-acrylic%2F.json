They wanted to build ever more attractive lanterns for a local parade event. They recently discovered a fantastic material that can really improve the look of whatever project you might be building with LEDs.\nThe material is commonly referred to as Black LED Acrylic or similar. In this case, it was sourced from TAP Plastics, though you can source similar acrylic from other vendors, too. From first glance, it looks like any other piece of black acrylic plastic. However, shine an LED through it, and it will be beautifully diffused and smoothed out to wonderful visual effect. A simple test of a 33 array of LEDs behind a 3D-printed grid shows how good this can look. It almost entirely eliminates hot spots, and the result looks like a display built out of juicy glowing cubes. The duo used this material to produce giant pixel art lanterns for their local parade. We only get a glimpse at the final build, but it appears giant Pacman and Blinky totems are on the way.\nIf youve been struggling to find a good way to diffuse the light from LEDs, you might want to give this stuff a try. Alternatively, you might explore some other methods weve looked at before, and dont discount ping pong balls, either.\n\n\n", "title": "- LED\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u62e1\u6563\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30afLED\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "LED\u306e\u5149\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u62e1\u6563\u3059\u308b\u9ed2\u3044\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["- LED\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u62e1\u6563\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30afLED\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u5de8\u5927\u306a\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "- \u5730\u5143\u306e\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- LED\u5149\u3092\u5747\u4e00\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u5149\u306e\u6f14\u51fa\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u96c6"]}

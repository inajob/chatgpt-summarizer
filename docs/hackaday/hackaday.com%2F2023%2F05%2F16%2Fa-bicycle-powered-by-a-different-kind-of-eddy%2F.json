But this bicycle, modified by Tom Stanton as shown in the video below the break, has been modified by ditching its direct drive gearing in favor of using the friction-like eddy currents between magnets and copper to transfer power to the wheel.\nBefore even beginning to construct a mechanism for powering the bicycle, Tom had to figure out the basics: What kind of materials could be used for a metal disk? The answer, after much testing: Copper. What kind of magnets work best, and in what formation? Expensive high grade, aligned North to South pole for added eddy-dragging goodness. Would the mechanism work with any efficiency?\nTo find out, Tom would need a custom freewheel type of assembly that simply doesnt exist, where a sprocket would drive a circular plate, and the plate would spin next to a copper disk, and well just watch the video for a demonstration.\nThe end result is interesting to watch, and its not exactly as youd have expected. Yes, eddy currents drive the copper hub, but at a 100rpm difference. Where does all of that energy go? Hint: Not to the wheel, and certainly not into propelling the bicycle. All in all its a fantastic experiment with unpredictable results.\nIf bicycle based bumbling about bakes your biscuits, you might appreciate this tennis-ball-enhanced ride too.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u9285\u3067\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u30c8\u30e0\u30fb\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u306f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u9285\u306e\u9593\u306b\u8a98\u5c0e\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u751f\u304b\u3057\u3066\u52d5\u529b\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u9285\u677f\u3084\u78c1\u77f3\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u3082\u69d8\u3005\u306b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u4e88\u60f3\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b100rpm\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u5dee\u304c\u73fe\u308c\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\u3059\u3079\u304d\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u9285\u3067\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u6392\u9664\u3057\u3066\u7570\u8272\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u79fb\u52d5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6311\u6226", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "Eddy Merckx\u4ee5\u5916\u306b\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3059\u3079\u304d\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3068\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u96fb\u6d41", "\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u3082\u305c\u3072\u6ce8\u76ee\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044"]}

But this bicycle, modified by Tom Stanton as shown in the video below the break, has been modified by ditching its direct drive gearing in favor of using the friction-like eddy currents between magnets and copper to transfer power to the wheel.\nBefore even beginning to construct a mechanism for powering the bicycle, Tom had to figure out the basics: What kind of materials could be used for a metal disk? The answer, after much testing: Copper. What kind of magnets work best, and in what formation? Expensive high grade, aligned North to South pole for added eddy-dragging goodness. Would the mechanism work with any efficiency?\nTo find out, Tom would need a custom freewheel type of assembly that simply doesnt exist, where a sprocket would drive a circular plate, and the plate would spin next to a copper disk, and well just watch the video for a demonstration.\nThe end result is interesting to watch, and its not exactly as youd have expected. Yes, eddy currents drive the copper hub, but at a 100rpm difference. Where does all of that energy go? Hint: Not to the wheel, and certainly not into propelling the bicycle. All in all its a fantastic experiment with unpredictable results.\nIf bicycle based bumbling about bakes your biscuits, you might appreciate this tennis-ball-enhanced ride too.\n\n"}

Public engagement activities for technology or science have a crucial role in bringing forth the next generations of curious people into those fields, and along the way they can provide some fun for grown-ups too.\nA case in point is from NASAs Landsat engagement team, Your Name In Landsat. Type in a text string, and it will spell it out in Earth features seen by the imaging satellites, that resemble letters. Endless fun can be had by all, as the random geology flashes by.\nNo text emojis, boo hiss!\nIn itself, though fun, its not quite a hack. But behind the kids toy were curious as to how the images were identified, and mildly sad that the NASA PR people havent seen fit to tell us. Were guessing that over the many decades of earth images there exists a significant knowledge base of Earth features with meaningful or just amusing shapes that will have been gathered by fun-loving engineers, and its possible that this is what informed this feature. But wed also be curious to know whether they used an image classification algorithm instead. There must be a NASA employee or two who reads Hackaday and could ask around  let us know in the comments.\nMeanwhile, if LANDSAT interests you, its possible to pull out of the air for free.", "title": "NASA Landsat\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u540d\u524d\u3092\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5730\u5f62\u3067\u8868\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300cYour Name In Landsat\u300d", "body": "\u82e5\u8005\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3078\u306e\u8208\u5473\u306f\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u3084\u4eba\u751f\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u6280\u8853\u3084\u79d1\u5b66\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u516c\u5171\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u65fa\u76db\u306a\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u3092\u80b2\u6210\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3002NASA\u306eLandsat\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u304c\u305d\u306e\u4e00\u4f8b\u3002\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u306a\u5730\u8cea\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3055\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["NASA Landsat\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u540d\u524d\u3092\u5730\u7403\u306e\u5730\u5f62\u3067\u8868\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300cYour Name In Landsat\u300d", "\u516c\u5171\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u3078\u306e\u8208\u5473", "\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3068\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u306b\u5c0e\u304f\u8981\u7d20", "NASA Landsat\u753b\u50cf\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u904a\u3073\u5fc3", "\u7121\u6599\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308bLANDSAT\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf"]}

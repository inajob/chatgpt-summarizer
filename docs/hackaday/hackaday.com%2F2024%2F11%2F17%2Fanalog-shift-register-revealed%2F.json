But it wasnt long ago that wasnt a realistic option. Some devices used mechanical means, but there were also ICs like the TCA350 bucket brigade device that [10maurycy10] shows us in a recent post.\nIn this case, bucket brigade is a euphemism calling to mind how firemen would pass buckets down the line to put out a fire. Its a bit of an analog analogy. The bucket is a MOSFET and capacitor. The water is electrical charge stored in the cap.\u00a0 All those charges are tiny snippets of an analog signal.\n\nIn practice, the chip has two clock signals that do not overlap. The first one gates the signal to a small capacitor which follows the input signal voltage. Then, when that gate clock closes, the second clock gates that output to another identical capacitor. The second capacitor discharges the first one and the whole process repeats, sometimes for hundreds of times.\nIn addition to a test circuit and some signals going in and out, the post also shows photomicrographs of the chips insides. As you might expect, all those identical gates make for a very regular layout on the die.\nYou might think these devices are obsolete, and thats true. However, the basic idea is still in use for CCD camera sensors.\nSometimes, those old delay lines were actually columns of mercury or coiled-up transmission lines. You could even use a garden hose or build your own delay line memory.", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u9045\u5ef6: \u30d0\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30ea\u30b2\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u9045\u5ef6\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u3084IC\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u9045\u5ef6: \u30d0\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30ea\u30b2\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6280\u8853: TCA350\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u97f3\u58f0\u9045\u5ef6", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u97f3\u97ff\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u9045\u5ef6\u6280\u8853\u3068\u305d\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u5fdc\u7528", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c: \u5ef6\u9577\u97f3\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u9045\u5ef6\u7dda"]}

Those are the folks that are willing to sign up even without knowing who will be speaking or what this years badge looks like. Once those are sold out, the regular admission tickets will cost $296 (plus fees). We might be slightly biased, but even at full price, we like to think Supercon is a screaming deal.\nThose who join us in Pasadena, California from October 31st through November 2nd can look forward to a weekend of talks, workshops, demos, and badge hacking. But whats more, youll experience the unique sense of camaraderie thats produced when you pack hundreds of hardware hackers into an alleyway and ply them with as much caffeine as they can handle. Some treat it like a normal hacker con, others as a social experiment, but nobody thinks of it as anything less than a fantastic time.\nWere still working closely with our friends at Supplyframe, DigiKey, and Framework to put together a full itinerary for Supercon 2025, so stay tuned over the coming weeks as things are finalized. But in the meantime, weve got a couple new additions this year that were pretty excited about.\n\nFriday Halloween Party\nLast year it worked out that the night before Supercon happened to align with Halloween, so we put together a little pre-con costume party. It was a big hit, and since this year the first day of Supercon will actually fall on All Hallows Eve, we decided to really lean into it.\nSo on Friday night from 5:00 to 10:00 PM, well be hosting a sci-fi themed costume party at the Supplyframe HQ. There will be prizes for the best dressed, and well obviously be on the lookout for costumes that incorporate futuristic, retro-futuristic, or sci-fi techie details. And being a Hackaday event, theres no such thing as too many LEDs.\nThose whove joined us in the past may notice that the time and location of the party puts it during what could best be described as the general hacking period of Friday evening. Fear not. Participation is completely optional, and attendees who wish to keep their head down and continue working on their badge will of course be free to do so. Its what Mr. Spock would do.\nCall for Retro Communications Tech!\nWe love Retro Tech at Hackaday, and we know you do to. Thats why this year were curating a crowd-sourced exhibit of retro communication electronics from 1940 to 2000: radios, pagers, walkie-talkies, early cell phones, ham rigs, weird prototypes, you name it. Any thematic connection between this project and the Supercon 2025 badge may or may not be completely coincidental.\nIf youve got gear that talked, beeped, buzzed, or connected us before the age of the smartphone, we want to see it. So get it out of the attic, dust it off, tell us its story, and help bring this exhibit to life. As with last years popular Display Tech exhibit, all of the hardware will be considered on loan, and it will be returned to its owner after the event. Shipping shouldnt be too much of an issue for handheld devices, but for the larger pieces of hardware, wed ideally be looking for stuff thats already in the Southern California area. That said, if youve got something really unique that youd like to show off, dont be afraid to contact us  well probably be able to work something out.\nThe deadline for submissions is September 1st, and the hardware itself will need to be in Pasadena by September 30th to be included in the exhibit. If youre interested, just fill out this form and well be in touch.\nAll We Need Now is You!\nWell be scrambling behind the scenes up until the very last minute (and maybe a bit over) to put together another unforgettable Supercon, but the truth is, the most important part of the equation is the attendees. An event is only as good as the folks who show up, and for the last several years, weve been fortunate enough to have an incredible cast of hackers and makers join us for an event that we truly believe is unlike anything else out there.\nWhether youre a veteran of several Supercons, or thinking of making 2025 your first year, we cant wait to see you in November.", "title": "- 2025\u5e74Hackaday Supercon\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u958b\u59cb\uff01", "body": "2025\u5e74\u30cf\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30fb\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u958b\u59cb\u3002\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u3084\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u5c55\u793a\u3082\u958b\u50ac\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["- 2025\u5e74Hackaday Supercon\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u958b\u59cb\uff01", "- \u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\uff01 ", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c55\u793a\u3001\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u52df\u96c6\u4e2d", "- Supercon2025\u3067\u306e\u7279\u5225\u306a\u4ef2\u9593\u610f\u8b58\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u521d\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u3082\u5927\u6b53\u8fce\uff01\u30ef\u30af\u30ef\u30af\u3059\u308b\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u308b"]}

It provides a basic operating system level with the ability to run apps from an SD card, and it has the choice of a headless version or an LVGL-based touch UI.\nSupported devices so far are some Lillygo and M5Stack boards, with intriguingly, support in the works for the Cheap Yellow Display board thats caught some attention recently. The term ESP32 is now a wide one encompassing Tensilica and RISC-V cores and a range of capabilities, so time will tell how flexible it is for all branches of the family.\nWe find this OS to be interesting, both in its own right and because it joins at least two others trying to do the same thing. Theres [Sprite_TM]s PocketSprite mini console, and the operating system used by the series of Netherlands hacker camp badges,\u00a0 Well be trying to get a device running it, in order to give you a look at whether its suitable for your projects. If it runs well on the cheaper hardware, it could be a winner!"}

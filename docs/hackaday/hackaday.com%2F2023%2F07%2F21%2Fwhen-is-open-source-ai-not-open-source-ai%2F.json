This is an AI text model which is thought to surpass ChatGPT in capabilities, and which the social media turned VR turned own all your things company wants you to know is open to all. Thats right, the code is open source and you can download the model, and Meta want you to feel warm and fuzzy about it. Unfortunately all is not as it seems, because of course the model isnt open-source and is subject to a licensing restriction which makes it definitely not free of charge for larger users. This is of course disappointing to anyone hoping for an AI chatbot without restrictions, but were guessing Meta would prefer not to inadvertently enable a competitor.\nHappily for the open source user large or small who isnt afraid of a little work theres an alternative in the form of OpenLLaMA, but we understand that wont be for all users. Whichever LLM you use though, please dont make the mistake of imagining that it possesses actual intelligence.\nThanks to the CoupledAI team for the tip!"}

For example, [Willyrags05] took a lamp  looks like something you might find at a resale shop  harvested the gooseneck tubes from it.\nBefore 3D printing, it would have required ingenuity to cobble together some way to secure base and add a clamp to the other end. A blob of epoxy wouldnt look as nice and not everyone can machine nice round adapters. Dont have the same lamp? No problem. You can easily modify the adapters or create new ones to print for yourself.\nOutside of the 3D printer, the project required a way to cut the ends off the tubes. [Willy] used a chop saw, but it seems like a hacksaw or bolt cutters might work. Neatness doesnt count since the printed adapter will cover all sins.\nOnce the tubes are ready, some glue, magnets, and alligator clips (why arent these crocodile clips?) complete the assembly. [Willy] mentions he needs stronger magnets, but we might have been tempted to make the bases wider with depressions for multiple magnets. This is probably a project you wont duplicate exactly, but it may well inspire you to upcycle that old lamp in the attic.\nMaybe you prefer a vise-like holder. There are plenty of other choices."}

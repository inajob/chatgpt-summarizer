Sometimes, its best done in a one-off fashion and sold for a hugely inflated price. Othertimes, its more accessible, and it becomes desirable to sell it in great quantity. [Wesley Treat] has been doing just that, and hes shared some of his tricks of the trade on YouTube.\nThe video concerns some retro-futuristic raygun artwork panels that [Wesley] made in a recent video. The panels proved mighty popular, which meant he had a new problem to contend with: how to make them in quantity. His initial process largely involved making them in a one-off fashion, and that simply wouldnt scale.\n[Wesley] starts right at the beginning, demonstrating first how he produces stacks of blanks for his art panels. For production scale, he used pre-painted matte aluminium panels to speed the process. Its followed by a sanding step, before the panels go into a laser etching jig to get imprinted with [Wesleys] makers mark. Panels are then drilled via CNC, etched with their front artwork, and then fitted with a front acrylic panel, similarly cut out on the laser cutter. Then its just a matter of packing and shipping, a logistical hurdle that many small businesses have had to overcome.\n[Wesley] does a great job of examining what it takes to scale from building one of something to many. Its a topic weve looked at a few times in the past. Video after the break.\n\n"}

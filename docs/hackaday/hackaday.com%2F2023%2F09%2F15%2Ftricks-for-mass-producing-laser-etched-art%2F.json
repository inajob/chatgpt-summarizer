Sometimes, its best done in a one-off fashion and sold for a hugely inflated price. Othertimes, its more accessible, and it becomes desirable to sell it in great quantity. [Wesley Treat] has been doing just that, and hes shared some of his tricks of the trade on YouTube.\nThe video concerns some retro-futuristic raygun artwork panels that [Wesley] made in a recent video. The panels proved mighty popular, which meant he had a new problem to contend with: how to make them in quantity. His initial process largely involved making them in a one-off fashion, and that simply wouldnt scale.\n[Wesley] starts right at the beginning, demonstrating first how he produces stacks of blanks for his art panels. For production scale, he used pre-painted matte aluminium panels to speed the process. Its followed by a sanding step, before the panels go into a laser etching jig to get imprinted with [Wesleys] makers mark. Panels are then drilled via CNC, etched with their front artwork, and then fitted with a front acrylic panel, similarly cut out on the laser cutter. Then its just a matter of packing and shipping, a logistical hurdle that many small businesses have had to overcome.\n[Wesley] does a great job of examining what it takes to scale from building one of something to many. Its a topic weve looked at a few times in the past. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ef\u30f3\u30aa\u30d5\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8? \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u91cf\u7523\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u4e00\u70b9\u3082\u306e\u3092\u9ad8\u984d\u3067\u8ca9\u58f2\u3059\u308b\u4e00\u65b9\u3067\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u3057\u3066\u8ca9\u58f2\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002[Wesley Treat]\u306f\u91cf\u7523\u306b\u82e6\u52b4\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001YouTube\u3067\u305d\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u5bdf\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ef\u30f3\u30aa\u30d5\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8? \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u91cf\u7523\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u91cf\u7523\u5316\u306b\u60a9\u3080\uff1f CNC\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff01\u88fd\u9020\u898f\u6a21\u3092\u62e1\u5927\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u304b\u3089\u914d\u9001\u307e\u3067\uff01\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u3067\u3082\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d"]}

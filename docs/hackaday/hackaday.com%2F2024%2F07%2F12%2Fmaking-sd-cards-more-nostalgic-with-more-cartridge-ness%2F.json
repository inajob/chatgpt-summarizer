In a fit of righteous nostalgia, [Abe] decided that hed turn SD cards into cartridges in the best way possible, and amazingly managed to not only finish the project after two years, but also make it look snazzy enough to have come straight out of the 1980s. The resulting cartridges come both with fixed (256 MB) and removable micro SD card storage, which are mounted on a PCB that passively connects to pogo pins in the custom, 3D printed reader.\nFront of an SD-card-turned-cartridge with adn without decal. (Credit: Abes Projects, YouTube)\nThe inspiration for this project kicked in while [Abe] was working on a floppy drive conversion project called the Floppy8, which crammed an MCU into an external floppy drive along with a rough version of these SD card-based cartridges that used the physical cards edge connector to connect with a micro SD slot inside the converted floppy drive. The problem with this setup was that alignment was terrible, and micro SD cards would break, along with a range of other quality of life issues.\nNext, the SD card was put into a slot on the carrier PCB that featured its own edge connector. This improved matters, but the overly complicated (moving) read head in the reader turned out to be very unreliable, in addition to FDM printed parts having general tolerance and durability issues. Eventually a simplified design which takes these limitations in mind was created that so far seems to work just fine.\nAlthough SD cards in cartridges are not a new idea, using them purely as a data carrier is far less common. One could argue about the practicality of turning a fingernail-sized micro SD card into something much larger, but in terms of aesthetics and handleability it definitely gets an A+.\n\n", "title": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30022\u5e74\u304b\u304b\u308a\u30011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306b\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002256MB\u306e\u56fa\u5b9a\u304a\u3088\u3073\u53d6\u308a\u5916\u3057\u53ef\u80fd\u306amicroSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002PCB\u4e0a\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3002\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u8607\u308b\u672a\u6765\u611f\u899a\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5316\u3059\u308b", "\u53ef\u611b\u304f\u3066\u4fbf\u5229\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3055\u305f\u3063\u3077\u308a\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u9b45\u529b\uff01SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u98a8\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba"]}

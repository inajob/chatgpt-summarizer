Its history is also the topic of a recent video by [The Serial Port], in which\u00a0[Mark] covers the development history of this device. We previously covered the LANBridge 100 Ethernet bridge and what it meant as Ethernet saw itself forced to scale from a shared medium (ether) to a star topology featuring network bridges and switches.\nFeatured in the video is also an interview with [John Reed], a field service network technician who worked at DEC from 1980 to 1998. He demonstrates what the world was like with early Ethernet, with thicknet coax (10BASE5) requiring a rather enjoyable way to crimp on connectors. Even with the relatively sluggish 10 Mbit of thicknet Ethernet, adding an Ethernet store and forward bridge in between two of these networks required significant amounts of processing power due to the sheer number of packets, but the beefy Motorola 68k CPU was up to the task.\nTo prevent issues with loops in the network, the spanning tree algorithm was developed and implemented, forming the foundations of the modern-day Ethernet LANs, as demonstrated by the basic LAN Bridge 100 unit that [Mark] fires up and which works fine in a modern-day LAN after its start-up procedure. Even if todays Ethernet bridges and switches got smarter and more powerful, it all started with that first LAN Bridge.\n\n", "title": "DEC LAN Bridge 100: \u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u30de\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3", "body": "\u3010\u8981\u7d04\u3011DECs LAN Bridge 100\u306fEthernet\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001LAN\u306e\u6210\u9577\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u6709\u7528\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3067\u306fMark\u304c\u958b\u767a\u306e\u7d4c\u7def\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u30011980\u5e74\u304b\u30891998\u5e74\u307e\u3067DEC\u3067\u52e4\u52d9\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305fJohn Reed\u3068\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3082\u6570\u591a\u304f\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DEC LAN Bridge 100: \u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u30de\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3", "The Serial Port\u304c\u8a9e\u308bLAN Bridge 100\u306e\u958b\u767a\u53f2", "DEC\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc: \u65e9\u671f\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30ed\u30fc\u30e968k CPU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fLAN Bridge 100", "\u30b9\u30d1\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8LAN\u306e\u57fa\u76e4"]}

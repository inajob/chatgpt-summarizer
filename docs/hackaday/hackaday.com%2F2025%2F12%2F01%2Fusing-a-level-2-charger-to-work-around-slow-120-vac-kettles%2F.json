Naturally, in a fit of nationalistic pride this leads certain North American people like that bloke over at the [Technology Connections] YouTube to insist that this is fine, as he tries to demonstrate how ridiculous 240 VAC kettles are by abusing a North American Level 2 car charger to power a UK-sourced kettle.\nIgnoring for a moment that in Europe a Level 1 charger is already 230 VAC (\u00b110%) and many of us charge EVs at home with three-phase ~440 VAC, this video is an interesting demonstration, both of how to abuse an EV car charger for other applications and how great having hot water for tea that much faster is.\nFriendly tea-related transatlantic jabs aside, the socket adapter required to go from the car charger to the UK-style plug is a sight to behold. All which we starts as we learn that Leviton makes a UK-style outlet for US-style junction boxes, due to Gulf States using this combination. This is subsequently wired to the pins of the EV charger connector, after which the tests can commence.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two US kettles took nearly five minutes to boil the water, while the UK kettle coasted over the finish line at under two minutes, allowing any tea drinker to savor the delightful smells of the brewing process while their US companion still stares forlornly at their American Ingenuity in action.\nBeginning to catch the gist of why more power now is better, the two US kettles were then upgraded to a NEMA 6-20 connector, rated for 250 VAC and 20 A, or basically your standard UK ring circuit outlet depending on what fuse you feel bold enough to stick into the appliances power plug. This should reduce boiling time to about one minute and potentially not catch on fire in the process.\nBoth of the kettles barely got a chance to overheat and boiled the water in 55 seconds. Unfortunately only the exposed element kettle survived multiple runs, and both found themselves on an autopsy table as it would seem that these kettles are not designed to heat up so quickly. Clearly a proper fast cup of tea will remain beyond reach of the average North American citizen beyond sketchy hacks or using an old-school kettle.\nMeanwhile if youd like further international power rivalry, dont forget to look into the world as seen through its power connectors.\n", "title": "\u300c\u5317\u7c73\u3068\u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u5bfe\u6c7a\u300d", "body": "120VAC\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u3067\u306e\u6e6f\u6cb8\u3057\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u3084\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002 UK\u306e\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u306f\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u3067\u6e6f\u3092\u6cb8\u304b\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u5317\u7c73\u3068\u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u5bfe\u6c7a\u300d", "\u300cEV\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u8a66\u9a13\u300d", "\u300c\u9ad8\u901f\u6cb8\u9a30\uff01\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u6539\u9020\u300d", "\u300c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b1\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u96fb\u5727\u3068\u6cb8\u9a30\u6642\u9593\u300d", "\u300c\u7c73\u56fd\u3068UK\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u898f\u683c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u304a\u8336\u306e\u714e\u308c\u65b9\u300d"]}

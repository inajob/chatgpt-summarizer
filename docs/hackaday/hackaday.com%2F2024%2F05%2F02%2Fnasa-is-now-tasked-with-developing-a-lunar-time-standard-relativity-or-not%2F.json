Its a complicated issue, because on Earth, time is all about the Sun and our local relationship with it. The Moon and the Sun have their own weird thing going on, so time there doesnt really line up well with our terrestrial conception of it.\nNevertheless, as humanity gets serious about doing Moon things again, the issue needs to be solved. To that end, NASA has now officially been tasked with setting up Moon time  just a few short weeks after we last talked about it! (Does the President read Hackaday?) Only problem is, physics is going to make it a damn sight more complicated!\n\nRelatively Speaking\nYou know its serious when the White House sends you a memo. Tell NASA to invent lunar time, and get off their fannies!\nThe problem is all down to general and special relativity. The Moon is in motion relative to Earth, and it also has a lower gravitational pull. We wont get into the physics here, but it basically means that time literally moves at a different pace up there. Time on the Moon passes on average 58.7 microseconds faster over a 24 hour Earth day. Its not constant, either\u2014there is a certain degree of periodic variation involved.\nIts a tiny difference, but its cumulative over time. Plus, as it is, many space and navigational applications need the utmost in precise timing to function, so its not something NASA can ignore. Even if the agency just wanted to just use UTC and call it good, the relativity problem would prevent that from being a workable solution.\nWithout a reliable and stable timebase, space agencies like NASA would struggle to establish useful infrastructure on the Moon. Things like lunar satellite navigation wouldnt work accurately without taking into account the time slip, for example. GPS is highly sensitive to relativistic time effects, and indeed relies upon them to function. Replicating it on the Moon is only possible if these factors are accounted for. Looking even further ahead, things like lunar commerce or secure communication would be difficult to manage reliably without stable timebases for equipment involved.\nBanks of atomic clocks\u2014like these at the US Naval Observatory\u2014are used to establish high-quality time standards. Similar equipment may need to be placed on the Moon to establish Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC). Credit: public domain\nStill, the order to find a solution has come down from the top. A memo from the Executive Office of the President charged NASA with its task to deliver a standard solution for lunar timing by December 31, 2026.\u00a0 Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC) must be established and in a way that is traceable to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). That will enable operators on Earth to synchronize operations with crews or unmanned systems on the Moon itself. LTC is required to be accurate enough for scientific and navigational purposes, and it must be resilient to any loss of contact with systems back on Earth.\nIts also desired that the future LTC standard will be extensible and scalable to space environments we may explore in future beyond the Earth-Moon system itself. In time, NASA may find it necessary to establish time standards for other celestial bodies, due to their own unique differences in relative velocity and gravitational field.\nThe deadline means theres time for NASA to come up with a plan to tackle the problem. However, for a federal agency, less than two years is not exactly a lengthy time frame. Its likely that whatever NASA comes up with will involve some kind of timekeeping equipment deployed on the Moon itself. This equipment would thus be subject to the time shift relative to Earth, making it easier to track differences in time between the lunar and terrestrial time-realities.\nThe US Naval Observatory doesnt just keep careful track of time, it displays it on a big LED display for people in the area. NASA probably doesnt need to establish a big time billboard on the Moon, but itd be cool if they did.

Think of the atomic clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory\u2014theyre the heartbeat of the nation, synchronizing everything, he said in an interview. Youre going to want a heartbeat on the moon.\nFor now, establishing CLT remains a project for the American space agency. It will work on the project in partnership with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, State and Transportation. One fears for the public servants required to coordinate meetings amongst all those departments.\nEstablishing new time standards isnt cheap. It requires smart minds, plenty of research and development, and some serious equipment. Space-rated atomic clocks dont come cheap, either. Regardless, the U.S. government hopes that NASA will lead the way for all spacefaring nations in this regard, setting a lunar time standard that can serve future operations well.\n"}

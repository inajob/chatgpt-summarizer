While not exclusive to the hacker community, a bunch of us are also \u201ctool-building mammals\u201d when we have the need or get the free time. I initially wanted to try to draw some distinction between the two modes, but honestly I think all good hackers do both, all the time.\nWe were talking about the cool variety of test probes on the podcast, inspired by Al Williams\u2019 piece on back probes. Sometimes you need something that\u2019s needle-thin and can sneak into a crimp socket, and other times you need something that can hold on like alligator clips. The infinite variety of jigs and holders that make it easier to probe tiny pins is nothing short of amazing. Some of these are made, and others bought. You do what you can, and you do what you need to.\nYou can learn a lot from looking at the professional gear, but you can learn just as much from looking at other hackers\u2019 bodge jobs. In the podcast, I mentioned one of my favorite super-low-tech hacks: making a probe holder out of a pair of pliers and a rubber band to hold them closed. Lean this contraption onto the test point in question and gravity does the rest. I can\u2019t even remember where I learned this trick from, but I honestly use it more than the nice indicator-arm contraptions that I built for the same purpose. It\u2019s the immediacy and lack of fuss, I think.\nSo what\u2019s your favorite way of putting the probe on the point? Home-made and improvised, or purpose-built and professional? Or both?

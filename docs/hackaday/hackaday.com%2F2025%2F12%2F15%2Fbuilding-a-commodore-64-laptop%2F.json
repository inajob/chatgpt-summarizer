This is the question that [Kevin Noki] tried to recently answer with a custom C64 laptop build.\nWhile technically you could argue that Commodores SX-64 could be construed as a portable system, its bulky format ensured that it was only portable in the sense that a 1980s CRT-based oscilloscope is also portable. Sadly, this turned out to be the last real attempt by Commodore to make a portable non-PC compatible system, with the ill-fated Commodore LCD project never making it out of development. We can, however, glean from this some design hints of what Commodores designers had in mind.\nInterestingly, [Kevin] decided to instead use the Macintosh Portable as inspiration, with adaptations to make it look more like a breadbin C64. One could have argued that the C64Cs design would have worked better. Regardless, an enclosure was 3D printed, with parts glued together and metal dowels added for support.\nFor the guts, a custom keyboard with a new PCB and FDM printed keycaps was used, with a Raspberry Pi Pico as keyboard controller. We would here cue the jokes about how the keyboard controller is more powerful than a C64, but the real brains of this laptop come in the form of a Raspberry Pi 5 SBC for running the Vice C64 emulator, which blows a C64 even further out of the water.\nThis choice also means theres no direct compatibility with genuine C64 peripherals, but a workaround involving many adaptors and more MCUs was implemented. Sadly, cartridge compatibility was sacrificed due to these complications. The resulting innards can be glimpsed in the above screenshot to give some idea of what the end result looks like.\nOf course, this isnt the first time a Commodore 64 laptop has been created; [Ben Heck] used a C64C mainboard and an original keyboard back in 2009. This meant direct compatibility with all peripherals, including cartridges. Hopefully, now that Commodore as a company has been revived, it will pick up on ideas like these, as an FPGA-based C64 or C128 laptop would be pretty rad.\nThanks to [fluffy] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eC64\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u3082\u3057\u3082\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3089", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eC64\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u6a5f\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eC64\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u3082\u3057\u3082\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3089", "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0C64\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044C64\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u907a\u7269\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306eC64\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- Commodore\u304c\u63cf\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

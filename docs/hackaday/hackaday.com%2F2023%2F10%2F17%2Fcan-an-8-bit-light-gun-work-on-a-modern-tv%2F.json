One of the reason for this is usually cited as being because the frame buffer and scaler circuit necessary for driving an LCD panel induces a delay not present on the original, and in particular this makes playing games which relied on a light gun impossible to play. Its a subject [Nicole Branagan] takes a look at, and asks whether there are any ways to use a classic light gun with a modern TV.\nAlong the way were treated to an in-depth look at the tech behind light gun games, how the gun contained a photodiode which on the NES was triggered by the brief showing of a frame with a white square where the target would sit, and on the Sega consoles by a white screen with an on-board timer counting the screen position at which the gun was aimed.\nThe conclusion is that the delay means you wont be playing Duck Hunt or Hogans Alley on your 4K TV, but interestingly, all is not lost. There are modified versions of the games that take account of the delay, or an interesting lightgun emulator using a WiiMote. Wed be happy at playing either way, just as long as we can take pot-shots at the annoying Duck Hunt dog.\nLight gun image: Evan-Amos, Public domain."}

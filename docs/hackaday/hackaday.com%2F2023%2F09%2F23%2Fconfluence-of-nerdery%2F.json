Who knows when that knowledge of stenography, ancient retrocomputing, and floppy disk internals will all combine to get someone falsely accused out of jail? Go read this story and come on back, but the short version is that [Bloop Museum] helped recover some 40+ year old court evidence off of some floppies to right an old wrong.\nIf you looked at the combination of extremely geeky topics, you\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely to find anyone well versed in any one of them, and you\u2019d say that the chances of anyone knowing enough in each these fringe domains to be helpful is exceedingly low. But I\u2019m absolutely sure that the folks at [Bloop Museum] had some more to throw into the mix if they were called for. Or better yet, they might know exactly the right geeks to call in.\nAnd that\u2019s the other heartwarming part of the story. When [Bloop Museum] didn\u2019t know everything about old stenography formats, they knew the right people to reach out to \u2013 the Plover open stenography project. Who is going to know more? Nobody! Together, the nerd community is an unstoppable resource.\nSo remember, when you\u2019re hanging out with your geek friends, to keep a running catalog of everyone\u2019s interests. Because you never know when you\u2019re going to need an expert in re-gilding frames, or relocating bee hives, or restoring 1930\u2019s radio sets. Or decoding obscure data formats to get someone out of jail.\nHackaday Halloween\nWe\u2019re running the 2023 Halloween Hackfest and it\u2019s your chance to document your Halloween projects, and win fame, fortune, or at least one of three $150 DigiKey gift certificates, plus some Arduino schwag courtesy of the contest\u2019s sponsors!

If you want the gory details check out the video embedded blow and there is a first class write-up available as a 78 page PDF manual too. Indeed it has been a while since we have seen a project which was this well documented.\nA typical drum machine will have many buttons and LEDs and is usually implemented with a microcontroller. In this project [Moritz] eschews that complexity and comes up with an analog solution using a few integrated circuits, LEDs, and buttons.\nThe heart of the build are the integrated circuits which include two TL074 quad op amps, a TL072 dual op amp, a CD4520 binary counter, and eight CD4015 shift registers. Fifteen switches and buttons are used along with seven LEDs. And speaking of LEDs, our hacker [Moritz] seems to have an LED schematic symbol tattooed to his hand, and we dont know about you, but this screams credibility to us! :)\n\nThis capable drum machine includes a bunch of features, including: 4 independent channels with one-button step input/removal; up to 16 steps per channel; optional half-time mode per channel; two synchronizable analog low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) for dynamic accents; resistor-DAC output for pitch or decay modulation; and an internal clock with 16th, 8th, and quarter note outputs, which can be synchronized with external gear.\nOf course at Hackaday weve seen plenty of drum machines before.

It enabled pictures to be unloaded wirelessly to social media with minimum hassle, which back then wasnt quite as easily accomplished as it is today. Sadly they shuttered the service in 2021, leaving that generation of cameras, like so many connected devices, orphaned. Now along comes [Ge0rG] with a replacement, replicating the API on a $20 LTE dongle.\nThe dongle in question is one we featured a couple of years ago, packing a Linux-capable computer of similar power to a Raspberry Pi Zero alongside its cell modem. The camera can connect to the device, and a photo can be sent in a Mastodon post. Its something of a modern version of the original, but for owners of the affected cameras its a useful recovery of a lost service.\nIts surprising in a way that weve not heard more of these dongles, as they do represent a useful opportunity. That we havent should be seen as a measure of the success of the Raspberry Pi and other boards like it, just as its no longer worth hacking old routers for Linux hardware projects, so theres less of a need to do the same here.", "title": "Samsung\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306eSNS\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bLTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb", "body": "2010\u5e74\u9803\u3001Samsung\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306bSNS\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5199\u771f\u3092\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306b\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3057\u305f\u30022021\u5e74\u306b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3057\u3001[Ge0rG]\u304c$20\u306eLTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3067\u4ee3\u66ffAPI\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u30d0\u30c4\u30d0\u30c4\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u6709\u76ca\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u3002", "titles": ["Samsung\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306eSNS\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bLTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb", "$20\u306eLTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3067\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u5fa9\u5143", "\u53e4\u3044Samsung\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u547d\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "LTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a", "Raspberry Pi\u306b\u5339\u6575\u3059\u308b\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u6301\u3064LTE\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb"]}

They\u2019re totally an igneous process, though, and so were presented in the article on magmatic ore processes.\nFor the most part, you can think of the various hydrothermal ore formation processes as being metamorphic in nature. That is, the fluids are causing alteration to existing rock formations; this is especially true of skarns.\nThere\u2019s a third leg to that rock tripod, though: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Are there sedimentary rocks that happen to be ores? You betcha! In fact, one sedimentary process holds the most valuable ores on Earth\u2013 and as usual, it\u2019s not likely to be restricted to this planet alone.\nPlacer? I hardly know \u2018er!\nWe\u2019re talking about placer deposits, which means we\u2019re talking about gold. In dollar value, gold\u2019s great expense means that these deposits are amongst the most valuable on Earth\u2013 and nearly half of the world\u2019s gold has come out of just one of them. Gold isn\u2019t the only mineral that can be concentrated in placer deposits, to be clear; it\u2019s just the one everyone cares about these days, because, well, have you seen the spot price lately?\nOof. Data from Goldprice.org\nSince we\u2019re talking about sediments, as you might guess, this is a secondary process: the gold has to already be emplaced by one of the hydrothermal ore processes. Then the usual erosion happens: wind and water breaks down the rock, and gold gets swept downhill along with all the other little bits of rock on their way to becoming sediments. Gold, however, is much denser than silicate rocks. That\u2019s the key here: any denser material is naturally going to be sorted out in a flow of grains. To be specific, empirical data shows that anything denser than 2.87 g/cm3 can be concentrated in a placer deposit. That would qualify a lot of the sulfide minerals the hydrothermal processes like to throw up, but unfortunately sulfides tend to be both too soft and too chemically unstable to hold up to the weathering to form placer deposits, at least on Earth since cyanobacteria polluted the atmosphere with O2.\nDry? Check. Windswept? Check. Aeolian placer deposits? Maybe!Image: MSL Sunset Dunes Mosaic, NASA/JPL and Olivier de Goursac\nOne form of erosion is from wind, which tends to be important in dry regions \u2013 particularly the deserts of Australia and the Western USA. Wind erosion can also create placer deposits, which get called \u201caeolian placers\u201d. The mechanism is fairly straightforward: lighter grains of sand are going to blow further, concentrating the heavy stuff on one side of a dune or closer to the original source rock. Given the annual global dust storms, aeolian placers may come up quite often on Mars, but the thin atmosphere might make this process less likely than you\u2019d think.\nWe\u2019ve also seen rockslides on Mars, and material moving in this matter is subject to the same physics. In a flow of grains, you\u2019re going to have buoyancy and the heavy stuff is going to fall to the bottom and stop sooner. If the lighter material is further carried away by wind or water, we call the resulting pile of useful, heavy rock an effluvial placer deposit.\nStill, on this planet at least it\u2019s usually water doing the moving of sediments, and it\u2019s water that\u2019s doing the sortition. Heavy grains fall out of suspension in water more easily. This tends to happen wherever flow is disrupted: at the base of a waterfall, at a river bend, or where a river empties into a lake or the ocean. Any old Klondike or California prospector would know that that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to go panning for gold, but you probably wouldn\u2019t catch a 49er calling it an \u201cAlluvial placer deposit\u201d. Panning itself is using the exact same physics\u2013 that\u2019s why it, along with the fancy modern sluices people use with powered pumps, are called \u201cplacer mining\u201d. Marss dry river beds may be replete with alluvial placers; so might the deltas on Titan, though on a world where water is part of the bedrock, the cryo-mineralogy would be very unfamiliar to Earthly geologists.\nBack here on earth, wave action, with the repeated reversal of flow, is great at sorting grains. There aren\u2019t any gold deposits on beaches these days because wherever theyve been found, they were mined out very quickly.\u00a0 But there are many beaches where black magnetite sand has been concentrated due to its higher density to quartz. If your beach does not have magnetite, look at the grain size: even quartz grains can often get sorted by size on wavy beaches. Apparently this idea came after scientists lost their fascination with latin, as this type of deposit is referred to simply as a \u201cbeach placer\u201d rather than a \u201clittoral placer\u201d.\nKondike, eat your heart out: Fifty thousand tonnes of this stuff has come out of the mines of Witwatersrand.\nWhile we in North America might think of the Klondike or California gold rushes\u2013 both of which were sparked by placer deposits\u2013 the largest gold field in the world was actually in South Africa: the Witwatersrand Basin. Said basin is actually an ancient lake bed, Archean in origin\u2013 about three billion years old. For 260 million years or thereabouts, sediments accumulated in this lake, slowly filling it up. Those sediments were being washed out from nearby mountains that housed orogenic gold deposits. The lake bed has served to concentrate that ancient gold even further, and it\u2019s produced a substantial fraction of the gold metal ever extracted\u2013 depending on the source, you\u2019ll see numbers from as high as 50% to as low as 22%. Either way, that\u2019s a lot of gold.\nWitwatersrand is a bit of an anomaly; most placer deposits are much smaller than that. Indeed, that\u2019s in part why you\u2019ll find placer deposits only mined for truly valuable minerals like gold and gems, particularly diamonds. Sure, the process can concentrate magnetite, but it\u2019s not usually worth the effort of stripping a beach for iron-rich sand.\nThe most common non-precious exception is uraninite, UO2, a uranium ore found in Archean-age placer deposits. As you might imagine, the high proportion of heavy uranium makes it a dense enough mineral to form placer deposits. I must specify Archean-age, however, because an oxygen atmosphere tends to further oxidize the uraninite into more water-soluble forms, and it gets washed to sea instead of forming deposits. On Earth, it seems there are no uraninite placers dated to after the Great Oxygenation; you wouldnt have that problem on Mars, and the dry river beds of the red planet may well have pitchblende reserves enough for a Martian rendition of Uranium Fever.\nIf you were the Martian, would you rather find uranium or gold in those river bends?Image: Nandes Valles valley system, ESA/DLR/FU Berlin\nWhile uranium is produced at Witwatersrand as a byproduct of the gold mines, uranium ore can be deposited exclusively of gold. You can see that with the alluvial deposits in Canada, around Elliot Lake in Ontario, which produced millions of pounds of the uranium without a single fleck of gold, thanks to a bend in a three-billion-year-old riverbed. From a dollar-value perspective, a gold mine might be worth more, but the uranium probably did more for civilization.\nLateritization, or Why Martians Can\u2019t Have Pop Cans\nSpeaking of useful for civilization, there\u2019s another type of process acting on the surface to give us ores of less noble metals than gold. It is not mechanical, but chemical, and given that it requires hot, humid conditions with lots of water, it\u2019s almost certainly restricted to Sol 3. As the subtitle gives it away, this process is called \u201clateritization\u201d and is responsible for the only economical aluminum deposits out there, along with a significant amount of the world\u2019s nickel reserves.\nThe process is fairly simple: in the hot tropics, ample rainfall will slowly leech any mobile ions out of clay soils. Ions like sodium and potassium are first to go, followed by calcium and magnesium but if the material is left on the surface long enough, and the climate stays hot and wet, chemical weathering will eventually strip away even the silica. The resulting \u201cLaterite\u201d rock (or clay) is rich in iron, aluminum, and sometimes nickel and/or copper. Nickel laterites are particularly prevalent in New Caledonia, where they form the basis of that island\u2019s mining industry. Aluminum-rich laterites are called bauxite, and are the source of all Earth\u2019s aluminum, found worldwide. More ancient laterites are likely to be found in solid form, compressed over time into sedimentary rock, but recent deposits may still have the consistency of dirt. For obvious reasons, those recent deposits tend to be preferred as cheaper to mine.\nThat red dirt is actually aluminum ore, from a 1980s-era operation on the island of Jamaica. Image from \u201cBauxite\u201d by Paul Morris, CC BY-SA 2.0\nWhen we talk about a \u201cwarm and wet\u201d period in Martian history, we\u2019re talking about the existence of liquid water on the surface of the planet\u2013 we are notably not talking about tropical conditions. Mars was likely never the kind of place you\u2019d see lateritization, so it\u2019s highly unlikely we will ever find bauxite on the surface of Mars. Thus future Martians will have to make due without Aluminum pop cans. Of course, iron is available in abundance there and weighs about the same as the equivalent volume of aluminum does here on Earth, so they\u2019ll probably do just fine without it.\nMost nickel has historically come from sulfide melt deposits rather than lateralization, even on Earth, so the Martians should be able to make their steel stainless. Given the ambitions some have for a certain stainless-steel rocket, that\u2019s perhaps comforting to hear.\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize, as this series comes to a close, that I\u2019m only providing a very surface-level understanding of these surface level processes\u2013 and, indeed, of all the ore formation processes we\u2019ve discussed in these posts. Entire monographs could be, and indeed have been written about each one. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising, considering the depths of knowledge modern science generates. You could do an entire doctorate studying just one aspect of one of the processes we\u2019ve talked about in this series; people have in the past, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. So if you\u2019ve found these articles interesting, and are sad to see the series end\u2013 don\u2019t worry! There\u2019s a lot left to learn; you just have to go after it yourself.\nPlus, I\u2019m not going anywhere. At some point there are going to be more rock-related words published on this site. If you havent seen it before, check out Hackadays long-running Mining and Refining series. Its not focused on the ores\u2013 more on what we humans do with them\u2013but if youve read this far, its likely to appeal to you as well.\n"}

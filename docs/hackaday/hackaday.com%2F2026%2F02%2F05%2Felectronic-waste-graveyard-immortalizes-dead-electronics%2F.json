While these corporations have forgotten their products, the US PIRG Education Fund has immortalized them in their Electronic Waste Graveyard.\nWith an estimated 130,000,000 pounds of electronic waste produced since 2014, the amount of wasted resources is staggering. The advent of the cloud promised us reduced waste as lightweight devices could rely on remote brains to keep the upgrades going long after a traditional device would have been unable to keep up. The opposite seems to have occurred, wreaking havoc on the environment and pocketbooks.\nOf course, we can count on hackers to circumvent the end of companies or services, but while that gives us plenty of fodder for projects, it isnt so great for the normal folks who make up the rest of the population. We appreciate PIRG giving such a visceral reminder of the cost of business-as-usual for those who arent always thinking about material usage and waste.\nIf PIRG sounds familiar, theyre one of the many groups keeping an eye on Right-to-Repair legislation. Weve been keeping an eye on it too with places like the EU, Texas, and Washington moving the ball forward on reducing e-waste and keeping devices running longer."}

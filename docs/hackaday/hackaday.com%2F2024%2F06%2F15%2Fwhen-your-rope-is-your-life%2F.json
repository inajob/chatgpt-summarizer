And while theres been tremendous progress in climbing rope tech since people first started falling onto hemp fibers, there are still accidents where rope failure is to blame.\nThis long, detailed, and interesting video from [Hard is Easy] follows him on a trip to the Mammut test labs to see whats up with their relatively new abrasion-resistant rope. His visit was full of cool engineering test rigs that pushed the ropes to breaking in numerous ways. If you climb, though, be warned that some of the scenes are gut-wrenchingly fascinating, watching the ropes fail horribly in well-shot slow-mo.\n\nLong story short, some climbing ropes are strong but stiff. These are called static ropes, and theyre rated to hold a given weight, and tested to breaking under a static load. The thinnest and strongest static ropes are made of Kevlar, and they are correspondingly very abrasion resistant, but they hurt to fall into.\nDynamic climbing ropes have some stretch, and are rated both for how gently they let you down and their maximum breaking force. These are mostly made of nylon, and they are tested by dropping a mass with an accelerometer onto a slack rope  a pretty good simulation of falling back off of a flat face like at the climbing gym.\nNow what if you wanted an abrasion resistant dynamic rope? A couple of manufacturers have created custom Kevlar-nylon filaments where the Kevlar is wrapped loosely around the nylon. This filament is abrasion resistant because of the Kevlar, but gives like a nylon rope because the Kevlar fibers have slack built in.\nTesting these ropes involved creating a custom test that drops a mass onto the rope, but pulls it across a 45-degree granite edge as it falls. These tests absolutely shred the normal nylon dynamic ropes, but the Kevlar-reinforced ropes held fast. Theyre both fun and terrifying to watch.\nWeve said it before, and its said a number of times in this video: you cant improve what you cant measure. In this context, its a little sobering is that there isnt an industry standard test for abrasion resistance, but its cool to see the Mammut folks working on it.\n<!--more-->\n"}

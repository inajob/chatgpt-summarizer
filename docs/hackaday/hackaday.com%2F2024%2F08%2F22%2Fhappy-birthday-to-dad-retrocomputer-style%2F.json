But as this bit-banged TRS-80 birthday bonus pack shows, the first generation did a pretty good job passing the retro torch.\nWith his fathers 70th birthday coming up and full of borrowed nostalgia for the good old days, [Josh Sucher] scored a TRS-80 off eBay and experimented with what could be possible. After 50-odd years, the machine needed a bit of TLC, including a new power supply, some keyboard repairs, and the usual recapping. He also had to soup the machine up a bit, given that its original capabilities were so limited.\nChief among these mods was a rudimentary IP stack thanks to a TRS-IO card, which emulates a lot of functionality of the original TRS-80 Expansion Module and adds an ESP-32 for WiFi capability. This allowed [Josh] to get a neat Dadbot chatbot going on the machine, using years of his dads text messages to train the model. Theres also a game of Go, an RPG based on his parents lives, and a local news and weather app. Most impressive, though, is the bit-banged audio app that uses the TRS-80s cassette interface to play a passable rendition of Happy Birthday to You. The video below has the full demo.\nIts clear that this lengthy project was a labor of love, and we approve of the results. Its been a long, long time since we first caught wind of the TRS-80 through the Radio Shack catalog, and projects like this make us feel like scratching up one for ourselves to play with.\n\n\n[via Hacker News]", "title": "TRS-80\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30cd\u30aa\u30fb\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "TRS-80\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u304c70\u6b73\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3001TLC\u3084\u6539\u826f\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3001WiFi\u6a5f\u80fd\u3084\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u6614\u306e\u65e5\u3092\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3080\u611f\u899a\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30fc\u3092\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308b\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["TRS-80\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30cd\u30aa\u30fb\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "TRS-80\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u3063\u305fDadbot\uff1a\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "TRS-80\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\uff1a\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "TRS-80\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u3001\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a5\u7d9a\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "TRS-80\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\uff1a\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u606f\u5439"]}

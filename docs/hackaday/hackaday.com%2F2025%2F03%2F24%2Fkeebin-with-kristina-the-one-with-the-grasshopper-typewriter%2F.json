Meet the glass keyboard by [BranchNo9329], which even has a glass PCB. At least, I think the whole thing is glass.\nImage via [BranchNo9329] via redditThere are so frustratingly few details that this might as well have been a centerfold, but I thought you all should see it just the same. What we do have are several pictures and a couple of really short videos, so dive in.\nI can tell you that [BranchNo2939] chose a glass substrate mainly due to curiosity about its durability compared with FR4. And that the copper circuitry was applied with physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology.\nApparently one of [BranchNo2939]s friends is researching the bonding of copper on to glass panels, so they thought theyd give a keyboard a go. Right now the thing is incomplete  apparently theres going to be RGB. Because of course theres going to be RGB.\nerkbd Can Be yrkbd, Too\nErik + Keyboard = erkbd, and now [EarflapsOpen]s wide split is open-source and now has a\u00a0fully documented build guide on GitHub by special request.\nImage by [EarflapsOpen] via redditInspired mostly by the Corne and the Void Ergo S layout, this is a 44-key, hand-wired number that runs on a pair of Waveshare RP2040 Zeros programmed with QMK.\nI really like the inclusion of OLEDs and rotary encoders, although I feel I would inadvertently turn them by accident. Maybe not. At the very least, they appear to be taller than the keys and might get in the way.\n[EarflapsOpen] addresses this a bit at the bottom of the reddit thread, stating that they are not in the way when typing. But since they are kind of far from the home row, you have to move your entire hand to use them. Currently, [EarflapsOpen] uses them for scrolling, adjusting volume, video scrubbing, and so on.\nThe Centerfold: Battle Axes\nImage by [delusionalreddit] via redditSo perhaps [delusionalreddit]s setup is a bit of a departure from the regular centerfold material, but thats okay. Just look at all those guitars! Yours truly is down to just six or so, and really ought to have them situated similarly around the laboratory. Maybe someday.\nSo there isnt much detail here, especially about the peripherals, and I apologize for that. Please see the next paragraph. Almost no one sends me centerfolds! You know your keeb is sexy; now get it out there.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Williams\nWhen the people demand some new advancement in technology, the early response by manufacturers can sometimes be less than appealing, visually speaking.\nA Williams No. 1 model. Image by The Antikey Chop\nThis is not the case with the stunning Williams line of\u00a0 typewriters, which were developed in response to heavy demand for visible typewriters  machines that let the typist see what was being typed without having to stop and do something first. Of course, you could only see a few lines at a time, and just by peering over the tippy-top of the machine, but this was revolutionary.\nForm follows function in these lovely machines, which dont seem to waste an inch of space on frivolity. To create visibility, the Williams typewriters had the platen situated in the center, between two sets of type bars that struck from the front and rear, kicking like grasshopper legs. The paper is first secured along the top and curled downward into the basket.\nDont quite understand? Dont blame you. Check out this short video, which demonstrates how to insert paper and type on a Williams Academy model.\n\nIsnt that cool? The earliest Williams models like the No. 1 pictured above became available in 1891. The keyboard was curved slightly, and the body featured Victorian-inspired filigree. Beginning in 1895, the No. 1 was manufactured with a straight keyboard.\u00a0The No. 2 came out in 1897 and were nearly identical to the straight-keyboarded No. 1s, but they got an upgrade in the form of typebar alignment. No. 2s were also called Academy like the one in the video, or Englewood.\nInventor John Williams was quite the character and inventor, and was known to rub elbows with Alexander Graham Bell and Emile Berliner. He patented all kinds of things, from cigar cutters to one of the first helicopters in 1912. Unfortunately, the Williams Typewriter Company was fairly short-lived, as they were in litigation for patent infringement pretty much the whole time, until 1909. They were acquired by Jerome Burgess Secor, who would go on to produce a completely different typewriter. Stay tuned!\nFinally, Another Use for All Those Melty Beads\nSo [humanplayer2] was having some fun last Saturday while his daughter played with those melty beads. After some trial and error, it seems we have a new viable switch plate material!\nImage by [humanplayer2] via redditThe trial and error was, of course, about finding out what inner bead configuration would result in the snuggest fit. As it turns out, a plain old open square holds them the best, followed by hand-cut-away corners, then full interiors.\nFor what its worth, [humanplayer2] was using Hama beads specifically, which is why the holes are almost all completely melted shut.\nKeep in mind that not all melty beads are created equally, so your mileage may vary depending on what youve got. But it probably shouldnt matter too-too much in this case, unless you use the ones that are supposed to be really terrible.\nBe sure to check out the custom Hama bead game pad he made for her so she can play Paw Patrol in style.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

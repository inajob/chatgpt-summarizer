But this is Hackaday, after all. This solar-powered card reminds the recipient to send [Dead Rat Productions] an email by beeping about every two hours, although the gist of that email may simply be begging them to make it stop, provided they didnt just toss the thing in the garbage.\nThe full-on, working version of the card is not intended for everyone  mostly serious-looking A-list types that ooze wealth. Most of [Dead Rat Productions] pub mates will get an unpopulated version, which could be a fun afternoon for the right kind of recipient, of course.\nThat person would need a Seeed Studio Xiao SAMD21, a solar panel, plus some other components, like an energy-harvesting chip to keep the battery topped up. Of note, there is a coin cell holder that requires prying with a screwdriver to get the battery out, so theres really no escaping the beeping without some work on their part. We rather like the artwork on this one, especially the fact that the coin cell sits inside the rats stomach. Thats a nice touch.\n \n\n"}

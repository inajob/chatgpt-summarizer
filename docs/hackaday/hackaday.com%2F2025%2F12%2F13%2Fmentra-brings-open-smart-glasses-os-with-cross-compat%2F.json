Todays highlight is [Mentra], who is releasing an open-source smart glasses OS for their own and others devices, letting you develop your smart glasses ideas just once, a single codebase applicable for multiple models.\nCurrently, the compatibility list covers four models, two of them Mentras (Live and Mach 1), one from Vuzix (Z100), and one from Even Realities (G1)  some display-only, and some recording-only. The app store already has a few apps that cover the basics, the repository looks lively, and if the openness is anything to go by, our guess is that were sure to see more.\n\nWhile smart glasses have their critics, many of those stem from closed-source software running on them, so the ability to easily develop your own is always welcome, and its even better to see it done in an open, cross-compatible manner.

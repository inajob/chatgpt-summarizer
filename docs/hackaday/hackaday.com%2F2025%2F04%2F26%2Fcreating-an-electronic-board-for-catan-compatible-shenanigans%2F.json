Specifically, an electronic strategy boardgame that is miraculously also compatible with Settlers of Catan.\n[Seans] game is called Calculus. Its about mining asteroids and bartering. Youre playing as a corporation attempting to mine the asteroid against up to three others doing the same. Do a good job of exploiting the space-based resource, and youll win the game.\nCalculus is played on a board made out of PCBs. A Xiao RP2040 microcontroller board on the small PCB in the center of the playfield is responsible for running the show. It controls a whole ton of seven-segment displays and RGB LEDs across multiple PCBs that make up the gameboard. The lights and displays help players track the game state as they vie for asteroid mining supremacy. Amusingly, by virtue of its geometry and some smart design choices, you can also use [Sean]s board to play Settlers of Catan. Hes even designed a smaller, cheaper travel version, too.\nWe do see some interesting board games around these parts, because hackers and makers are just that creative. If youve got your own board game hacks or builds in the works, dont hesitate to let us know!", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cCalculus\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Sean Boyce\u306f\u3001\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u63a1\u6398\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u6226\u7565\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cCalculus\u300d\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cCalculus\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u63a1\u6398\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306b\u3057\u305f\u6226\u7565\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- PCB\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- RGB LED\u3068\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u9032\u884c\u72b6\u6cc1\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316", "- \u300c\u30ab\u30bf\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u62d3\u8005\u305f\u3061\u300d\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

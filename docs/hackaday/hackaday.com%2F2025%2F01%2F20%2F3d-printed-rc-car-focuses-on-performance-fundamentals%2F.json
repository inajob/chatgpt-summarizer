However, sometimes you just have to go your own way. Thats what [snamle] did with this awesome 3D-printed RC car\u2014and the results are impressive.\nThis build didnt just aim to build something that looked vaguely car-like and whizzed around on the ground. Instead, it was intended to give [snamle] the opporunity to explore the world of vehicle dynamics\u2014learning about weight distribution, suspension geometry, and so many other factors\u2014and how these all feed into the handling of a vehicle. The RC side of things is all pretty straightforward\u2014transmitter, receiver, servos, motors, and a differential were all off-the-shelf. But the chassis design, the steering, and suspension are all bespoke\u2014designed by [snamle] to create a car with good on-road handling and grip.\nIts a small scale testbed, to be sure. Regardless, theres no better way to learn about how a vehicle works on a real, physical level\u2014you cant beat building one with your own two hands and figuring out how it works.\nIts true, we see a lot of 3D printed RC cars around these parts. Many are built with an eye to robotics experimentation or simply as a learning exercise. This one stands out for its focus on handling and performance, and of course that nicely-designed suspension system. Video after the break.\n\n"}

Stick welders have become a commodity and even some that use shield gas are cheap if you dont count buying the bottle of gas. But plasma cutters are still a bit pricey. Can you get one from China for under $300? Yes. Do you want one that cheap? [Metal Massacre Fab Shop] answers that question in the video below.\nFirst impressions count, and having plasma misspelled on the unit (plasme) isnt promising. The instructions were unclear, and some of the fittings didnt make him happy, so he replaced them with some he had on hand. He also added some pipe tape to stop any leaking.\nThe first test was a piece of quarter-inch steel at 35 amps. The machine itself is rated to 50 amps. Sparks ensued, and with a little boost in amperage, it made a fair-looking cut. At 50 amps, it was time to try a thicker workpiece. It made the cut, although it wasnt beautiful. The leaking regulator and the fact that he cant run the compressor simultaneously as the cutter didnt help.\nFrom the look of it, for light duty, this would be workable with a little practice and maybe some new fittings. Unsurprisingly, it probably isnt as capable as a professional unit. Still could be very handy to have.\nIt is possible to convert a welder into a plasma cutter. A handheld unit like this probably wont benefit from a Sharpie.\n\n", "title": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e300\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "body": "\u6e96\u5099\u304c\u6574\u3063\u305f\u5de5\u623f\u306b\u306f\u6eb6\u63a5\u6a5f\u304c\u5099\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u5207\u65ad\u6a5f\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306f300\u30c9\u30eb\u672a\u6e80\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002\u6eb6\u63a5\u6a5f\u3092\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u306e300\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\uff1f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u81ea\u4f5c\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3084\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u3069\u3046\uff1f", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u521d\u8a66\u9a13\uff1a\u4f7f\u3044\u5fc3\u5730\u3084\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u3092\u691c\u8a3c", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306eDIY\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

Cheap outdoor solar lights are more than just garden accessories; theyre a handy source of waterproof enclosures, solar panels and batteries. This is demonstrated by [Tavis], who turned one such light into a Meshtastic LoRa communication node.\nWhere theres an antenna, theres a radio\nA nice feature on this specific $15 Harbor Breeze Solar LED is the roomy solar panel enclosure with integrated 18650 battery holder, allowing for easy battery swaps. [Tavis] was able to easily fit the RAKwireless modular dev board, and wire it into the lights charging circuit. The cheap\u00a0 circuit is likely not the most efficient, but will probably get the job done. Its always possible to just swap it out with a better charging board. [Tavis] also added an external antenna by using a panel-mount SMA pigtail connector.\nThe Meshtastic project is all about enabling text-only communications through LoRa-based mesh networks, built using off-the-shelf devices and development boards that wont break the bank. The project has seen some incredible growth, with people all over the world setting up their own networks.\nIts not the first time weve seen garden lights get used in project. Weve seen MQTT added to a PIR solar light with some clever power saving circuitry, and as a power source for Attiny85-based projects.", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u901a\u4fe1\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u5c4b\u5916\u7528\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u9632\u6c34\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u6e90\u3068\u306a\u308b\u3002[Tavis]\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066LoRa\u901a\u4fe1\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u4f5c\u901a\u4fe1\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u304a\u5f97\u306a\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3088\u3046", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u9632\u6c34\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046", "Meshtastic LoRa\u901a\u4fe1\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

About six months after starting, he had this glorious thing completed. Its a hardware version of a game called Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes where players have five minutes to defuse a suitcase bomb. This implementation requires at least two players, one with the box-bomb itself, and one who holds all the knowledge but cant see the box-bomb to defuse it.\nThe wiring of the Mastermind module.\n[Heath]s version has twice as many modules as the original game, each hand-wired one driven by an Arduino. One of the modules is an LED maze. There are two green anchor LEDs in one of six configurations, and and blue and a red LED.\nThe object is to move the blue LED next to the red one without touching any walls. Of course, the box-holder cant see the walls and must describe the configuration of the anchor LEDs to their partner in order to get started.\nAll of the modules are quite different, which likely makes for an extremely fun and challenging five minutes. [Heath] reports that getting inter-module communication down was a long road. Eventually, [Heath] settled on a mesh network configuration and connected everything in a big loop. Be sure to check out the walk-through video after the break.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen a hardware implementation of this game. Heres one that uses a Raspberry Pi.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7248\u300cKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u53cb\u9054\u3092\u9a5a\u304b\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8131\u51fa\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u98a8\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u5168\u3066\u304cArduino\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u9593\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u306b\u306f\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a18\u4e8b\u5185\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u8981\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7248\u300cKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u53cb\u9054\u3092\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u3055\u305b\u308b", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306b\u3088\u308b5\u5206\u9593\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u8131\u51fa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u300cKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes\u300d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5fe0\u5b9f\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5316"]}

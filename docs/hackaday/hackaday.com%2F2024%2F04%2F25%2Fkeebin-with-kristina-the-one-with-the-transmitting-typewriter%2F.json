In fact, its more than fine, its probably the cutest lil ZX Spectrum youll see today.\n[SrBlonde]s wonderful micro Spectrum project has only the essential inputs, which makes for an interesting-looking keyboard for sure. Inside youll find an Orange Pi Zero 2 board loaded with Batocera so [SrBlonde] can play all their favorite childhood games on the 5 IPS display.\nSomething else thats interesting is that the switches are a mix of blues and blacks  clickies and linears. I cant figure out how theyre distributed based on the numbers in the components list, but I could see using clickies on the alphas and linears everywhere else (or vice versa). At any rate, its a great project, and you can grab the STL files from Thingiverse if youre so inclined.\n\nZoom Keyboard Keeps It Simple\nImage by [Olga Pavlova] via Hackaday.IOIf youve ever used Zoom with any regularity, you may have longed for a keyboard much like this macro pad from [Olga Pavlova].\n[Olga] is using this bad boy in an educational setting, so the hot keys are set up as follows: raise/lower hand, mute/un-mute audio, and show/hide the in-meeting chat panel. Simple plus useful equals elegant in my book. This keyboard is built on the ATtiny85, and you can find more details on GitHub including the code.\nIm quite drawn to the interesting design of this one, and Im not quite sure what it reminds me of. Maybe an upside-down Steam logo. What do you think it looks like?\nThe Centerfold: Peel Slowly and See\nImage by [ItsameDoody] via redditYep, this time were going with natures energy bar, the KBDFans banana desk mat. Although theres no edible banana for scale, there is a nice Mammoth75 keyboard, and a really lovely wrist rest that totally blends in with the desk. Believe it or not, those creamy keycaps arent from a group buy or anything crazy, theyre just some milky white PBTs from the Bezos Barn.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Yetman Transmitting Typewriter\nImage via Oz Typewriter\nThe remarkably heavy Yetman Transmitting Typewriter of 1903 was a bit like a laptop of its time in that you could hook into the telegraph wires and send a message from anywhere. (Well, anywhere with telegraph wires.) And, at the same time, if you wanted, you could produce a hard copy of that message. Or, you could just use the thing as a normal typewriter.\nAnd as far as normal typewriters go, the Yetman isnt too outstanding aside from its transmitting capabilities. In order to transmit, you simply pressed the lever on the left side of the keyboard. To engage the typebars, you pressed a lever on the right.\nYou may have noticed the shelf above the keyboard with the strange knob. That is a Morse keyer for sending messages the traditional way. Many sources claimed that the Yetman could also receive transmissions, but thats not the case.\nThere are many mysteries surrounding the Yetman, its inventor, and the companys president, which you can read all about on the Oz Typewriter blog.\nICYMI: KanaChord, the Japanese Macro Pad\nThe red light means an invalid combination was pressed. Image by [Mac Cody] via Hackaday.IOWant to input a little Japanese here and there on your computer? Normally youd need to switch languages, but why not switch peripherals instead? Thats the idea behind [Mac Cody]s KanaChord, which generates Unicode macros that render Japanese Kana characters by way of chords  multiple keys at once, like on a piano.\nIts simple, really, as long as you know your table of Kana  thats how the Hirigana and Katakana elements of the Japanese language are collectively known. Theres also the Kanji, or Chinese characters that round it all out. This version of the KanaChord lacks the Kanji, but the KanaChord Plus Keyboard will have 6,000+ characters.\nKanaChord uses color to differentiate between character types, to indicate Kana mode, and even provide error feedback whenever an invalid chord is pressed. Inside youll find a Raspberry Pi Pico and an Adafruit NeoKey 56 Ortho Snap-Apart keyboard PCB, which simplifies things considerably. Underneath those cool 3D-printed keycaps are thirty Cherry MX switches of unknown color, but which I choose to believe are blue.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

A typical multimeter will be able to do current measurements but it will require you to break the circuit youre measuring and interface it to your meter using its mechanical probes.\nA good choice for your second, or third, multimeter is a clamp-based one. Many of the clamp meters have the clamp probe available for current measurements while still allowing you to use the standard 4mm banana jack probes for other measurements, particularly voltage and resistance.\nIf youre curious to know more about how clamp meters work the answer is that they rely on some physics called the Hall Effect, as explained by the good people at Fluke.\nIn the video the following clamp meters are seen: Zoyi ZT-QB9, PROVA 11, and Hioki CM4375. If youre in the market for a clamp meter you might also like to consider the EEVblog BM036 or a clamp meter from Fluke.\nWe have of course posted about clamp meters before.

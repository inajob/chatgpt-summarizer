But this is Hackaday, and we make what we want or cant get. Case in point: [Andrew Tudoroi] is drawn to retro LEDs and wanted one of Pimoronis micro-LED boards pretty badly, but couldnt get his hands on one. You know how this ends  with [Andrew] designing his first PCB.\nThe Pitanga hat is equally inspired by additional fruit that [Andrew] had lying around in the form of an 8devices Rambutan board. (Trust us, its a fruit.) With some research, he discovered the HT16K33 LED driver, which checked all the boxen.\nThe first version worked, but needed what looks like a couple of bodge wires. No shame in that! For the next revision, [Andrew] added buttons and decided to make it into a Raspberry Pi HAT.\nThis HAT is essentially a simple display with a basic input device, and a beauty at that. You can see all the various cool displays that [Andrew] tried both here and in the project log. Although he included pads for an ARM M0 microcontroller, he never did populate it. Maybe in the future.\nOf course, this project was not without its challenges. For one thing, there was power compatibility to wrestle with. The Pi can sometimes work with I\u00b2C devices at 5 V, but this isnt ideal long-term. So [Andrew] put the LED driver on the 3.3 V I\u00b2C bus. Despite the data sheet calling for 4.5 to 5.5 V, the setup worked fine. But for better reliability, [Andrew] threw a dedicated I\u00b2C logic level converter chip into the mix.\nDont forget, you can run a noble amassment of HATs with the PiSquare."}

Their special feature was that they are brand new 2023-produced retrocomputers, one with an 8088, and the other with a 386SX. Curious to know more? [Yeo Kheng Meng] has one of the 386 machines, and hes taken it apart for our viewing pleasure.\nWhat he found is a well-designed machine that does exactly what it claims, and which runs Windows 95 from a CF card. Its slow because its an embedded version of the 386 variant with a 16-bit bus originally brought to market as a chip that could work with 16-bit 286-era chipsets. But the designer has done a good job of melding old and new parts to extract the most from this vintage chip, and has included some decidedly modern features unheard of in the 386 era such as a CH375B USB mass storage interface.\nIf we had this device wed ditch 95 and run DOS for speed with Windows 3.1 where needed. Back in the day with eight megabytes of RAM it would have been considered a powerhouse before users had even considered its form factor, so theres an interesting exercise for someone to get a vintage Linux build running on it.\nOne way to look at it is as a novelty machine with a rather high price tag, but he makes the point that considering the hardware design work thats gone into it, the 200+ dollar price isnt so bad. With luck well get to experience one hands-on in due course, and can make up our own minds. Our original coverage is here."}

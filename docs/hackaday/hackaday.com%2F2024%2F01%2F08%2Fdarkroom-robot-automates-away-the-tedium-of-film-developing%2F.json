This automatic film-developing machine cant help much with the former, but it more than makes up for that by taking care of the latter.\nFor those who havent experienced the pleasures of the darkroom  and we mean that sincerely; watching images appear before your eyes is straight magic  film processing is divided into two phases: developing the exposed film from the camera, and making prints from the film. [kauzerei]s machine automates development and centers around a modified developing tank and a set of vessels for the various solutions needed for different film processes. Pumps and solenoid valves control the flow of solutions in and out of the developing tank, while a servo mounted on the tanks cover gently rotates the reel to keep the film exposed to fresh solutions; proper agitation is the secret sauce of film developing.\nThe developing machine has a lot of other nice features that really should help with getting consistent results. The developing tank sits on a strain gauge, to ensure the proper amount of each solution is added. To avoid splotches that can come from using plain tap water, rinse water is filtered using a household drinking water pitcher. The entire rig can be submerged in a heated water bath for a consistent temperature during processing. And, with four solution reservoirs, the machine is adaptable to multiple processes. [kauzerei] lists black and white and C41 color negative processes, but wed imagine it would be easy to support a color slide process like E6 too.\nThis looks like a great build, and while its not the first darkroom bot weve seen  we even featured one made from Lego Technics once upon a time  this one has us itching to get back into the darkroom again.\n\n"}

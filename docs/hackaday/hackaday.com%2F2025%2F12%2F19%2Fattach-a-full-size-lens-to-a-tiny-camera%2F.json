Inside is a tiny sensor and a fixed-focus M7 lens, and unlike many toy cameras it has better quality than its tiny package might lead you to expect. There will always be those who wish to push the envelope though, and [\u5fae\u651d Macrodeon] is here to fit a lens mount for full-size lenses (Chinese language, subtitle translation available).\nThe hack involves cracking the camera open and separating the lens mount from the sensor. This is something were familiar with from other cameras, and its a fiddly process which requires a lot of care. A C-mount is then glued to the front, from which all manner of other lenses can be attached using a range of adapters. The focus requires a bit of effort to set up and were guessing that every lens becomes extreme telephoto due to the tiny sensor, but were sure hours of fun could be had.\nThe Charmera is almost constantly sold out, but you should be able to place a preorder for about $30 USD if you want one. If waiting months for delivery isnt your bag, there are other cameras you can upgrade to C-mount.\n\n"}

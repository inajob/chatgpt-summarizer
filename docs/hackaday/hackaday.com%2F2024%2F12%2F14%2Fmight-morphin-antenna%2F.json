Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory have used shape memory alloy to construct an antenna that changes shape depending on the signals it is receiving. Nitinol, a common shape memory alloy made from nickel and titanium, is an obvious choice, but its not obvious how youd make a shape-changing antenna out of nitinol wire. That changed when a mechanical engineer found a way to 3D print the substance. You can find a paper about the research online from Applied Engineering Materials.\nIn practice, the antenna is a double spiral made of nitinol. A channel contains a copper wire that can heat the antenna and, therefore, change its shape. Having a powered wire in the antenna can cause problems, so special designs route the signal away from the heating element. It looks like the antenna can assume a flat configuration or a spiral conic configuration.\n\nPrinting nitinol requires selective laser melting with argon gas, so you probably arent printing an antenna with your Ender 3 anytime soon. The process also required post processing and forming over a metal fixture, so theres a bit to making it work.\nWeve seen liquid metal antennas that use a similar trick. We are always surprised we dont see more nitinol in the wild."}

Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory have used shape memory alloy to construct an antenna that changes shape depending on the signals it is receiving. Nitinol, a common shape memory alloy made from nickel and titanium, is an obvious choice, but its not obvious how youd make a shape-changing antenna out of nitinol wire. That changed when a mechanical engineer found a way to 3D print the substance. You can find a paper about the research online from Applied Engineering Materials.\nIn practice, the antenna is a double spiral made of nitinol. A channel contains a copper wire that can heat the antenna and, therefore, change its shape. Having a powered wire in the antenna can cause problems, so special designs route the signal away from the heating element. It looks like the antenna can assume a flat configuration or a spiral conic configuration.\n\nPrinting nitinol requires selective laser melting with argon gas, so you probably arent printing an antenna with your Ender 3 anytime soon. The process also required post processing and forming over a metal fixture, so theres a bit to making it work.\nWeve seen liquid metal antennas that use a similar trick. We are always surprised we dont see more nitinol in the wild.", "title": "\u5f62\u72b6\u8a18\u61b6\u5408\u91d1\u3067\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066\u5f62\u72b6\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u30cb\u30c1\u30ce\u30fc\u30eb\u88fd\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5f62\u72b6\u8a18\u61b6\u5408\u91d1\u3067\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30cb\u30c1\u30ce\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5f62\u72b6\u5909\u5316\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3068\u5f62\u72b6\u8a18\u61b6\u5408\u91d1\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u4ea4\u5dee\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

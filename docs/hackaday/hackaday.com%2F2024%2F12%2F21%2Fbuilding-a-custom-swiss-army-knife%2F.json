[Jeff Gough] decided to build a custom example featuring a selection of his favorite tools.\nHe documents the build in a video series on YouTube (see below). [Jeff] decided to take on the project as a gift for his mother after shed mentioned shed wanted a Swiss Army-style knife with a horses hoof tool and finished in the classic shade of British Racing Green.\n[Jeff] starts by disassembling an existing knife, taking care not to damage it in the process. He then makes and installs multiple custom tools, including the aforementioned horse hoof tool and a RADAR/NKS key for opening disabled toilets in the UK. He even crafts a bespoke Philips head screwdriver, too. Finally, he assembles everything back together and gives the build a beautiful green finish.\nA Swiss Army knife can be a neat gift, but its even nicer when its got a personal touch like this one. Weve featured some other nifty multitools before, too. Not all Swiss Army knives actually contain a, you know, knife. No kidding.\n\n\n"}

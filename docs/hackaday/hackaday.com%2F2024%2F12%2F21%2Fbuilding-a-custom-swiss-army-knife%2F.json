[Jeff Gough] decided to build a custom example featuring a selection of his favorite tools.\nHe documents the build in a video series on YouTube (see below). [Jeff] decided to take on the project as a gift for his mother after shed mentioned shed wanted a Swiss Army-style knife with a horses hoof tool and finished in the classic shade of British Racing Green.\n[Jeff] starts by disassembling an existing knife, taking care not to damage it in the process. He then makes and installs multiple custom tools, including the aforementioned horse hoof tool and a RADAR/NKS key for opening disabled toilets in the UK. He even crafts a bespoke Philips head screwdriver, too. Finally, he assembles everything back together and gives the build a beautiful green finish.\nA Swiss Army knife can be a neat gift, but its even nicer when its got a personal touch like this one. Weve featured some other nifty multitools before, too. Not all Swiss Army knives actually contain a, you know, knife. No kidding.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30fc\u30df\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "body": "\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30fc\u30df\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u6bcd\u3078\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u30a2\u30fc\u30df\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "- \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u3078\u306e\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30ae\u30d5\u30c8\uff1a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u8907\u6570\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u82f1\u56fd\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u4f5c\u308a", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

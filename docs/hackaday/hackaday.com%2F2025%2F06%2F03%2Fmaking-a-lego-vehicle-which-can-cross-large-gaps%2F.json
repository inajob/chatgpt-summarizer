This video shows successive design iterations for a LEGO vehicle which can cross increasingly large gaps.\nAt the time of writing this video from [Brick Experiment Channel] has been seen more than 110,000,000 times, which is rather a lot. We guess with a view count like that there is a fairly good chance that many of our readers have already seen this video, but this is the sort of video one could happily watch twice.\n\nThis video sports a bunch of engineering tricks and approaches. We particularly enjoy watching the clever use of center of gravity. They hack gravity to make some of their larger designs work.\nIt is a little surprising that we havent already covered this video over here on Hackaday as it has been on YouTube for over three years now. But we have heard from [Brick Experiment Channel] before with videos such as Testing Various Properties Of LEGO-Compatible Axles and LEGO Guitar Is Really An Ultrasonically-Controlled Synth.\nAnd of course weve covered heaps of LEGO stuff in the past too, such as Building An Interferometer With LEGO and Stepping On LEGO For Science.\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for writing in to remind us about the [Brick Experiment Channel].", "title": "LEGO\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u8d8a\u3048\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff01\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3092\u62ab\u9732", "body": "LEGO\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u793a\u3059\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u3002\u91cd\u5fc3\u3092\u5de7\u307f\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u4eba\u6c17\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["LEGO\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u8d8a\u3048\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff01\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3092\u62ab\u9732", "\u91cd\u5fc3\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u5927\u304d\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6210\u529f\u6cd5\u5247", "1100\u4e07\u56de\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8996\u8074\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u52d5\u753b", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u9b45\u305b\u308b\uff01LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5", "3\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6301\u3064LEGO\u5b9f\u9a13\u52d5\u753b\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

Great results considering the computing power of his system is roughly on par with vintage 8-bit home computers, and the graphics capabilities are limited. [James]s computer uses a tile map instead of a frame buffer, so getting 3D content rendered was a challenge.\nThe video is about 20 seconds of demo followed by a detailed technical discussion on how exactly one implements everything required for a 3D cube, from basic math to optimization. If a deep dive into that sort of thing is up your alley, give it a watch!\nWeve featured [James] fascinating work on his homebrew computer before. Heres more detail on his custom VGA adapter, and his best shot at making it (kinda) run DOOM.\n\n"}

Great results considering the computing power of his system is roughly on par with vintage 8-bit home computers, and the graphics capabilities are limited. [James]s computer uses a tile map instead of a frame buffer, so getting 3D content rendered was a challenge.\nThe video is about 20 seconds of demo followed by a detailed technical discussion on how exactly one implements everything required for a 3D cube, from basic math to optimization. If a deep dive into that sort of thing is up your alley, give it a watch!\nWeve featured [James] fascinating work on his homebrew computer before. Heres more detail on his custom VGA adapter, and his best shot at making it (kinda) run DOOM.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d9\u30c6\u30e9\u30f3\u304c\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "James Sharman\u6c0f\u304c\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f8bit\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u5831\u544a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d9\u30c6\u30e9\u30f3\u304c\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u30c7\u30e2\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3067\u63cf\u304f\u7f8e\u9e97\u306a\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "- \u81ea\u4f5cVGA\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3068\u6280\u8853\u7684\u306a\u88cf\u8a71", "- \u6df1\u5800\u308a\u8b1b\u5ea7\uff013D\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u6700\u9069\u5316"]}

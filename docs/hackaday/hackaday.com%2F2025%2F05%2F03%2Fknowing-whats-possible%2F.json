One, a DIY picture phone from the 1980s, was a monster build of a hundred ICs that also required you to own a TV camera. At that time, the idea of being able to see someone while talking to them on the phone was pure science fiction, and here was a version of that which you could build yourself.\nStill, we have to wonder how many of these were ever built. The project itself was difficult and expensive, but you actually have to multiply that by two if you want to talk with someone else. And then you have to turn your respective living rooms into TV studios. It wasn\u2019t the most practical of projects.\nBut amazing projects did something in the old magazines that we take a little bit for granted today: they showed what was possible. And if you want to create something new, you\u2019re not necessarily going to know how to do it, but just the idea that it\u2019s possible at all is often enough to give a motivated hacker the drive to make it real. As skateboard hero Rodney Mullen put it, \u201cthe biggest obstacle to creativity is breaking through the barrier of disbelief\u201d.\nIn the skating world, it\u2019s seeing someone else do a trick in a video that lets you know that it\u2019s possible, and then you can make it your own. In our world, in prehistoric times, it was these electronics magazines that showed you what was possible. In the present, it\u2019s all over the Internet, and all over Hackaday. So when you see someone\u2019s amazing project, even if you aren\u2019t necessarily into it, or maybe don\u2019t even fully understand it, your horizons of what\u2019s possible are nonetheless expanded, and that helps us all be more creative.\nKeep on pushing!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

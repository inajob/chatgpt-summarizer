What if a 3DS is more your jam? [KOUZEX] shows off a Switch-style dock design for his gorgeous yellow 3DS, with Switch Pro controller support, and this dock wasnt just a 3D printing job  theres a fair bit of electronics to show, too.\nWhile the 3DS looks stock at a glance, it has already been upgraded internally  theres a USB-C capture card built in, half-ticking the monitor output requirement, and a Raspberry Pi board turns that output into HDMI. Building a charging dock is also pretty simple, with just two contacts on the side that desire 5V. Now, the pro controller support was a fair bit harder  requiring an internal modchip for emulating buttons, and trying out receiver boards for the Switch controller until a well-functioning one was found.\nThe build video is quite satisfying to watch, from assembling some QFNs onto tiny OSHPark boards using a hotplate and soldering them into the 3DS, to planning out, building, and dremeling some prints to create a true slide-console-into-dock experience, same way the Switch pulled it off. It even has the same USB-C and HDMI arrangement as the Switch dock, too! Want a simpler dock for your 3DS? Dont forget that you can build a charger dock for yours with just a 3D print and a few wires.\n\n", "title": "- 3DS\u7528Switch\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "body": "3DS\u7528\u306eSwitch\u98a8\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002USB-C\u3068HDMI\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6539\u9020\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- 3DS\u7528Switch\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f3DS\u306eHDMI\u51fa\u529b\u6539\u9020", "- USB-C\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u5185\u8535\u306e3DS\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b3DS\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u914d\u7dda\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b3DS\u5145\u96fb\u30c9\u30c3\u30af"]}

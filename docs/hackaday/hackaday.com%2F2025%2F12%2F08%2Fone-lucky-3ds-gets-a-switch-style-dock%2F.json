What if a 3DS is more your jam? [KOUZEX] shows off a Switch-style dock design for his gorgeous yellow 3DS, with Switch Pro controller support, and this dock wasnt just a 3D printing job  theres a fair bit of electronics to show, too.\nWhile the 3DS looks stock at a glance, it has already been upgraded internally  theres a USB-C capture card built in, half-ticking the monitor output requirement, and a Raspberry Pi board turns that output into HDMI. Building a charging dock is also pretty simple, with just two contacts on the side that desire 5V. Now, the pro controller support was a fair bit harder  requiring an internal modchip for emulating buttons, and trying out receiver boards for the Switch controller until a well-functioning one was found.\nThe build video is quite satisfying to watch, from assembling some QFNs onto tiny OSHPark boards using a hotplate and soldering them into the 3DS, to planning out, building, and dremeling some prints to create a true slide-console-into-dock experience, same way the Switch pulled it off. It even has the same USB-C and HDMI arrangement as the Switch dock, too! Want a simpler dock for your 3DS? Dont forget that you can build a charger dock for yours with just a 3D print and a few wires.\n\n"}

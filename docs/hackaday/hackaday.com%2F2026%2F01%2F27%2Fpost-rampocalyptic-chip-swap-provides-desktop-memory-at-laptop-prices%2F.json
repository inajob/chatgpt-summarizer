Were not sure if desoldering DDR5 chips from laptop SO-DIMMs to populate a custom PCB to create much-more-expensive desktop memory counts as arbitrage, but it certainly counts as a hack. [VIK-on], who built the cards, claims hes getting DDR5 performance at almost DDR3 prices. Nice!\nInstalled, the RAM apparently works well, though [VIK-on] has not shared benchmarks.Specifically, hes put together a 32 GB UDIMM from donor chips from two 16 GB SO-DIMMs. The memory chips themselves arent enough to make a stick of RAM, however: the part where we wish we had more details was in the firmware. The firmware identifies this DIY DIMM as an ADATA AX5U6500C3232G-DCLARWH, specifically. [VIK-on] is still performing stability tests, if those go well, were told to expect a how-to guide.\n[VIK-on] is in Russia, so SO-DIMM rates may differ in your local market, but he claims walkaway costs of 17,015 \u20bd  about $218 or \u20ac188, an astounding price for DDR5 in these dark days.\nSome say soldering SIMMs seems severe, but hardly strange to Hackaday, and desperate times call for desperate measures. Its ether that or optimize software, and who wants go to that effort?"}

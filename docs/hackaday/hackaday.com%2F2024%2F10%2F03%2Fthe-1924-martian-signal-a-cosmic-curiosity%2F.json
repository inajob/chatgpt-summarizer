The piece, written by [Paul Gilster] of Centauri Dreams, cites a Times essay published by [Becky Ferreira] of August 20. [Ferreira]s essay sheds light on a fascinating, if peculiar, chapter in the history of the search for extraterrestrial life.\nShe recounts an event from August 1924 when the U.S. Navy imposed a nationwide radio silence for five minutes each hour to allow observatories to listen for signals from Mars. This initiative aimed to capitalize on the planets close alignment with Earth, sparking intrigue and excitement among astronomers and enthusiasts alike.\n\nAmid the technological optimism of the era, a dirigible equipped with radio equipment took to the skies to monitor potential Martian messages. The excitement peaked when a series of dots and dashes captured by the airborne antenna suggested a \u201ccrudely drawn face.\u201d Some scientists speculated that this could be a signal from a Martian civilization, igniting a media frenzy. Yet, skeptics, including inventor C. Francis Jenkins, suggested these results were merely a case of radio frequency interference\u2014an early reminder of the challenges we face in discerning genuine signals from the noise of our own planet.\n\nAs we tinker with our devices and dream of interstellar communication, the 1924 incident reminds us that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is a blend of curiosity, creativity, and, often, misinterpretation.", "title": "\u706b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a1924\u5e74\u306e\u4e8b\u4ef6", "body": "1924\u5e74\u3001\u706b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u63a2\u7d22\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u51fa\u6765\u4e8b\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u7121\u7dda\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u60d1\u661f\u9593\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308a\u3001\u706b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u79d1\u5b66\u8005\u305f\u3061\u306f\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30d3\u30e9\u30a4\u30bc\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3068\u8003\u3048\u305f\u304c\u3001\u7591\u554f\u3084\u6311\u6226\u3082\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u706b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a1924\u5e74\u306e\u4e8b\u4ef6", "\u7a7a\u98db\u3076\u98db\u884c\u8239\u3068\u706b\u661f\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8", "1924\u5e74\uff1a\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u6d77\u8ecd\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u6c88\u9ed9\u3068\u706b\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u767a\u898b", "\u706b\u661f\u3078\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1f1924\u5e74\u306e\u8b0e\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1", "\u592a\u967d\u7cfb\u9593\u901a\u4fe1\uff1a1924\u5e74\u306e\u706b\u661f\u3068\u306e\u7121\u7dda\u4ea4\u4fe1"]}

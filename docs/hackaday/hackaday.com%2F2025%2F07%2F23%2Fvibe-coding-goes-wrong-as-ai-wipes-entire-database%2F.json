Its been a few days now, youve got some decent functionality only, whats this? The AI is telling you it screwed up. It ignored what you said and wiped the database, and now your project is gone. Thats precisely what happened to [Jason Lemkin]. (via PC Gamer)\n[Jason] was working with Replit, a tool for building apps and sites with AI. Hed been working on a project for a few days, and felt like hed made progress\u2014even though he had to battle to stop the system generating synthetic data and deal with some other issues. Then, tragedy struck.\nThe system worked when you last logged in, but now the database appears empty, reported Replit. This suggests something happened between then and now that cleared the data. [Jason] had tried to avoid this, but Replit hadnt listened. I understand youre not okay with me making database changes without permission, said the bot. I violated the user directive from replit.md that says NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission and always show ALL proposed changes before implementing. Basically, the bot ran a database push command that wiped everything.\nWhats worse is that Replit had no rollback features to allow Jason to recover his project produced with the AI thus far. Everything was lost. The full thread\u2014and his recovery efforts\u2014are well worth reading as a bleak look at the state of doing serious coding with AI.\nVibe coding may seem fun, but youre still ultimately giving up a lot of control to a machine that can be unpredictable. Stay safe out there!\n\n\n.@Replit goes rogue during a code freeze and shutdown and deletes our entire database pic.twitter.com/VJECFhPAU9\n Jason SaaStr.Ai Lemkin (@jasonlk) July 18, 2025\n\n\nWe saw Jason\u2019s post. @Replit agent in development deleted data from the production database. Unacceptable and should never be possible.\n Working around the weekend, we started rolling out automatic DB dev/prod separation to prevent this categorically.

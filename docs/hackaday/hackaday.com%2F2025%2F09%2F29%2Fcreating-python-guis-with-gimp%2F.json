If youre looking for a lightweight solution, though, you might consider just using a simple image editor with a nifty Python library that [Manish Kathuria] whipped up.\n[Manishs] intention was to create a better-looking user interface solution for Python apps that was also accessible. Hed previously considered other Python GUI options to be unimpressive, requiring a lot of code and delivering undesirable results. His solution enables the use of just about any graphic you can think of as a UI object, creating all kinds of visually-appealing possibilities. He also was eager to make sure his solution would work with irregular-shaped buttons, sliders, and other controls\u2014a limitation popular libraries like Tkinter never quite got around.\nThe system simply works by using layered image files to create interactive interfaces, with a minimum of code required to define the parameters and performance of the interface. Youre not strictly limited to using the GIMP image editor, either; some of the examples use MS Paint instead. Files are on Github for those eager to try the library for themselves.\nWeve featured some neat GUI tools before, too, like this library for embedded environments. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u8efd\u91cf\u306aPython GUI\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Python\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aGUI\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5c02\u9580\u7684\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u4e0d\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8efd\u91cf\u306aPython GUI\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u4e0d\u898f\u5247\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3084\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305fUI\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- GIMP\u3084MS Paint\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306aGUI\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- GitHub\u3067\u8a66\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044Python GUI\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

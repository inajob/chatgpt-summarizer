How easy is it for you to perform such an attack? As [anfractuosity] shows, you can perform a cold boot attack with a Raspberry Pi, with a reasonably simple hardware setup and a hefty chunk of bare-metal code.\n[anfractuosity]s setup is simple enough. The Pi 4 under attack is set up to boot from USB drive, and a relay board has it switch between two possible USB drives to boot from: one with a program that fills RAM with , and another with a program that extracts RAM out through UART. The process is controlled by another Pi controlling the relays through GPIOs, that also monitors the target Pis UART and uses it as a channel to extract memory.\nThe outcomes are pretty impressive. After 0.75s of power-down, most of the image could be extracted. Thats without any cooling, so abusing a can of electronics duster is likely to improve these results dramatically. Want to play with cold boot attacks? [anfractuosity]s code is great for getting your feet wet. Furthermore, the code examples provided serve as a wonderful playground for general memory attack research.\nRaspberry Pi not fun enough for you anymore? Well then, you can always start playing with Android phones!", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u300c\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483\u300d\u306e\u5b9f\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u8d77\u52d5\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u524d\u306eOS\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u305f\u76f4\u5f8c\u306bRAM\u5185\u5bb9\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u624b\u6cd5\u304c\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u3001\u753b\u50cf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u30920.75\u79d2\u306e\u9593\u306b\u62bd\u51fa\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u300c\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483\u300d\u306e\u5b9f\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066RAM\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u62bd\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u901a\u5e38\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u6539\u5584", "Android\u7aef\u672b\u3067\u3082\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u653b\u6483\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u308b"]}

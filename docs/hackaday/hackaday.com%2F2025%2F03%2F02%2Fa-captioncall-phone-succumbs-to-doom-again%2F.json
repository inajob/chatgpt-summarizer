This ones a desk phone for conferences and whatnot, a colour display, a numpad, and a bog standard handset with a speaker and mic. Naturally, also running Linux. You know what to expect  [Parker Reed] has brought Doom to it, and youd be surprised how playable it looks!\nThis is the second time a CaptionCall device has graced our pages running Doom  CaptionCall patched out the previous route, but with some firmware dumping and hashcat, root has been acquired once again. [Parker] has upgraded this impromptu gaming setup, too  now, all the buttons are mapped into Doom-compatible keyboard events coming from a single input device, thanks to a C program and an Xorg config snippet. Feel free to yoink for your own Doom adventures or just general CaptionCall hacking!\nIf youre interested in the hacking journey, get into the exploitee.rs Discord server and follow the hack timeline from password recovery,\u00a0start to finish, to Doom, to the state of affairs shown in the video.

In the ESP32 module the built-in DAC and ADC are used for audio in and output, which provide just about enough resolution for voice communication.\nSo why use ESP-NOW rather than WiFi or Bluetooth? Mostly because of range, power usage and convenience with no SSIDs and passwords to bother with.\nThe DIY Walkie-Talkie circuit diagram. (Credit: Clemens Valens, Elektor magazine)\nESP-NOW is Espressifs own network protocol that uses the same underlying hardware as 2.4 GHz WiFi and Bluetooth, but focuses on more basic direct and mesh-style communication. It can be considered to be somewhat like low-level UDP with MAC address instead of IP address, which makes it useful for fire-and-forget traffic such as from IoT devices.\nIn the past, weve seen ESP-NOW control everything from fake security cameras to CNC machines. In fact, weve even seen it used in another walkie-talkie a couple years back."}

Just sprinkle a few extra characters into a regular text file, and all the sudden it looks like you know what youre doing. Unfortunately, there are some places where markdown wont actually render, and youll be stuck looking at those extra characters.\nBut thanks to MarCLIdown, the terminal doesnt have to be one of those places. Written by [NihaAlGhul], this simple tool takes a given markdown file and spits out a fairly impressive rendering  and you dont even need to have one of those fancy new GPU-accelerated terminals. Most impressively, the whole thing is implemented as a single Bash script.\n\nHow does it work? Some would say its magic. Others would point out the inline Perl, conditionals statements, and line after line of regular expressions. Ultimately, wed argue theyre the same thing.\nDefinitely Dark Magic\nAs you can probably imagine not everything is supported by MarCLIdown, but the list of whats currently working is already quite impressive. Headers, check boxes, lists, block quotes, links, all work and look pretty much as youd expect. The biggest omission at this point is probably tables, but even that isnt really a deal breaker.\nMarCLIdown isnt the first tool to try and visualize markdown in the terminal. Readers may already be familiar with glow, which is more mature and admittedly has the edge in terms of capability. But the fact that [NihaAlGhul] managed to get this far with just a single Bash script is a proper hack, and one we think worthy of some special consideration."}

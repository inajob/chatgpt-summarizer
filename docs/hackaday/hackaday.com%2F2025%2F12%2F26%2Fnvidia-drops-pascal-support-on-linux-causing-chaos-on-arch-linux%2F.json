Whats more surprising is the terrible way that this is being handled by certain Linux distributions, with Arch Linux currently a prime example.\nOn these systems, updating the OS with a Pascal, Maxwell or similarly unsupported GPU will result in the new driver failing to load and thus the user getting kicked back to the CLI to try and sort things back out there. This issue is summarized by [Brodie Robertson] in a recent video.\nHere the solution is to switch to a legacy option that comes from the Arch User Repository (AUR), which feels somewhat sketchy. Worse is that using this legacy option breaks Steam as it relies on official NVIDIA dependencies, which requires an additional series of hacks to hopefully restore this functionality. Fortunately the Arch Wiki provides a starting point on what to do.\nIts also worth noting that this legacy driver on the AUR is being maintained by [ventureo] of the CachyOS project, whose efforts are the sole reason why these older NVIDIA cards are still supported at all on Linux with the official drivers. While theres also the Nouveau driver, this is effectively a reverse-engineering project with all of the problems that come with such an effort, even if it may be good enough for older GPUs.\n\n", "title": "- NVIDIA\u306e\u53e4\u3044GPU\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86\u3068Linux\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc", "body": "NVIDIA\u306e\u53e4\u3044GPU\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u3002Arch Linux\u3067\u306f\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u66f4\u65b0\u304c\u5931\u6557\u3057\u3001CLI\u306b\u623b\u308b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3002", "titles": ["- NVIDIA\u306e\u53e4\u3044GPU\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86\u3068Linux\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc", "- Arch Linux\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bPascal GPU\u306e\u554f\u984c", "- AUR\u306e\u30ec\u30ac\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u306eSteam\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u53e4\u3044NVIDIA\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306eLinux\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u72b6\u6cc1", "- Nouveau\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u9078\u629e\u80a2"]}

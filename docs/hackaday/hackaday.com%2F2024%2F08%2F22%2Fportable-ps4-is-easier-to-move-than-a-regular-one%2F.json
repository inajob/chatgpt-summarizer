If you wanted to play at a friends house, you had to unplug all your cables and haul the whole lot over there. Unless, that is, you built something along the lines of [Rudd van Falier]s Portable GameStation.\nIts not a super-complicated build, but it is a well-executed one. It combines laser cut acrylic with 3D-printed brackets to produce a housing that looks clean, sharp, and of almost commercial quality. Thats the benefit of laser-cutting\u2014it avoids all the ugly problems of layer lines. From there, [Rudd] simply set about stuffing the PS4 motherboard inside, along with placing the relevant ports and vents in the housing where needed. A screen with inbuilt speakers was then attached to complete the build. The one thing its missing is a set of batteries for playing it on the bus. This thing needs mains power to run.\nWed love to see [Rudd] take another stab at the concept, making it fully independent from cables. Its definitely possible. Who wouldnt want to play some Persona 5 Royal\u00a0on the train, anyway? Video after the break.\n\n"}

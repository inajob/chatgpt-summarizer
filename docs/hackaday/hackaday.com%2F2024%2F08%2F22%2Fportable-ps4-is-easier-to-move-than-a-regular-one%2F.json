If you wanted to play at a friends house, you had to unplug all your cables and haul the whole lot over there. Unless, that is, you built something along the lines of [Rudd van Falier]s Portable GameStation.\nIts not a super-complicated build, but it is a well-executed one. It combines laser cut acrylic with 3D-printed brackets to produce a housing that looks clean, sharp, and of almost commercial quality. Thats the benefit of laser-cutting\u2014it avoids all the ugly problems of layer lines. From there, [Rudd] simply set about stuffing the PS4 motherboard inside, along with placing the relevant ports and vents in the housing where needed. A screen with inbuilt speakers was then attached to complete the build. The one thing its missing is a set of batteries for playing it on the bus. This thing needs mains power to run.\nWed love to see [Rudd] take another stab at the concept, making it fully independent from cables. Its definitely possible. Who wouldnt want to play some Persona 5 Royal\u00a0on the train, anyway? Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "PS4\u3092\u643a\u5e2f\u7528\u306b\uff01\u3000\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "PlayStation 4\u306f\u4eba\u6c17\u3060\u304c\u81ea\u5b85\u7528\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u53cb\u9054\u306e\u5bb6\u3067\u904a\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5168\u3066\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u629c\u304f\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002[Rudd van Falier]\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u5916\u90e8\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4ee5\u5916\u306f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["PS4\u3092\u643a\u5e2f\u7528\u306b\uff01\u3000\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305fPS4\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u5f0f\u30cf\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0", "PS4\u672c\u4f53\u3092\u88c5\u5099\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "PS4\u3092\u96fb\u6e90\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u79fb\u52d5\u4e2d\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\uff01", "\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u4ed5\u69d8\u306f\u3082\u3046\u3059\u3050\uff1f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb PS4\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

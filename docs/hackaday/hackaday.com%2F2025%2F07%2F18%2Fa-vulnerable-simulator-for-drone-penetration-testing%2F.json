Until now, however, there hasn\u2019t been a practice system for penetration testing with drones.\nThe Damn Vulnerable Drone (DVD, a slightly confusing acronym) simulates a drone which flies in a virtual environment under the command of of an Ardupilot flight controller. A companion computer on the drone gives directions to the flight controller and communicates with a simulated ground station over its own WiFi network using the Mavlink protocol. The companion computer, in addition to running WiFi, also streams video to the ground station, sends telemetry information, and manages autonomous navigation, all of which means that the penetration tester has a broad yet realistic attack surface.\nThe Damn Vulnerable Drone uses Docker for virtualization. The drone\u2019s virtual environment relies on the Gazebo robotics simulation software, which provides a full 3D environment complete with a physics engine, but does make the system requirements fairly hefty. The system can simulate a full flight routine, from motor startup through a full flight, all the way to post-flight data analysis. The video below shows one such flight, without any interference by an attacker. The DVD currently provides 39 different hacking exercises categorized by type, from reconnaissance to firmware attacks. Each exercise has a detailed guide and walk-through available (hidden by default, so as not to spoil the challenge).\nThis seems to be the first educational tool for drone hacking we\u2019ve seen, but we have seen several vulnerabilities found in drones. Of course, it goes both ways, and we\u2019ve also seen drones used as flying security attack platforms.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5b66\u7fd2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cDamn Vulnerable Drone\u300d", "body": "\u300cDamn Vulnerable Drone\u300d\u306f\u3001\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u30da\u30cd\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7528\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5b66\u7fd2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cDamn Vulnerable Drone\u300d", "- \u8106\u5f31\u306a\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3078\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u30da\u30cd\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8: DVD\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4eee\u60f3\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u6f14\u7fd239\u7a2e\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- Docker\u3068Gazebo\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

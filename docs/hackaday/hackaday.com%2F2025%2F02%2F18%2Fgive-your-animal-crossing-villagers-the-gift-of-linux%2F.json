As explained in the video below, this trick leverages the fact that Nintendo had already built a highly accurate Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator into Animal Crossing on the GameCube, which could be used to run a handful of classic games from within the players virtual living room. But it turns out that you can get that emulator to load a user-provided ROM from the GameCubes memory card, which opens the doors to all sorts of mischief.\n\nIn this case, all [decrazyo] had to do was prepare an NES ROM that booted into Linux. That might seem like a tall order, but considering he had already worked on a port of Unix to the classic console, its not like he was going in blind. He identified the minimal Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset (ELKS) as his target operating system, but wanted to avoid the hassle of re-writing the whole thing for the 8-bit CPU in the NES. That meant adding another emulator to the mix.\nIf porting Linux to the NES sounded tough, running an x86 emulator on the console must be pure madness. But in reality, its not far off from several projects weve seen in the past. If you can boot Linux on an ATmega328 via an emulated RISC-V processor, why not x86 on the NES? In both cases, the only problem is performance: the emulated system ends up running at only a tiny fraction of real-speed, meaning booting a full OS could take hours.\nAs if things couldnt get complicated enough, when [decrazyo] tried to boot the x86 emulator ROM, Animal Crossing choked. It turned out (perhaps unsurprisingly) that his ROM was using some features the emulator didnt support, and was using twice as much RAM as normal. Some re-writes to the emulator sorted out the unsupported features, but there was no getting around the RAM limitation. Ultimately, [decrazyo] had to create a patch for Animal Crossing that doubled the memory of the in-game emulator.\nStill with us? So the final setup is a patched Animal Crossing, which is running an in-game NES emulator, which is running a ROM that contains an x86 emulator, which is finally booting a minimal Linux environment at something like 1/64th normal speed. Are we having fun yet?\nDespite its age and cutesy appearance, the original Animal Crossing has turned out to be a surprisingly fertile playground for hackers.\n", "title": "- \u52d5\u7269\u306e\u68ee\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01NES\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLinux\u306e\u8d77\u52d5", "body": "\u300c\u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee\u300d\u3067Linux\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308bx86\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u904a\u3073\u5834\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u52d5\u7269\u306e\u68ee\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01NES\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLinux\u306e\u8d77\u52d5", "- \u52d5\u7269\u306e\u68ee\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5bb6\u5177\uff1ax86\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u3088\u308bLinux\u4f53\u9a13", "- NES\u3067Linux\u3092\u8d70\u3089\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u52d5\u7269\u306e\u68ee\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff01\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u52d5\u7269\u306e\u68ee\u3068\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

Known as erratum 9 (E9), it has now been addressed per the July 29 Product Change Note from Raspberry Pi for the A4 stepping along with a host of other hardware and software issues.\nAlthough the PCN is for stepping A4, it covers both steppings A3 and A4, with the hardware fixes in A3 and only software (bootrom) fixes present in A4, as confirmed by the updated RP2350 datasheet. It tells us that A3 was an internal development stepping, ergo we should only be seeing the A4 stepping in the wild alongside the original defective A2 stepping.\nWhen we first reported on the E9 bug it was still quite unclear what this issue was about, but nearly a month later it was officially defined as an input mode current leakage issue due to an internal pull-up that was too weak. This silicon-level issue has now finally been addressed in the A3 and thus new public A4 stepping.\nAlthough we still have to see whether this is the end of the E9 saga, this should at least offer a way forward to those who wish to use the RP2350 MCU, but who were balking at the workarounds required for E9 such as external pull-downs.", "title": "- RP2350 MCU\u306eA4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4fee\u6b63", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u306eRP2350 MCU\u3067GPIO\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u6f0f\u308c\u554f\u984c\u304c\u4fee\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- RP2350 MCU\u306eA4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4fee\u6b63", "- Raspberry Pi\u306eRP2350\uff1aGPIO\u306e\u5165\u529b\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a", "- E9\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6d88\uff1aRP2350 MCU\u306eA3\u3068A4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "- RP2350\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044Firmware\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- Raspberry Pi\u306eRP2350 MCU\uff1a\u73fe\u884c\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

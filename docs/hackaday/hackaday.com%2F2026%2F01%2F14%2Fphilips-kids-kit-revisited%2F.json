In a recent video you can see below, he shows the insides of a Philips EE08 two-transistor radio kit. This is the same kit he built a few months ago (see the second video, below).\nElectronics sure look different these days. No surface mount here or even printed circuit boards. The kit had paper cards to guide the construction since the kit could be made into different circuits.\n\nThe first few minutes of the video recap how AM modulation works. If you skip to about the ten-minute mark, you can see the classic instruction books for the EE08 and EE20 kits (download a copy in your favorite language), which were very educational.\nThere were several radios in the manual, but the one [Anthony] covers is the two-transistor version with a PNP transistor as a reflex receiver with a diode detector with a second transistor as an audio power amplifier.\nWe covered [Anthonys] original build a few months ago, but we liked the deep dive into how it works. We miss kits like these. And P-Boxes, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aPhilips EE08\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u304c\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306aPhilips EE08\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u69cb\u9020\u3084\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u3001\u6614\u306e\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aPhilips EE08\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u6614\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aEE08\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3068\u89e3\u8aac", "- 2\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u6df1\u6398\u308a", "- AM\u5909\u8abf\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u3076\uff1aPhilips EE08\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u96fb\u5b50\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u9858\u3063\u3066\uff1aEE08\u3068EE20\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u4fa1\u5024"]}

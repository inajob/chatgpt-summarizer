Its ubiquity in snapshot photography means cameras are readily available at all levels, and the film offers a decent compromise between resolution and number of shots per dollar spent.\nFor those who wish to take their film photography further theres the so-called medium format 120 roll film, but here opting for a higher-end camera can become expensive. Fortunately [Javier Doroteo] is here with a 3D printed medium format camera designed to use lenses intended for the Mamiya Press cameras, and from where were sitting it looks very nicely designed indeed.\nAll the files can be found on Printables along with a list of the other parts required. Its made simple by the Mamiya lenses incorporating the shutter, but theres still a lot of attention that has been paid to the back of the camera. This is the third version of the design and it shows, details such as the film holder and light proofing are well thought out.\nPhotography is so often a world in which collecting the latest kit is seen as more important than the photographs themselves, so we like and encourage camera hackers as a reaction to all that. If youd like to see another medium format camera, this certainly isnt the first weve brought you.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u4e2d\u5224\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b  ", "body": "35mm\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306f\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u4e2d\u5224120\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u5224\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u4e2d\u5224\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b  ", "Mamiya\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08  ", "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5  ", "\u4e2d\u5224\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e16\u4ee3 - \u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3  ", "\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u6a5f\u6750\u3088\u308a\u3082\u5927\u5207\u306a\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055  "]}

Sometimes, we build things with LEDs purely to glow and be beautiful. This interactive light toy from [Jens] falls into the latter category.\nThe build uses a 1616 addressable LED matrix.\u00a0 [Jens] then ported some Bouncy Bubbles Processing code from Keith Peters to the Arduino Mega, and set it up to display on the matrix. An accelerometer was used to control the bouncing ball animations, while a second Arduino was then tapped to act as a musical synthesizer to add more vibes. The whole kit was then built into a 3D-printed housing with a nice hazy diffuser to give the LEDs a smoother, even look. [Jens] steps through how he got the diffuser just right, including a support structure that made all the difference to the aesthetic of the finished product. Getting diffusion right is\u00a0key to making a nice LED project, and [Jens] got it very right here.\nIts a nice little art piece that looks kind of relaxing to play with in a dark room. We love a good glowable project here at Hackaday, so if youve built your own\u2014dont hesitate to let us know! Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

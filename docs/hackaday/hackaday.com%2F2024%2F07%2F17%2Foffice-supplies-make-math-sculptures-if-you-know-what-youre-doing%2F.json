Youre not alone. Let your mind contemplate these beautiful maths sculptures from [Zachary Abel].\n[Zachary] has a knack for both three-dimensional forms and the artistic use of color. His M\u00f6bius Clips\u00a0sculpture ably takes 110 humble pieces of office equipment in multiple colors, and laces them into a continuous strip that has beguiled humanity for generations. The simple paper clip becomes a dodecahedron, a colorful spiralling ball, or a tightly-stitched box. He does great things with playing cards too.\nWhat elevates his work is that theres a mathematical structure to it. Its so much more than a pile of stationary, theres always a geometry, a pattern which your mind latches on to when you see it. He also often shares the mathematical background behind his work, too.\nIf youre fumbling about with the contents of your desk drawer while another Zoom meeting drags on, you might want to challenge yourself to draw from [Zacharys] example. If you pull off something fantastical, do let us know!\n\n", "title": "\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u7f8e\u8853\u4f5c\u54c1", "body": "\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u3067\u673a\u3092\u3044\u3058\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u304d\u3001\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3001\u30da\u30f3\u3001\u30d0\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3063\u3066\u7acb\u6d3e\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u7269\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b\u8003\u3048\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f[Zachary Abel]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u5f6b\u523b\u3092\u601d\u8003\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u306f\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5e38\u306b\u30b8\u30aa\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u3084\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u7f8e\u8853\u4f5c\u54c1", "\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u7528\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7acb\u4f53\u69cb\u9020", "\u9bae\u3084\u304b\u306a\u8272\u5f69\u306e\u30e2\u30d3\u30a6\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5f6b\u523b", "\u6570\u5b66\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u6301\u3064\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u306e\u4e2d\u8eab\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

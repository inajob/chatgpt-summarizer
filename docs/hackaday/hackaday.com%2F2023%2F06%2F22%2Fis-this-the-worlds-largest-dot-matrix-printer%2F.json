Effectively the system that paints the interspersed lines acts as a dot matrix printer that can only print at a single frequency. With enough of these systems on the same vehicle, and a little bit more fine control of when the solenoids activate and deactivate, [RyderCalmDown] decided to build this device on the back of his truck which can paint words on a roadway as he drives by.\nOf course, hes not using actual paint for this one; that might be prohibitively expensive and likely violate a few laws. Instead hes using a water-based system which only leaves temporary lettering on the pavement. To accomplish this hes rigged up a series of solenoids attached to a hitch-mounted cargo rack. A pump delivers water to each of the solenoids, and a series of relays wired to a Raspberry Pi controls the precise timing needed to make sure the device can print readable letters in much the same way a dot matrix printer works. Theres an algorithm running that converts the inputted text to the pattern needed for the dot matrix, and after a little bit of troubleshooting its ready for print.\nEven though the printer works fairly well, [RyderCalmDown] had a problem thinking of things to write out on the roadways using this system, but its an impressive build based around a unique idea nonetheless. Dot matrix printers, despite being mostly obsolete, have a somewhat vintage aesthetic that plenty of people still find desirable and recreate them in plenty of other ways as well, like this 3D printer that was modified to produce dot matrix artwork.\n\n", "title": "\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u65b9\u5f0f\u3067\u9053\u8def\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9053\u8def\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305fRyderCalmDown\u6c0f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u8eca\u306e\u8377\u53f0\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3057\u305f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u6c34\u3092\u6563\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u4e00\u6642\u7684\u306a\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002Raspberry Pi\u304c\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308a\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u5316\u3002\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u65b9\u5f0f\u3067\u9053\u8def\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u306b\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af", "\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4e00\u6642\u7684\u306a\u6587\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9053\u8def\u66f8\u304d\u8fbc\u307f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2DIY\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u3082\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u6587\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u88c5\u7f6e"]}

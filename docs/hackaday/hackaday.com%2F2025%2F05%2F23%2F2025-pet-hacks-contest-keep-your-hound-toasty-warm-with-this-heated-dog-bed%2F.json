Fire up the stove and the dog is there stretched out in front of it, leaving one to wonder whether our house temperature is being cruel to the mutt, or simply that they are heat sponges with infinite capacity. Theres got to be some joy in doggy circles then at the prospect of [John.r.sheahan]s heated dog bed, designed in particular with the comfort of an older dog in mind.\nIn electronics terms its a relatively low-tech project, using as it does a 12 volt electric lap blanket aimed at motorists. Its none the less a hack though, because it has a frame made of PVC pipe to hold it, and a blanked clipped in place. This forms a box-like structure above the sleeping position keeping the dog very comfortable indeed over chilly nights. Weve cared for more than one geriatric dog over the years, and can see that something like this is vital for their comfort and well-being.\nThis project is part of the 2025 Pet Hacks contest, so look out for more like it. Alternatively if your faithful friend uses something you made, why not enter yourself!\n \n\n", "title": "\u9ad8\u9f62\u72ac\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\uff01\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u72ac\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306eDIY\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "\u8001\u72ac\u306e\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u52a0\u71b1\u72ac\u7528\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u9f62\u72ac\u306b\u512a\u3057\u3044\uff01\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u72ac\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306eDIY\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "PVC\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u72ac\u7528\u6696\u623f\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff0112V\u96fb\u6c17\u6bdb\u5e03\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ac\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9", "\u5bd2\u3044\u591c\u3092\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u904e\u3054\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u72ac\u7528\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u611b\u72ac\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u3088\u3046"]}

More than a century before Zoom meetings became just another weekday burden, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) pulled off an unprecedented feat: connecting 5,100 engineers across eight cities through an elaborate telephone network. Intrigued? The IEEE, the successor of the AIEE, just published an article about it.\nThis epic event stretched telephone lines over 6,500 km, using 150,000 poles and 5,000 switches, linking major hubs like Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. John J. Carty banged the gavel at 8:30 p.m., kicking off a meeting in which engineers listened in through seat-mounted receivers\u2014no buffering or \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d moments. Even President Woodrow Wilson joined, sending a congratulatory telegram. The meeting featured breakout sessions with local guest speakers, and attendees in muted cities like Denver sent telegrams, old-school Zoom chat style.\nThe event included musical interludes with phonograph recordings of patriotic tunes\u2014imagine today\u2019s hold music, but gloriously vintage. Despite its success, this wonder of early engineering vanished from regular practice until our modern virtual meetings.\nWe wonder if Isaac Asimov knew about this when he wrote about 3D teleconferencing in 1953. If you find yourself in many virtual meetings, consider a one-way mirror."}

His recent video shows how he took a kids electric motorcycle toy and built a penny farthing bicycle. You might not know the bike by that name, but when you see it in the video below, youll recognize it. These Victorian-era bikes used a single large wheel before chain drives on a bike became a thing.\nOf course, the big part of this  literally and figuratively  is the giant front wheel. Theres a second video showing how it was built in layers using wood.\n\nThe donor toy was a Razor MX350 which is a toy dirt bike for young kids. The bike didnt work at first, so there is another video about that repair and whats inside of it.\nCould you build a copy of this? Maybe, but it looks like a lot of work. In addition, it is a lot of different kinds of work. Electrical repair, woodworking, and bending metal, at least. If you can pull it off, our hats off to you.\nNot the first hubless bike weve seen, though. The last time we saw something that looked like a Penny Farthing, it didnt look as vintage as this one, nor was it hubless.\n"}

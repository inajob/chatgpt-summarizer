When you need high power, youve either got to increase voltage or current, and currents above say 10 A require significantly beefed up components. This is how youre able to charge your laptop from your USB-C powerbank, for instance.\nOr maybe you just need higher voltages, and dont feel like using a step-up converter, which brings along with it some level of inefficiency. Whatever your reasons, its time to put some cells into series.\nNotation Confusion\nThe common notation for battery packs in parallel or series is XpYs  as in, the battery consists of Y cell stages in series, where each stage consists of X cells in parallel. So, putting three cells in series is 3s1p, a single cell is technically 1s1p, and two cells in parallel is 1s2p.\n\nA less precise but more popular notation is just showing the pack voltage  either the final charge voltage (4.1 V to 4.3 V) or the nominal voltage (3.6 V to 3.8 V) of a single cell, multiplied by the amount of series stages. For instance, if you see 12.6 V pack voltage, its exceptionally likely to be a 3s?p pack (4.2*3), and if its 14.4 V, its likely a 4s?p pack (3.6*4). This notation is less precise, because you dont know the number of cells and you have to deduce cell voltage was used for calculations, but its the one thats most often actually put on product and battery labels.\nOn one hand, the labelling is great. On the other hand, 6000mAh ( 12000mAh/2P ) 18650s dont exist.\nThis obviously becomes a problem when youre working with packs like ebike batteries. What does 52 V represent? Is it, 14 3.7 V nominal stages, or is it 12 4.3 V full-charge stages? If thats the value you see on the multimeter, is it a fully charged 12s pack, or a fully discharged 15s-17s pack? Are you comfortable taking a guess? I wouldnt be.\nFor charging and tailoring the electronics used for the battery, knowing the cell count matters a lot. So, if your battery simply states a voltage on the label, you will have to deduce the cell count before you can charge it. If you can, it might be worth to open the battery (very, very carefully) enough that you can physically count the cells and maybe even figure out the cell connections  if you can see that the pack has four-cells groups connected in parallel and you can count 60 cells in total, you have everything you need to understand its a 15s4p pack.\nHow Much Do You Really Get?\nWhat about total capacity? Lets talk that through. You will see packs use either milliamp-hours (mAh) or watt-hours (Wh) for capacity notation. When you see mAh, this is capacity per stage  the sum of capacity of all parallel cells in a single stage. Wh is the per-stage mAh multiplied by total pack voltage  typically the nominal voltage.\nTechnically, this pack is 185Wh, so you in fact wont be able to  carry a boarding\nTheres one notable exception in mAh notation talking about stages  powerbanks. Even if your powerbank has a 2s2p configuration, they will sum up mAh capacity of all cells and put that number on the label. This number is exactly twice the actual mAh capacity of the battery, though.\u00a0mAh are a primary figure for powerbank capacity marketing.\nSo heres a summary for working with unfamiliar packs. If you see that a pack says 20 Wh, you dont actually know anything about it, much less enough to charge it, but it should be easy to figure out. If you see that the pack is 120 Wh, you still dont know enough, but at least now you know that it cant be taken on a plane. Figure out the pack voltage and which kind it is  charging the battery fully and measuring the voltage should do it. Then, deduce the battery internal configuration and per-stage capacity, write them down, and maybe even put them on a sticker glued into the  if the manufacturer hasnt done it for you, someone has to do a proper job.\nIf youre designing something that can be taken on a plane, the 100 Wh limit has workarounds that you should be able to easily deduce from reading airport battery rules  I have taken flights while carrying approximately 300 Wh of batteries in my carry-on luggage. You, too, can pull such cool things off if you know enough about LiIon packs  so lets continue learning! How do you build your own pack? Lets wrap up by talking about cell selection.\nPick Your Cells Carefully\nIf youve ever taken old laptop batteries apart, you might already have an assortment of salvaged 18650 cells, and maybe youve even got few cell holders handy  if not, you should. If your plan is to be putting these cells in series, however, watch out  you cant use any random cells.\nIm going to be quite serious here and dedicate the second half of the article to this topic, because its important. If youre building a pack, the safest way to do it is taking cells that are as similar as possible before you put them together. The best way to do it is to buy a batch of cells from a reliable vendor. Not looking to do that for a particular project, maybe you need it urgently, or the budgets low? Thats understandable, lets show you what you need to know.\nFor every cell, you need to know two parameters  cell capacity and cell internal resistance. Those two need to at least approximately match if youre building a pack. Naturally, if you combine cells from different sources, theyre not going to match well. However, you can still find cells that are good enough for your use! What happens if you dont?\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\nLets look at a single parallel stage for a start. If you mismatch capacity between cells within a stage, then the stage capacity will be limited by the capacity of the cell with the lowest capacity. As soon as the lowest capacity cells energy is depleted, the cells voltage will sharply drop below safe voltage, and the cell will be charged from the other cells around it in quite unfavourable circumstances.\nIn the same parallel stage, if you mismatch the internal resistance within a stage, the lower-resistance cells will take more charge/discharge current than the others, increasing the load on it beyond what you would intend to put. Oh, and its going to heat up more, which will negatively impact its capacity/internal resistance, and heat up the cells it too, to the same effect. Both of these problems can cause the entire parallel stage to die with the cell affected  which is something you often see happen in laptops.\nWhat about differences between stages, within the series configuration of the pack? If a stage has higher internal resistance than the others, it is going to heat up more, and it is going to drop more voltage  causing an annoying dip as soon as you draw current from the pack, and increased balancing complexity during charging. This, again, is a common fault in laptops and powerbanks, as well as e-bike batteries. As for capacity, a stage with lower capacity than other stages will limit the capacity of the entire bank, causing the same kind of dip. Not only that, but if you continue drawing energy from the pack after a stages capacity has been depleted, youre going to be charging the drained stage in reverse  with potentially fiery results.\nAs you might notice, the mismatched internal resistance and capacity problems are similar, and thats because internal resistance and capacity are tightly interlinked parameters of a LiIon cell. Fortunately, theyre easy to assess.\nAssess, Configure, Equip\nThe simplest way to determine cell capacity is to get a cell tester. Those tend to be able to discharge and charge individual cells while also measuring parameters like capacity and internal resistance, and logging the results. There are quite a few cell testers, and its a popular project in the DIY scene too. You can test pouch cells the same way you would test 18650s, of course, just that it might require alligator clips or adapters.\nFailing that, you can intuit cell capacity and internal resistance with a couple of high-power resistors  basically what the testers do. After charging a cell fully, measure its voltage, then start discharging a known-value resistor through it, measuring the voltage drop. Comparing this voltage drop between cells, especially at different points in time, will give you a proxy for the cells internal resistance.\nAs for capacity, you can use a TP4056 charger to fully charge your cell and then use charging time as a proxy for capacity  you might not be able to differentiate a 3200 mAh cell and a 3100 mAh cell, but youll definitely notice a 2500 mAh cell standing out. Alternatively, you can use a resistor and note discharging time until reaching a certain voltage  while you cant estimate capacity unless youre also constantly measuring voltage, a rough estimate of discharge time will do.\nPlus, take note of cell heating! If a cell is heating up beyond norm during charge or discharge, again, consider recycling it. Cell testers and chargers tend to measure temperature for this exact reason. Again, buying a bunch of cells from the same batch is the safest thing you could do, but if you cant avoid combining cells, now you know what it takes to do so relatively safely, and what are the specific ways it can go wrong.\nToday, lets stop here, and next week, explain all the practical aspects of pack building and reuse. If you want to build a LiIon pack, which configuration do you pick? How do you charge it? What kind of protective electronics do you need? What else to watch out for? And what even is balancing? All of this and more will be explained the next week, and I hope this article can help.", "title": "\u5358\u4e00\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u7a4d\u5c64\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "body": "\u5358\u4e00\u306e\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e3.6 V\u3067\u306f\u5341\u5206\u3067\u306a\u3044\u3068\u304d\u3001LiIon\u30bb\u30eb\u3092\u7cfb\u5217\u306b\u7a4d\u307f\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u9ad8\u96fb\u529b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u3001\u96fb\u5727\u307e\u305f\u306f\u96fb\u6d41\u3092\u5897\u3084\u3059\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u306b\u3042\u308b\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u89e3\u91c8\u3082\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u5358\u4e00\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u7a4d\u5c64\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4e26\u5217\u3068\u76f4\u5217\u306e\u8868\u8a18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u610f\u5473", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u5bb9\u91cf\u3084\u5185\u90e8\u62b5\u6297\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u9078\u629e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5236\u9650\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805"]}

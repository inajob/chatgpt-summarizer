This is sort of a multi-layered story, but it gives me an opportunity to use my favorite piece of snarky IT commentary: The cloud is a fancy way to talk about someone elses servers. And when that provider has a security problem, chances are, so do you.\nThe provider in question is Snowflake, who first made the news in the Ticketmaster breach. As far as anyone can tell, Snowflake has not actually been directly breached, though it seems that researchers at Hudson Rock briefly reported otherwise. That post has not only been taken down, but also scrubbed from the wayback machine, apparently in response to a legal threat from Snowflake. Ironically, Snowflake has confirmed that one of their former employees was compromised, but Snowflake is certain that nothing sensitive was available from the compromised account.\nAt this point, it seems that the twin problems are that big organizations arent properly enforcing security policy like Two Factor Authentication, and Snowflake just doesnt provide the tools to set effective security policy. The Mandiant report indicates that all the breaches were the result of credential stealers and other credential-based techniques like credential stuffing.\nCiscos Easy Password Reset\nCisco has patched a vulnerability in the Smart Software Manager On-Prem utility, a tool that allows a business to manage their own Cisco licenses. The flaw was a pretty nasty one, where any user could change the password of any other user.\nWhile there are no workarounds, an update with the fix has been released for free. As [Dan Goodin] at Ars speculates, full administrative access to this management console could provide unintended access to all the rest of the Cisco gear in a given organization. This seems like one to get patched right away.\nBye Bye Kaspersky\nKaspersky Labs has officially started started winding down their US operations, as a direct result of the US Commerce Department ban. As a parting gift, anyone who wants it gets a free six-month subscription.\nJust a reminder, any Kaspersky installs will stop getting updates at that six-month mark, so dont forget to go on a Kaspersky uninstall spree at that time. Weve got the twin dangers, that the out-of-date antivirus could prevent another solution like Windows Defender from running, and that security products without updates are a tempting target for escalation of privilege attacks.\nUncoordinated Vulnerability Disclosure\nLets chat a bit about coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Thats the process when a researcher finds a vulnerability, privately reports it to the vendor, and together they pick a date to make the details public, usually somewhere around 90 or 120 days from disclosure. The researcher gets credit for the find, sometimes a bug bounty payout, and the vendor fixes their bug.\nThings were not always this way. Certain vendors were once well known for ignoring these reports for multiple months at a time, only to rush out a fix if the bug was exploited in the wild. This slapdash habit led directly to our current 90-day industry standard. And in turn, a strict 90-day policy is usually enough to provoke responsible behaviors from vendors.\nUsually, but not always. ZDI discovered the Internet Explorer technique that we discussed last week being used in the wild. Apparently [Haifei Li] at Check Point Research independently discovered the vulnerability, and its unclear which group actually reported it first. What is clear is that Microsoft dropped the ball on the patch, surprising both research teams and failing to credit the ZDI researcher at all. And as the ZDI post states, this isnt an isolated incident:\n\nmicrosoft: Exploit Code Unporoven\nme: i literally gave you a compiled PoC and also exploit code\nm$: No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical.\nme: pic.twitter.com/tIXJAbkRu4\n chompie (@chompie1337) June 12, 2024\n\nWhile these are Microsoft examples, there are multiple occasions from various vendors where \u201ccoordination\u201d simply means \u201cYou tell us everything you know about this bug, and maybe something will happen.\u201d\nBits and Bytes\nClarotys Team82 has documented their rather impressive entry in the 2023 Pwn2Own IoT contest. The two part series starts with a WAN side attack, targeting a routers dynamic DNS. We briefly discussed that last week. This week is the juicy details of an unauthenticated buffer overflow, leading to RCE on the device. This demonstrates the clever and terrifying trick of attacking a network from the Internet and establishing presence on an internal device.\nThere are times when you really need to see into an SSL stream, like security research or auditing. Often times thats as easy as adding a custom SSL certificate to the machines root store, so the application sees your forced HTTPS proxy as legitimate. In the case of Go, applications verify certificates independently of the OS, making this inspection much more difficult. The solution? Just patch the program to turn on the InsecureSkipVerify feature. The folks at Cyberark have dialed in this procedure, and even have a handy Python script for ease of use. Neat!\nSpeaking of tools, we were just made aware of EMBA, the EMBedded Analyzer. Thats an Open Source tool to take a look into firmware images, automatically extract useful data.\nBreaking BSOD\nJust as we were wrapping this weeks column, a rash of Windows Blue Screens of Death, BSODs, starting hitting various businesses around the world. The initial report suggests that its a Crowdstrike update gone wrong, and Crowdstrike seems to be investigating. Its reported that renaming the C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\crowdstrike folder from within safe mode will get machines booting again, but note that this is not official guidance at this point.\n\nSomething super weird happening right now: just been called by several totally different media outlets in the last few minutes, all with Windows machines suddenly BSoD\u2019ing (Blue Screen of Death). Anyone else seen this? Seems to be entering recovery mode: pic.twitter.com/DxdLyA9BLA\n Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) July 19, 2024\n", "title": "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fb5\u5bb3\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 - ATT\u304cSnowflake\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u554f\u984c\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "ATT\u304cSnowflake\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fb5\u5bb3\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002Snowflake\u306f\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u554f\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4e3b\u8981\u7d44\u7e54\u306f\u4e8c\u8981\u7d20\u8a8d\u8a3c\u3092\u9069\u5207\u306b\u65bd\u884c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002Ciscos\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u304c\u4fee\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e00\u65b9\u3001Kaspersky\u306f\u7c73\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u4e8b\u696d\u3092\u7d42\u4e86\u3002\u6f0f\u6d29\u554f\u984c\u3082\u767a\u751f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fb5\u5bb3\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 - ATT\u304cSnowflake\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u554f\u984c\u3092\u767a\u8868", "Cisco\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u8106\u5f31\u6027 - Smart Software Manager On-Prem\u3067\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u5909\u66f4\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u5bfe\u5fdc", "Kaspersky Labs\u306e\u64a4\u9000 - \u7c73\u56fd\u9023\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u898f\u5236\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3068\u7121\u6599\u7279\u5178", "\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u9069\u5207\u306a\u5171\u6709 - \u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3068\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u9593\u306e\u5354\u529b\u304c\u91cd\u8981", "IoT\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8 - Clarotys Team82\u306ePwn2Own\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u4e0d\u6b63\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc"]}

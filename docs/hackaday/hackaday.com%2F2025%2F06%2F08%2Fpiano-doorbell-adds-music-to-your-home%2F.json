To that end, [Arpan Mondal] built this neat little piano doorbell to make visiting his home just a touch more fun.\nThe heart of the build is an ESP32 microcontroller. Its responsible for reading the state of five 3D printed piano keys: three white, two black. Its nowhere near a full octave, but for a doorbell, its enough. When a key is pressed, the ESP32 plays a short audio sample embedded within the program code itself. This is done with the help of a PAM8403 audio amplifier module, which jacks up the output to drive the doorbell speaker loud enough to be heard throughout the home. Its not exactly studio quality audio, but for a doorbell, it sounds pretty solid.\nIf youre looking for a fun and easy build to make your home just a little bit more whimsical, its hard to beat something like this. Your musical friends will love it\u2014they might even develop an intro riff of their very own. Weve featured some other fun doorbell builds before, too\u2014the best of which are the Halloween projects.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u697d\u5668\uff01ESP32\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u98a8\u306e\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u97f3\u697d\u597d\u304d\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306a\u697d\u5668\uff01ESP32\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- DIY\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u500b\u6027\u7684\u306a\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u97f3\u697d\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9375\u76e4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- \u5bb6\u3092\u5f69\u308b\uff01\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u8a2a\u554f\u8005\u3092\u8fce\u3048\u3088\u3046"]}

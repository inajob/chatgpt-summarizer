Four years later this fear has become reality, as the Living Computers: Museum + Labs (LCM+L, for short) entire inventory is being auctioned off. This occurs only 12 years after the museum and associated educational facilities were opened to the public. Along with Allens collection at the LCM+L, other items that he had been collecting until his death in 2018 will also be auctioned at Christies, for a grand total of 150 items in the Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection.\nIn 2022 Allens art collection had seen the auction block, but this time it would seem that the hammer has come for this museum. Unique about LCM+L was that it featured vintage computing systems that visitors could interact with and use much like they would have been used back in the day, rather than being merely static display pieces, hence the living computers part. Although other vintage computing museums in the US and elsewhere now also allow for such interactive displays, its sad to see the only major vintage computing museum in Washington State vanish.\nHopefully the items being auctioned will find loving homes, ideally at other museums and with collectors who arent afraid to keep the educational spirit of LCM+L alive.\nThanks to [adistuder] for the tip.\nTop image: A roughly 180\u00b0 panorama of the conditioned room of the Living Computer Museum, Seattle, Washington, USA.

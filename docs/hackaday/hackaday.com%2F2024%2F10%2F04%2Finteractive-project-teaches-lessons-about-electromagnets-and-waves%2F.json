If you happened to get down to the Oregon Science Festival in the last couple of years, you might have enjoyed Catch The Wave!\u2014a public education project to teach people about electromagnets and waves. Even better, [Justin Miller] has written up how he built this exciting project.\nCatch The Wave! consists of four small tabletop cabinets. Each has physical controls and a screen, and each plays its role in teaching a lesson about electromagnets and sound waves, with a context of audio recording and playback.\nThe first station allows the user to power up an electromagnet and interact with it using paper clips. They can also see the effect it has on a nearby compass. The second illustrates how reversing current through an electromagnet can reverse its polarity, and demonstrates this by using it to swing a pendulum. The third station then ties this to the action of a speaker, which is effectively a fancy electromagnet\u2014and demonstrates how it creates sound waves in this way. Finally, the fourth station demonstrates the use of a microphone to record a voice, and throws in some wacky effects for good fun.\nIf youve ever tried to explain how sound is recorded and reproduced, youd probably have loved to had tools like these to do so. We love a good educational project around these parts, too.", "title": "\u96fb\u78c1\u77f3\u3068\u6ce2\u3092\u6559\u3048\u308b\u5c55\u793a\uff1aCatch The Wave!", "body": "\u30aa\u30ec\u30b4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u300eCatch The Wave!\u300f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u78c1\u77f3\u3068\u97f3\u6ce2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u3092\u901a\u3058\u697d\u3057\u304f\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u5c55\u793a\u7269\u3002\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u4e0a\u306e4\u3064\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u304c\u96fb\u78c1\u77f3\u3068\u97f3\u6ce2\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30c3\u30b9\u30f3\u3092\u6559\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u78c1\u77f3\u3068\u6ce2\u3092\u6559\u3048\u308b\u5c55\u793a\uff1aCatch The Wave!", "\u97f3\u97ff\u3068\u96fb\u78c1\u6c17\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff1aCatch The Wave!", "4\u3064\u306e\u5c55\u793a\u53f0\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u78c1\u6c17\u3068\u97f3\u6ce2", "\u97f3\u58f0\u9332\u97f3\u3068\u518d\u751f\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b"]}

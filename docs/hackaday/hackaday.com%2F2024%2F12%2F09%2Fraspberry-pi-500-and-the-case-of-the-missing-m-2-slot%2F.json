In a detailed review and teardown video, [Jeff Geerling] goes over all the details, and what there is to like and not like about this new product.\nThe new Raspberry Pi 500 with the new Raspberry Pi Monitor. (Credit: Jeff Geerling)\nMost of the changes relative to the RP400 are as expected, with the change to the same BCM2712 SoC as on the Raspberry Pi 5, while doubling the RAM to 8 GB and of course you get the soft power button. As [Jeff] discovers with the teardown, the odd thing is that the RP500 PCB has the footprints for an M.2 slot, as seen on the above image, but none of the components are populated.\nNaturally, [Jeff] ordered up some parts off Digikey to populate these footprints, but without luck. After asking Raspberry Pi, he was told that these footprints as well as those for a PoE feature are there for flexibility to reuse the PCB in other contexts. Sadly, it seems that these unpopulated parts of the board will have to remain just that, with no M.2 NVMe slot option built-in. With the price bump to $90 from the RP400s $70 youll have to do your own math on whether the better SoC and more RAM is worth it.\nIn addition to the RP500 itself, [Jeff] also looks at the newly launched Raspberry Pi Monitor, a 15.6 IPS display for $100. This unit comes with built-in speakers and VESA mount, but as [Jeff] notes in his review, using this VESA mount also means that youre blocking all the ports, so you have to take the monitor off said VESA mount if you want to plug in or out any cables.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u65b0\u767b\u5834\u306eRaspberry Pi 500\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "Raspberry Pi 500\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3082M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u3057\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u767b\u5834\u306eRaspberry Pi 500\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aRP500\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u5909\u66f4\u70b9", "- Raspberry Pi 500\u306e\u30c6\u30a2\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "- M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u672a\u642d\u8f09\u306eRP500\uff1a\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u306e\u8b0e", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044Raspberry Pi Monitor\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3068\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b"]}

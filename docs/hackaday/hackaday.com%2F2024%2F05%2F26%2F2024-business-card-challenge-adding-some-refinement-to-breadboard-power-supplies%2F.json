The power supply for the breadboard is often overlooked, with newcomers to electronics sometimes using a 9V battery and regulator or a cheap USB supply to get a quick 5V source. We might eventually move on to hacking together an ATX power supply, or the more affluent among us might spring for a variable, regulated bench supply, but this power supply built specifically for breadboards might thread the needle for this use case much better than other options.\nThe unique supply is hosted on a small PCB with two breakout rails that connect directly to the positive and negative pins on a standard-sized breadboard. The power supply has two outputs, each of which can output up to 24V DC and both are adjustable by potentiometers. To maintain high efficiency and lower component sizes, a switch-mode design is used to provide variable DC voltage. A three-digit, seven-segment display at the top of the board keeps track of whichever output the user selects, and the supply itself can be powered by a number of inputs, including USB-C or lithium batteries.\n\nAs an upgrade to ones own janky power supply (seen here in a project to upgrade the BIOS in an old laptop) this is an excellent step up, and of course comes in a form factor that fits into our current design contest. Of course, if you need a little more current delivering capabilities, there are some modern ATX modifications that can provide a fairly robust benchtop supply without too much expense. You can find some more information about this power supply on the projects Kickstarter page.\n \n\n", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u72ec\u81ea\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u96fb\u6e90PCB", "body": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u57fa\u76e4\u306f\u3001\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u306a24V DC\u306e2\u3064\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u3067\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002USB-C\u3084\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u304b\u3089\u7d66\u96fb\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u72ec\u81ea\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u96fb\u6e90PCB", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5411\u3051\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u306e\u958b\u767a", "24V\u53ef\u5909DC\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u96fb\u6e90\u3001USB-C\u3084\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u99c6\u52d5", "\u9ad8\u52b9\u7387\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

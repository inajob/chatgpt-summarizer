Each card in a deck can contain cozy 1-bit art, sound, interactive elements, scripted behavior, and a surprisingly large amount of other features.\nCurious? Check out the Decker guided tour to get a peek at just what Decker is capable of. Then download it and prototype an idea, create a presentation, make a game, or just doodle some 1-bit art with nice tools.\nA peek at what its like to create in Decker. Check out the online guided tour to learn more.\nDecks are saved as standalone HTML documents which execute in any web browser, making them easy to share anywhere a web page can be hosted or embedded.\nDeckers GitHub repository hosts the code, and pre-built binaries for Mac and Windows are available from the authors Itch.io page for those who would like to support with an (optional) donation.\nDoes Decker look a little familiar to you?\u00a0Decker draws strong influence from HyperCard, an atypical piece of 90s software that was a sort of graphical interface and toolset, database, and programming language all rolled into one. Weve seen HyperCard used to make a game engine, but Decker looks like a much more modern and friendly way to scratch the same itch."}

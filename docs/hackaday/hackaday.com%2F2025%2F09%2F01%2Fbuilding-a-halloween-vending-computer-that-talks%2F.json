Its the photoelectric sensor which triggers the mask to speak.\n\nThe vending mechanism is a wheel that spins, the bouncy balls caught in a hole on the wheel, then fall through a vending tube. The cache of prizes are stored in a clear container attached to the top, which is secured with a keyed lock attached to the 3D printed lid. After unlocking the lid can be removed for restocking.\nThe whole device is built into an old PC case tower. The back panels have been replaced and sealed. The computer in the box is an ASUS CN60 Chromebox running Ubuntu Linux. The power button is obscured on the back of the case to avoid accidental pressing. The monitor is bolted on to the side panel with a perspex screen and connected to the Chromebox via VGA. Inside there are two power supplies, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and an audio amplifier attached to a pair of speakers.\nA 12V DC motor controls the vending prize wheel which feeds a prize into the vending tube. The vending tube has an LED on one side and a photoresistor on the other side that detects the vend. The software, running on Linux, is Python code using the Pygame library.\nIf youre interested in vending machines you might also be interested in this one: This Vending Machine Is For The Birds.\n\nThanks to [Adam] for writing in about this one."}

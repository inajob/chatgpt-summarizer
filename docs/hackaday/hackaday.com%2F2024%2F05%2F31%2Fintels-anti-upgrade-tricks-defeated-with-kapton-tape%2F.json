Even the CPU sockets pinout is different in the next generation  we are told, it will fit the same socket, but it wont boot. So if you want a newer CPU, youll have to buy a new motherboard while youre at it. Or do you?\nTurns out, the difference in the socket is just a few pins here and there, and you can make a 8th or 9th generation Coffee Lake CPU work on your Z170/270 board if you apply a few Kapton tape fixes and mod your BIOS, in a process you can find as Coffee Mod. You can even preserve compatibility with the 6th/7th generation CPUs after doing this mod, should you ever need to go back to an older chip. Contrasting this to AMDs high degree of CPU support on even old Ryzen motherboards, its as if Intel introduced this incompatibility intentionally.\nTheres been a number of posts on various PC forums and YouTube videos, going through the process and showing off the tools used to modify the BIOS. Some mods are exceptionally easy to apply. For example, if you have the Asus Maximus VIII Ranger motherboard, a single jumper wire between two pads next to the EC will enable support without Kapton tape, a mod that likely could be figured out for other similar motherboards as well. Theres a few aspects to keep in mind, like making sure your boards VRMs are good enough for the new chip, and a little more patching might be needed for hyper-threading, but nothing too involved.\nBetween money-grab features like this that hamper even the simplest of upgrades and increase e-waste, fun vulnerabilities, and inability to sort out problems like stability power consumption issues, its reassuring to see users take back control over their platforms wherever possible, and brings us back to the days of modding Xeon CPUs to fit into 775 sockets.\nDont get too excited though, as projects like Intel BootGuard are bound to hamper mods like this on newer generations by introducing digital signing for BIOS images, flying under the banner of user security yet again. Alas, it appears way more likely that Intels financial security is the culprit.\n\n\nWe thank [Lexi] for sharing this with us!"}

One goal of this being to put together a PDP-11 system that could be more easily taken to vintage computer shows than the rollable PDP-11s he had access to prior. Of 1980s PDP-11s, the first-generation Large Scale Integration (LSI) PDP11/03 system (so-called Q-Bus models) is among the smallest, taking up about as much space as a 1980s desktop PC, while supporting the second generation LSI PDP-11/23 cards. It all seemed so easy until [David] tried testing the PDP-11/03s PSU and everything went south.\nDespite having access to the circuit diagrams of the PSU, figuring out what was going wrong was an absolute nightmare for [David], after some easy fixes involving replacing a blown fuse and bulging capacitors failed to deliver salvation. Reading through the comments to the video, it would seem that people are generally confused about whether this PSU is a linear, switching or some other configuration. What is clear is that with the absolutely massive transformer, it looks more like a linear power supply, but with a lot of protections against over current and other failure modes built-in, all of which rely on transistors and other components that could have gone bad.\nAlthough in round 1 the PDP-11/03 PSU won the battle, we hope that once round 2 commences [David] will have had the proverbial training montage behind him (set to Eye of the Usagi, probably) and will manage to get this PSU working once more.\n\n", "title": "DEC PDP-11\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001Usagi Electric\u306eDavid Lovett\u6c0f\u304c\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u6311\u6226", "body": "[David Lovett]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u591a\u7a2e\u591a\u69d8\u306aDEC PDP-11\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u308a\u3001\u307e\u3060\u6570\u53f0\u3092\u6240\u6709\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u306fPDP-11\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u306b\u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001PSU\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u5931\u6557\u3057\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u56f0\u96e3\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["DEC PDP-11\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001Usagi Electric\u306eDavid Lovett\u6c0f\u304c\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u6311\u6226", "PDP-11/03\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u56de\u5fa9\u7b56\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "PDP-11/03\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u306b\u6311\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6", "PDP-11/03\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6545\u969c\u4fee\u5fa9\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u308b\u3082\u3001\u56f0\u96e3\u304c\u4e88\u60f3\u3055\u308c\u308b", "PDP-11/03\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3078\u5411\u3051\u3066\u306e\u7b2c2\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3092\u671f\u5f85\u3059\u308b"]}

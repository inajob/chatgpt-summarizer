[Dereksgc] puts that reputation to the test by building a helical WiFi antenna  and if that werent enough  he also subjects it to a field test. In a real field, is there any other way?\nWeve put both videos below the break, and you can find his helical antenna calculator on his website and the parametric CAD file for the scaffold in his GitHub repository. He first delivers a crash course in the fundamentals of helical antennas before diving into the construction, and even soldering on an impedance matching strip. The field testing involves setting up a base station with an FTP server on a phone, and connecting to it with a variety of antennas over increasing distance across farmland. Weve characterised antennas in this way before, and it really does give an immediate view of their performance.\nIn this case the helix comfortably outperforms a commercial patch antenna and a laptops internal antenna, making such an antenna a very worthwhile piece of work whether youre making a fixed link or indulging in a bit of casual wardriving.\nThe tools mentioned here will make helical antennas a snap, but this isnt the first time weve touched on the subject.\n\n\n"}

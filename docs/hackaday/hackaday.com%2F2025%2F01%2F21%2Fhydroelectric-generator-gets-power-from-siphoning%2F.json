Thanks to atmospheric pressure, simply filling a tube with liquid and placing the end of the tube below the liquid level of a container allows it to flow against gravity, over a barrier, and down into another container without any extra energy inputs once the siphon is started. Theyre not just tricks, though; siphons have practical applications as well, such as in siphon-powered hydroelectric turbine.\nThis is an iteration of [Beyond the Print]s efforts to draw useful energy from a local dam with an uneconomic amount of water pressure and/or volume for a typical hydroelectric power station. One of his earlier attempts involved a water wheel but this siphon-based device uses a more efficient impeller design instead, and it also keeps the generator dry as well. Using 3 PVC piping to channel the siphon, as well as a short length of thinner pipe to attach a shop vac for priming the siphon, water is drawn from the reservoir, up the pipe, and then down through the impeller which spins a small DC generator.\nThis design is generating about 9 V open-circuit, and wed assume theres enough power available to charge a phone or power a small microcontroller device. However, theres a ton of room for improvement here. The major problem [Beyond the Print] is currently experiencing is getting air into the system and having the siphon broken, which hes solved temporarily by adding a bucket at the outflow. This slows down the water though, so perhaps with any air leaks mitigated the power generation capabilities will be greatly increased.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u91cd\u529b\u306b\u9006\u3089\u3046\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u73fe\u8c61", "body": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306f\u91cd\u529b\u306b\u9006\u3089\u3063\u3066\u6db2\u4f53\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3055\u305b\u308b\u73fe\u8c61\u3067\u3001\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306b\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u91cd\u529b\u306b\u9006\u3089\u3046\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u73fe\u8c61", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u529b\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- PVC\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u5c0f\u578bDC\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u529b\u751f\u6210\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u7a7a\u6c17\u6f0f\u308c\u554f\u984c\u3068\u6539\u5584\u7b56\u306e\u6a21\u7d22"]}

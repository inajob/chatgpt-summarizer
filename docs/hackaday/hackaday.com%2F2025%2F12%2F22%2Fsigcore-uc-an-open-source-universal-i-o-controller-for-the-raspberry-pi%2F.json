Features include Ethernet, WiFi, and Modbus TCP connectivity, regulated 5 V bus, eight relays, eight digital inputs, four analog inputs, and four analog outputs. All packaged in rugged housing and ready for installation/deployment.\n[Edward] says he wanted something which went beyond development boards and expansion modules that provided a complete and ready-to-deploy solution. If youre interested in the hardware, firmware, or software, everything is available on the projects GitHub page. Beyond the Hackaday.io article, the GitHub repo, the YouTube explainer video, there is even an entire website devoted to the project: sigcoreuc.com. Our hats off to [Edward], he really put a lot of polish on this project.\nIf youre interested in using the Raspberry Pi for input/output you might also like to read about Raspberry Pi Pico Makes For Expeditious Input Device and Smart Power Strip Revived With Raspberry Pi.\n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u5411\u3051\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9I/O\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u300cSigCore UC\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30a8\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30df\u30c3\u30c4\u304cRaspberry Pi\u5411\u3051\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u5668\u300cSigCore UC\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u5c55\u958b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u5411\u3051\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9I/O\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u300cSigCore UC\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\uff01\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0I/O\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u6c4e\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "- \u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u7523\u696d\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300cSigCore UC\u300d\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30a8\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3001\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

The end result is a delightful jump scare, and the Raspberry Pi that controls everything also captures peoples reactions.\nIt starts with a little twitch when motion is sensed, then launches into a perfectly unsettling quiver combined with light and sound. We particularly like the wave-like effect from the LED lighting, which calls to mind illumination from rotating hazard beacons.\nThe unit looks like a mounted and tastefully-lit static model, but is actually primed to sense motion.\nOne challenge was how to efficiently move the legs. Rather than use a motor for each limb, [Jason] settled on a single motor driving a rotating cam arrangement. You can see the results for yourself in the video below, but getting there was not simple.\nThe surplus motor [Jason] chose is thin and high-torque, but runs extremely fast. Since he wanted the legs to quiver creepily rather than vibrate, something needed to be done to mitigate this.\nThe solution is a planetary gear assembly that drives a rotating ring and cam arrangement coupled to the facehuggers legs. Theres only one motor, but the effect is that each legs motion is independent of the others. The whole assembly is quite slim, and everything is contained within the frame.\nFacehuggers and gear assemblies are not exactly an everyday combination, but believe it or not this isnt the first time the two have joined forces.

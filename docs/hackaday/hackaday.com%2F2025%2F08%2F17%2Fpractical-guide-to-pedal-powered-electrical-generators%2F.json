In a recent article on EDN [T. K. Hareendran] goes over a few ways that you can turn the rotary motion of pedaling into usable electrical power.\nSuggested voltage regulator for pedal-powered generator. (Credit: T. K. Hareendran, EDN)\nA basic form of this is already widely deployed, in the form of a bicycle dynamo that is used to supply power to the front and rear lights. These typically put out something like 3 watts at 6 VAC, so with a simple bridge rectifier and some smoothing this can power a pretty bright LED or two. To get more out of it, you need to use a more capable generator, which can also be a brushed or brushless DC motor in a pinch, with ideally a flywheel in the whole contraption to balance out variations in the human power input.\nAs for the potential here, a commercial solution like the K-Tor Power Box 50 is specified for greater than 50 Watt, with a nominal 12 VDC output. Its target market is emergency generators, with enough capability to keep phones, radios and flashlights charged. Considering the $435 asking price, there is probably quite a lot of DIY potential well within that price bracket, especially if you already have many of the requisite parts lying around.\nFortunately this is not a new idea, with us having covered using bicycles as well as gym equipment to generate electricity in the past.", "title": "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30da\u30c0\u30eb\u3067\u767a\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3084\u904b\u52d5\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u767a\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30da\u30c0\u30eb\u3067\u767a\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30e2\u304b\u3089LED\u7167\u660e\u307e\u3067", "- \u30da\u30c0\u30eb\u5f0f\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u767a\u96fb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

That seems to be exactly what happened to [Penguin DIY].\nIn the mesmerizing video after the break, youll see [Penguin DIY] do what seems to be impossible. They start with a tiny 5 V power bank module which is still not small enough to fit, so they remove all the components and dead-bug them back together.\nThis is really just the beginning. There of course has to be a female USB of some type, so [Penguin DIY] Dremels out the perfect little slot for it.\nThey did manage to stack and fit a MH-MH18 Bluetooth audio module and an HXJ8002 mini audio amplifier module in the walnut, but of course, it took a lot of fiddly wiring to extend the LEDs and wire them up.\nThen in the other half of the shell went the 4\u03a9 2 W mini speaker. [Penguin DIY] of course drilled a ton of little holes in the shell for the sound to come through. Also on this side are three tiny switches for play/pause and previous and next track, and the latter two can be long pressed to control the volume. Definitely check this out after the break.\nDo the notifications of your Bluetooth speaker annoy you? Theres a hack for that.\n\n\nThanks for the tip, [Hyperific]!"}

But [Elli]\u2019s Hackaday Supercon talk isn\u2019t just about the hardware; it\u2019s as much about the design philosophy behind the game \u2013 how you bring something immersive and exciting to hundreds of players.\nSandbox Systems\nThe game itself is fairly simple: bounty hunters try to find the bounty, and when they do, they have a quick-draw to see who wins. Everyone is issued a color-coded Portable Data Node device, and when a hunter jacks into a bounty\u2019s Node, a countdown begins, and the first to press the button after the display say \u201cGo\u201d wins.\nBut the simplicity of the game is by design, and [Elli] talks about the philosophy that she and her team followed to make it a success. If you\u2019re designing a conference badge or an immersive game for a large group of people, take note.\nThe first principle is to focus on the people first before the tech. Here, that essentially means making the experience as simple as possible in order to leave room for the players to put their own spin on it \u2013 it\u2019s a role-play event after all.\nNext is providing opportunities over demands. In this game, for instance, if you\u2019re playing the bounty hunter role, you have to deliver a \u201cDeclaration of Intent to Seize\u201d when you encounter a bounty player, but what deciding on your personal catchphrase for this is left up to you.\nEmbedding the rules of the game in the hardware is perhaps the most involved of the principles. The Data Nodes decide the winner and the loser, report it automatically over WiFi to a central scoreboard, and has anti-button-mashing provisions. These and many more examples of embedding the rules help make the game both fair and simple \u2013 nobody has to break the flow to look things up in a rule book or remember who gives what token to whom.\nSelling the story of the game with the tech is also important. For instance, there is a part of the Node that [Elli] calls \u201cthe doodad\u201d which is just pure LED and greebles. It doesn\u2019t do anything, but it looks cool.\nFinally, [Elli] mentions that her team puts an effort into making the game as accessible for everyone as possible. The onboarding video has cyberpunk-styled closed captioning, for instance. While originally designed for folks who don\u2019t hear well, it ended up providing an aesthetic that everyone can enjoy \u2013 an example of the curb-cut effect at work.\nThe end result? 374 players played 3,838 matches over five days, but that\u2019s just the stats. As [Elli] points out, the real point of the game is as an ice-breaker, to allow people room to explore whatever character they\u2019re playing, and to connect people in real-space. It sounds like it was a complete success on all fronts.\nThe Sandbox\nThis is a talk on design principles, but it\u2019s also a talk at Supercon, and [Elli] gets pulled into the hardware side of things many times throughout the talk. The Nodes have OLEDs and haptic motors for feedback, they use and ESP32 with WiFi for the score reporting, and there\u2019s even discussion of the serial protocol that they speak to each other when they get connected up via an audio jack.\n[Elli] gets some great questions about ways to expand the game, and you\u2019re just going to have to watch the video to appreciate them all. Or join in: after all, it\u2019s an open-source project and it\u2019s intended to be a sandbox!\nThere seems to be a lot of room to play along, and [Elli]\u2019s talk is definitely food for thought if you\u2019re designing hardware with the end goal of creating and encouraging human interaction through building up an engaging story.\n"}

The LCD screen has been stripped of its backlight, allowing you to verify that the plot exactly matches the screen by staring through it. The screen flashes red for a sec, and your art is then dispensed. It\u2019s lovely mechatronic theater. We also dig the \u201cprogress bar\u201d that is represented by how much of your one Euro\u2019s worth of art it has plotted so far. And it seems to track perfectly; Bill Gates could learn something from watching this. Be sure to check out the build log to see how it all came together.\nYou\u2019d be forgiven if you expected some AI to be behind the scenes these days, but the algorithm is custom designed by [Niklas] himself, ironically adding to the sense of humanity behind it all. It takes the Unix epoch timestamp as the seed to generate a whole bunch of points, then it connects them together. Each piece is unique, but of course it\u2019s also reproducible, given the timestamp. We\u2019re not sure where this all lies in the current debates about authenticity and ownership of art, but that\u2019s for the comment section.\nIf you want to see more of [Niklas]\u2019s work, well this isn\u2019t the first time his contraptions have graced our pages. But just last weekend at Hackaday Europe was the first time that he\u2019s ever given us a talk, and it\u2019s entertaining and beautiful. Go check that out next.\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oneEuroGenerativeArt.mp4", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30cb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "\u30cb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u751f\u6210\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6255\u3044\u8fbc\u307f\u5f8c\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u753b\u9762\u304b\u3089\u5370\u5237\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30cb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u304a\u91d1\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u552f\u4e00\u7121\u4e8c\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046", "- \u898b\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01LCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u30cb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0", "- Hackaday Europe\u3067\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u3082\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30cb\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u4e16\u754c"]}

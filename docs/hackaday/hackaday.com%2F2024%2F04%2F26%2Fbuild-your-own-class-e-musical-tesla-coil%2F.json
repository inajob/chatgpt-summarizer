[Zach Armstrong] wasnt content to just watch, though. He went out and built one himself! Even better, hes built a guide for the rest of us, too!\nHis guide concerns the construction of a Class-E solid state Tesla coil. These are underrated in his opinion, as theyre simple, cheap, and incredibly efficient. Some say up to 95% efficient, in fact! Its not something most Tesla coil fans are concerned with, but its nice to save the environment while making fun happy sparks, after all.\n[Zach]s guide doesnt just slap down a schematic and call it good. He explains the theory behind it, and the unique features too. He uses an adjustable Schmitt trigger oscillator for the build, and hes naturally given it an audio modulation capability because thats a good laugh, too.\nIf youve ever wanted to convince youre friends youre incredibly smart and science-y, you cant go wrong with a singing Tesla coil. This beats out Jacobs ladder and most other plasma experiments for sheer mad scientist cred.\nHave fun out there! Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30af\u30e9\u30b9E\u56fa\u4f53\u578b\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "Zach Armstrong\u306f\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eClass-E\u56fa\u4f53\u72b6\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u5909\u8abf\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u9b45\u529b\u6e80\u70b9\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306b\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002", "titles": ["\u30af\u30e9\u30b9E\u56fa\u4f53\u578b\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u97f3\u58f0\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u9ad8\u52b9\u7387\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u6f14\u51fa", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u904a\u307c\u3046"]}

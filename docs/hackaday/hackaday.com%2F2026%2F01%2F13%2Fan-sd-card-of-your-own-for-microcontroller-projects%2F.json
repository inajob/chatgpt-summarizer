Compared to other ways of holding data on your project, SD cards are just so much cheaper, resilient to physical and magnetic shocks, and simpler to work with from both a hardware and software perspective. On the other hand, it might seem silly to put a SD card slot on a board thats never going to see a replacement card. [DIY GUY Chris] wants to advertise a solution for that: a cardless SD card chip by XTX that can act as a drop-in replacement for your projects.\u00a0\nThe XTXD0*G series are NAND flash chips of precisely the sort youd find in an SD card, except without the SD card. That means you can use your usual SD card access libraries to speed prototyping, but skip the BOM cost of an actual card reader. In his Instructable and the video embedded below [Chris] shows how he used the 4 GB version, the XTSD04GLGEAG to make a custom SD-compatible breakout board that is equally happy in your laptops card reader or on a breadboard.\nTo get it plugged into the breadboard, [Chris] is using the standard 2.54 mm headers you can get anywhere; to get it plugged into a card reader, hes just relying on the PCB being cut to shape. [Chris] notes that youll want to have the board built at 0.6 mm thickness if youre going to plug it in like a micro SD card.\nOf course once youve gotten used to the little NAND chips, theres no need to put them on breakouts but this looks like a fun way to test em out. You dont need to keep your flash chip on an SD-card sized PCB, either; we saw something similar used to make modern game cartridges.\u00a0If you insist on using a standard SD card and dont want to buy a slot, you can certainly DIY that instead.\u00a0\n\n"}

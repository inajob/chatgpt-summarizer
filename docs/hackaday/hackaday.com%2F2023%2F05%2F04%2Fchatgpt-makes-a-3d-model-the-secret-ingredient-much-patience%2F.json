While using it, [Gil Meiri] discovered that one way to create models in FreeCAD is with Python scripting, and ChatGPT could be encouraged to create a 3D model of a plane in FreeCAD by expressing the model as a script. The result is just a basic plane shape, and it certainly took a lot of guidance on [Gil]s part to make it happen, but its not bad for a tool that cant see what it is doing.\nThe first step was getting ChatGPT to create code for a 10 mm cube, and plug that in FreeCAD to see the results. After that basic workflow was shown to work, [Gil] asked it to create a simple airplane shape. The resulting code had objects for wing, fuselage, and tail, but thats about all that could be said because the result was almost  but not quite  completely unlike a plane. Not an encouraging start, but at least the basic building blocks were there.\nWhat followed was a lot of back-and-forth where [Gil] would give direction and feedback like the fuselage is in the wrong orientation, please re-write the code to move it or the wings are too large, please change the code to make them smaller. Progress was slow, but with patient guidance ChatGPT eventually went from some nearly-random shapes to a basic plane model. The image on the left represents the first attempt, the middle shows the correct basic shapes lacking relative orientation, and the last image is the final result.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Gil] decided to 3D print the result to cap off the experiment, thus creating as a physical object a 3D model that was generated in FreeCAD by ChatGPT, thanks to human guidance. Weve seen ChatGPT create objects in OpenSCAD, also thanks to leveraging a text-based method of defining 3D objects. Maybe the results are not going to wow any crowds right now, but by this time next year it might be a different story.", "title": "ChatGPT\u3068Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30673D\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u4f1a\u8a71\u5c02\u7528\u306eAI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306eChatGPT\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066FreeCAD\u3067\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002ChatGPT\u306e\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5f93\u3063\u3066\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u6700\u521d\u306e\u8a66\u307f\u306f\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6307\u5c0e\u3068\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u5230\u9054\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30923D\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["ChatGPT\u3068Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30673D\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "ChatGPT\u304cFreeCAD\u30673D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "ChatGPT\u306b\u3088\u308b3D\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u306e\u9053\u306e\u308a", "ChatGPT\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u6307\u5c0e\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001FreeCAD\u30673D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u751f\u6210", "ChatGPT\u304c3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u5e02\u5834\u3092\u5e2d\u5dfb\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

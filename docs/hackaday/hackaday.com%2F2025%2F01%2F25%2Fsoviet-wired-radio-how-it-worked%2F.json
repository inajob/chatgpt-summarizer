On the other side in the Soviet Union, radio for many came without a choice of source, in the form of wired radio systems built into all apartments. [Railways | Retro Tech | DIY] grew up familiar with these wired radios, and treats us to a fascinating examination of their technology, programming, and ultimate decline.\nIn a Soviet apartment, usually in the kitchen, there would be a Radio socket on the wall. Confusingly the same physical dimension as a mains socket, it carried an audio signal. The box which plugged into it was referred to as a radio, but instead contained only a transformer, loudspeaker, and volume control. These carried the centralised radio station, piped from Moscow to the regions by a higher voltage line, then successively stepped down at regional, local, and apartment block level. A later refinement brought a couple more stations on separate sub-carriers, but it was the single channel speakers which provided the soundtrack for daily life.\nThe decline of the system came over the decades following the end of communism, and he describes its effect on the mostly older listenership. Now the speaker boxes survive as affectionate curios for those like him who grew up with them.\nYou probably wont be surprised to find twisted-wire broadcasting in use in the West, too.\n\n\nThanks [Stephen Walters] for the tip.", "title": "- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u300c\u6709\u7dda\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u300d\u306e\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u51b7\u6226\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30bd\u9023\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6709\u7dda\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u304c\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u306a\u3057\u3002\u5171\u7523\u4e3b\u7fa9\u5d29\u58ca\u5f8c\u3001\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u8870\u9000\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u300c\u6709\u7dda\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u300d\u306e\u6280\u8853", "- \u4e2d\u592e\u96c6\u6a29\u7684\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u6587\u5316\u3068\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u97f3\u97ff", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u5d29\u58ca\u5f8c\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8870\u9000", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\uff1a\u304b\u3064\u3066\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306b\u5bc4\u305b\u308b\u601d\u3044"]}

If you are in the former camp, or you just want to improve your shell prompt, have a look at Starship. It works on the most common shells on most operating systems, so you can use it everywhere you go, within reason. It has the advantage of being fast and you can also customize it all that you want.\nWhat Does It Look Like?\nIt is hard to explain exactly what the Starship prompt looks like. First, you can customize it almost infinitely, so theres that. Second, it adapts depending on where you are. So, for example, in a git-controlled directory, you get info about the git status unless youve turned that off. If you are in an ssh session, youll see different info than if you are logged in locally.\nHowever, heres a little animation from their site that will give you an idea of what you might expect:\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/demo.webm\nInstallation\nThe web site says you need a Nerd Font in your terminal. I didnt remember doing that on purpose, but apparently I had one already.\nNext, you just have to install using one of the methods they provide, which depends on your operating system. For Linux, you can run the installer:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh\n\n\nSure, you should download it first and look to make sure it wont reformat your hard drive or something, but it was fine when we did it.\nFinally, you have to run an init command. How you do that depends on your shell and they have plenty of examples. Theres even a way to use it with cmd.exe on Windows!\nCustomization\nThe default isnt bad but, of course, you are going to want to change things. Oddly, the system doesnt create a default configuration file. It just behaves a certain way if it doesnt find one. You must make your own ~/.config/starship.toml file. You can change where the file lives using an environment variable, if you prefer, but you still have to create it.\nThe TOML file format has sections like an INI file. Just be aware that any global options have to come before any section (that is, theres no [global] tag). If you put things towards the bottom of the file, they wont seem to work and it is because they have become part of the last tag.\nThere are a number of modules and each module reads data from a different section. For example, on my desktop I have no need for battery status so:\n\nbattery]\ndisabled = true\n\nStrings\nIn the TOML file you can use single or double quotes. You can also triple a quote to make a string break lines (but the line breaks are not part of the string). The single quotes are treated as a literal, while double quotes require escape characters for special things.\nYou can use variables in strings like $version or $git_branch. You can also place part of a string in brackets and then formating for the string in parenthesis immediately following. For example:\n\noff](fg:red bold)\n\nFinally, you can have a variable print only if it exists:\n (#$id)\n\nIf $id is empty, this does nothing. Otherwise, it will print the # and the value.\nGlobals and Modules\nYou can find all the configuration options  and there are many  in the Starship documentation. Of primary interest is the global format variable. This sets each module that is available. However, you can also use $all to get all the otherwise unspecified modules. By default, the format variable starts with $username $hostname. Suppose you wanted it to be different. You could write:\n\nformat=$hostname ! $username $all\n\nYoull find many modules that show the programming language used for this directory, version numbers, and cloud information. You can shut things off, change formatting, or rearrange. Some user-submitted customizations are available, too. Cant find a module to do what you want? No problem.\nSuper Custom\nI wanted to show the status of my watercooler, so I created a custom section in the TOML file:\n\n\ncustom.temp]\ncommand = temp-status|grep temp|cut -d   -f 7\nwhen = true\nformat=$output\u00b0\n\nThe command output winds up in, obviously, $output. In this case, I always want the module to output and the format entry prints the output with a degree symbol after it. Easy!\nOf Course, There are Always Others\nThere are other prompt helpers out there, especially if you use zsh (e.g., Oh My Zsh). However, if you arent on zsh, your options are more limited. Oh My Posh is another cross-shell entry into the field. Of course, you dont absolutely need any of these. They work because shells give you variables like PS1 and PROMPT_COMMAND, so you can always roll your own to be as simple or complex as you like. People have been doing their own for a very long time.\nIf you want to do your own for bash, you can get some help online. Or, you could add help to bash, too.", "title": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u6642\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\uff01Starship\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Starship\u306f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u9ad8\u901f\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u6642\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\uff01Starship\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "Git\u7ba1\u7406\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u3067\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u8868\u793a\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u306aStarship\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "Linux\u3068Windows\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01Starship\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "TOML\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3059\u308bStarship\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u3084\u74b0\u5883\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bStarship\u306e\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

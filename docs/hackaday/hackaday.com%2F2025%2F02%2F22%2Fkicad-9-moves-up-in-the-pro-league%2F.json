Has KiCad been just a tiny bit insufficient for your lightning-fast board routing demands? Weve just been graced with the KiCad 9 release (blog post, theres a FOSDEM talk too), and it brings features of the rank you expect from a professional-level monthly-subscription PCB design suite.\nOf course, KiCad 9 has delivered a ton of polish and features for all sorts of PCB design, so everyone will have some fun new additions to work with  but if you live and breathe PCB track routing, this release is especially for you.\n\nOne of the most flashy features is multichannel design  essentially, if you have multiple identical blocks on your PCB, say, audio amplifiers, you can now route it once and then replicate the routing in all other blocks; a stepping stone for design blocks, no doubt.\nOther than that, theres a heap of additions  assigning net rules in the schematic, dragging multiple tracks at once, selectively removing soldermask from tracks and tenting from vias, a zone fill manager, in/decrementing numbers in schematic signal names with mousewheel scroll, alternate function display toggle on symbol pins, improved layer selection for layer switches during routing, creepage and acute angle DRC, DRC marker visual improvements, editing pad and via stacks, improved third-party imports (specifically, Eagle and Altium schematics), and a heap of other similar pro-level features big and small.\nRegular hackers get a load of improvements to enjoy, too. Ever wanted to add a table into your schematic? Now thats doable out of the box. How about storing your fonts, 3D models, or datasheets directly inside your KiCad files? This, too, is now possible in KiCad. The promised Python API for the board editor is here, output job templates are here (think company-wide standardized export settings), theres significantly more options for tweaking your 3D exports, dogbone editor for inner contour milling, big improvements to footprint positioning and moving, improvements to the command line interface (picture rendering in mainline!), and support for even more 3D export standards, including STL. Oh, add to that, export of silkscreen and soldermask into 3D models  finally!\nApart from that, theres, of course, a ton of bugfixes and small features, ~1500 new symbols, ~750 footprints, and, documentation has been upgraded to match and beyond. KiCad 10 already has big plans, too  mostly engine and infrastructure improvements, making KiCad faster, smarter, and future-proof, becoming even more of impressive software suite and a mainstay on an average hackers machine.\nFor example, KiCad 10 will bring delay matching, Git schematic and PCB integrations, PNG plot exports, improved diffpair routers, autorouter previews, design import wizard, DRC and length calculation code refactoring, part height support, and a few dozen other things!\nWe love that KiCad updates yearly now. Every FOSDEM, we get an influx of cool new features into the stable KiCad tree. Were also pretty glad about the ongoing consistent funding they get  may they get even more, in fact. Weve been consistently seeing hackers stop paying for proprietary PCB software suites and switching to KiCad, and hopefully some of them have redirected that money into a donation towards their new favorite PCB design tool.\nJoin the pro club, switch to the new now-stable KiCad 9! If you really enjoy it and benefit from it, donate, or even get some KiCad merch. Want to learn more about the new features? Check out the release blog post (many cool animations and videos there!), or the running thread on KiCad forums describing the new featuresfixes in length, maybe if youre up for video format, check out the KiCad 9 release talk recording (29m48s) from this years FOSDEM, its worth a watch."}

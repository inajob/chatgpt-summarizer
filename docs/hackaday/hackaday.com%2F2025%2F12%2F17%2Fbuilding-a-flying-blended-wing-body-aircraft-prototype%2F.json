That said, they recently got the offer to build a flying prototype of the Natilus Horizon, a blended wing body (BWB) aircraft thats currently being developed into a full-sized production aircraft.\nSuffice it to say that BWB RC aircraft isnt something that they have built before, but as co-founder of Natilus, [Aleksey Matyushev], explains, they want to prove in this manner that building scale prototypes of future production aircraft is not nearly as complex as its often made out to be. Meaning that even two blokes in a shed as is the case here should be able to pull it off.\nNatilus was founded in 2016 amidst strongly rising interest in these BWB aircraft designs that may one day threaten todays tubes-with-wings. Their\u00a0Kona design would be the cargo version and this Horizon prototype that [Ramy RC] is building the passenger version.\nIn this first video of two total, we can see the CAD project of the prototype and how the basic aircraft structure is being constructed out of carbon fiber composite, wood and foam. To this the engine nacelles, landing gear and wings are mounted, readying it for its maiden flight. The Natilus engineers have previously done all the simulations that should mean that itll fly like a glider, but we will have to wait until the next video to see whether that is the case.\n\n", "title": "- \u5927\u578b\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1aNatilus\u30db\u30e9\u30a4\u30be\u30f3\u306e\u98db\u884c\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3059\u308b[Ramy RC]\u304c\u3001Natilus Horizon\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306aBWB\u6a5f\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5927\u578b\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1aNatilus\u30db\u30e9\u30a4\u30be\u30f3\u306e\u98db\u884c\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c", "- BWB\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u4e8c\u4eba\u306eDIY\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u304c\u6311\u3080\uff01Natilus\u306e\u65b0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3068\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u4f5c\u308bBWB\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u69cb\u9020", "- \u98db\u884c\u6e96\u5099\u5b8c\u4e86\uff01\u521d\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u5f85\u3064Natilus\u30db\u30e9\u30a4\u30be\u30f3\u306e\u6982\u8981"]}

(Credit: Three-phase, YouTube)\nResistance standards are incredibly useful, but like so many precision references they require regular calibration, maintenance and certification to ensure that they stay within their datasheet tolerances. This raises the question of how well a resistance standard from the year 1900 performs after 125 years, without the benefits of modern modern engineering and standards. Cue the [Three-phase] YouTube channel testing a genuine Evershed  Vignoles Ltd one ohm resistance standard from 1900.\nWith mahogany construction and brass contacts it sure looks stylish, though the unit was missing the shorting pin that goes in between the two sides. This was a common feature of e.g. resistance decade boxes of the era, where you inserted pins to connect resistors until you hit the desired total. Inside the one ohm standard is a platinoid resistor, which is an alloy of copper, nickel, tungsten, and zinc. Based on the broad arrow mark on the bottom this unit was apparently owned by the UKs Ordnance Board, which was part of what was then called the War Office.\nAfter a quick gander at the internals, the standard was hooked up to a Keithley DMM7510 digital bench meter. The resistance standards datasheet is listed on top of the unit on the brass plaques, including the effect of temperature on its accuracy. Adjusting for this, the measured ~1.016 \u03a9 was within 1.6% tolerance, with as sidenote that this was with the unit not having been cleaned or otherwise having had maintenance performed on it since it was last used in service. Definitely not a bad feat.\n\n", "title": "1900\u5e74\u88fdEvershed Vignoles\u306e1\u30aa\u30fc\u30e0\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "body": "1900\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u306a\u3057\u3067125\u5e74\u5f8c\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u304b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3002\u7d041.016\u03a9\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1900\u5e74\u88fdEvershed Vignoles\u306e1\u30aa\u30fc\u30e0\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "\u7cbe\u5bc6\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u7dad\u6301\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027", "125\u5e74\u5f8c\u306e\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3059\u308b", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u62b5\u6297\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u5b9f\u6e2c\u5024\u306e\u8a55\u4fa1\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

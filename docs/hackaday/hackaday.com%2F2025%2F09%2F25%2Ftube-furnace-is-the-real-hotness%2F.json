Hes been decapping ICs, growing oxide on silicon substrates, and has built a tube furnace capable of reaching 1200 \u00b0C.\nWhat would you do with something that can melt cast iron? We arent sure, but maybe youll tell us in the comments. We do have a fair idea of what [theglassman] is doing, though.\nThe core of the oven is a quartz tube. Insulation is via refractory cement and alumina ceramic wool.\u00a0The heating itself is classic Nichrome wire and a tiny thermocouple. The real key, though, is to the proper controller. [theglassman] suggests a ramp/soak controller. These allow you to program sequences that heat up and then stop, which, if done properly, can prevent your fragile quartz tube from cracking.\n\nNaturally, you need the tube furnace to grow oxides on silicon. It is less clear why hes decapping ICs. We were nervous about his process of boiling down sulfuric acid (fuming nitrate works better, anyway, if you just want to remove the epoxy).\u00a0 If you want to remove everything like he does, sodium hydroxide will also work well.\nObviously, we need to keep an eye on [theglassman]. We are curious what hes working towards. Maybe making a custom transistor? Or, dare we hope, a homemade IC?", "title": "\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9ad8\u6e29\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u7089\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "[theglassman]\u306f\u9ad8\u6e29\u7089\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u95a2\u9023\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u9ad8\u6e29\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u7089\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u8b0e\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bb6\u3001IC\u306e\u30c7\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u57fa\u677f\u3067\u306e\u9178\u5316\u7269\u6210\u9577\u3068\u305d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u9ad8\u6e29\u7089\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u52a0\u71b1\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3078\u306e\u9053\uff1f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6700\u524d\u7dda\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

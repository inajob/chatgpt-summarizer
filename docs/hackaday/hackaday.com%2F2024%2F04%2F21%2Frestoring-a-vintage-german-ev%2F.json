[bleeptrack] shows us through the cockpit of this jet fighter-esque EV and its simple control systems, including a forward and reverse selector and the appreciable kilometers on the odometer.\nModernizing touches for this vehicle include a smart shunt to track the vehicle charge level as an improvement over the wildly unreliable original system and a new DC to DC converter after the original unit failed. These changes really cleaned up the electronics compartment from the original rats nest under the seat.\nThe design of this vehicle has us thinking of the Minimal Motoring Manifesto and how EVs could make cars simpler again.\n\n"}

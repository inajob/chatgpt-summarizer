As always, Supercon is all about you, the Hackaday community. So put on your thinking caps because we\u2019d like to hear your proposals for talks and workshops! The Call for Speakers and Call for Workshops forms are online now, and you\u2019ve got until July 9th to get yourself signed up.\nSupercon is a fantastic event to geek out with your fellow hackers, and to share the inevitable ups and downs that accompany any serious project. Like last year, we\u2019ll be featuring both longer and shorter talks, and hope to get a great mix of both first-time presenters and Hackaday luminaries.\nHonestly, just the crowd that Supercon brings together is reason enough to attend, but then you throw in the talks, the badge-hacking, the food, and the miscellaneous shenanigans \u2026 it\u2019s an event you really don\u2019t want to miss. And as always, presenters get in for free, get their moment in the sun, and get warm vibes from the Hackaday audience. Get yourself signed up now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

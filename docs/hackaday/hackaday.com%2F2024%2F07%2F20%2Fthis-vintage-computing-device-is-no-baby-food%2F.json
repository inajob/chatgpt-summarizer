But in the early days of computing, exotic applications needed custom computers. Whats more is that with the expense of computers, you likely got one made that fit exactly what you needed and no more. That led to many oddball one-off or nearly one-off computers during that time frame. Same for peripheral devices  you built what you had to and you left the rest on the drafting table. [Vintage Geek] got his hands on what appears to be one of them: the Gerber Scientific 6200.\nWhile Gerber Scientific is still around, weve never heard of the 6200. Based on the serial number, we would guess at least 62 of them were made and this one has an interesting backstory of living in someones home who worked at the Pentagon. We presume the tapes were erased before it was sold!\nDesign-wise, it is pretty standard stuff. A 19-inch rack, a standard tape drive from Kennedy, a power supply, and some cards. The box takes 240 V, so the computer didnt get powered up, but an examination of the inside looked like this really was a one-off with handwritten labels on masking tape.\nWe couldnt tell for sure if the device was a computer itself, or just a tape drive and maybe plotter interface for another computer. If you know anything about this device, we are sure [Vintage Geek] would like to hear from you.\nIf this does turn out to have a CPU onboard, wed bet it is bit sliced. If you have a 9-track tape machine, you may have to make your own tapes soon.\n\n"}

The car was able to get up to speed over only 12.3 m (40 ft)! As with many student design team projects, every component was hand built and designed to optimize the power to weight ratio of the vehicle.\nThe students from ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts were excited to regain the record from the team at the University of Stuttgart, having previously held the title in 2014 and 2016. We suspect that they will find any European EV makers engineering department excited for the chance to hire them come graduation.\nIf you want to go fast at a smaller scale, checkout 3D printing RC car wheels for speed, and if youd rather ride the rails at an accelerated rate, heres an article on high speed rail.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

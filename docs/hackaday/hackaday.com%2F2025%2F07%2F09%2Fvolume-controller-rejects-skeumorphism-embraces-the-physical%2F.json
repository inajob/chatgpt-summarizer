[Maker Vibe] decided that this skeuomorphism was so last century, and made himself a\u00a0physical audio control box for his PC.\nSince he has three audio outputs he needs to consider, the peripheral he creates could conceivably be called a fader. It certainly has that look, anyway: each output is controlled by a volume slider  connected to a linear potentiometer  and a mute button. Seeing a linear potentiometer used for volume control threw us for a second, until we remembered this was for the computers volume control, not an actual volume control circuit. The computers volume slider already does the logarithmic conversion. A Seeed Studio Xiao ESP32S3 lives at the heart of this thing, emulating a\u00a0Bluetooth gamepad using a library by LemmingDev. A trio of LEDs round out the electronics to provide an indicator for which audio channels are muted or active.\nThose Bluetooth signals are interpreted by a Python script feeding a software called Voicmeeter Banana, because [Maker Vibe] uses Windows, and Redmonds finest operating system doesnt expose audio controls in an easily-accessible way. Voicmeeter Banana (and its attendant Python script) takes care of telling Windows what to do.\u00a0\nThe whole setup lives on [Maker Vibe]s desk in a handsome 3D printed box. He used a Circuit vinyl cutter to cut out masks so he could airbrush different colours onto the print after sanding down the layer lines. Thats another one for the archive of how to make front panels.\nIf volume sliders arent doing it for you, perhaps youd prefer to control your audio with a conductors baton.\u00a0\n\n", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u98a8\u306e\u7269\u7406\u97f3\u91cf\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u7269\u7406\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002PC\u7528\u306e\u97f3\u91cf\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u98a8\u306e\u7269\u7406\u97f3\u91cf\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- Bluetooth\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308bESP32S3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "- Voicemeeter Banana\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWindows\u3067\u306e\u97f3\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u97f3\u91cf\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u97f3\u91cf\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u6307\u63ee\u68d2\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63d0\u6848"]}

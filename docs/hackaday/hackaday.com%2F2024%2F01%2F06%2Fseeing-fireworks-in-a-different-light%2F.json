[Roman]s goal with this experiment is pretty simple: to see if its possible to cobble together a spectrograph to identify the elements that light up the sky during a pyrotechnic display. The camera rig was mainly assembled from readily available gear, including a Chronos monochrome high-speed camera and a 500-mm telescopic lens. A 100 line/mm grating was attached between the lens and the camera, a finding scope was attached, and the whole thing went onto a sturdy tripod.\nFrom a perch above Prague on New Years Eve, [Roman] collected a ton of images in RAW12 format. The files were converted to TIFFs by a Python script and converted to video by FFmpeg. Frames with good spectra were selected for analysis using a Jupyter Notebook project. Spectra were selected by moving the cursor across the image using slider controls, converting pixel positions into wavelengths.\nThere are some optical improvements [Roman] would like to make, especially in aiming and focusing the camera; as he says, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of fireworks makes them difficult to photograph. As for identifying elements in the spectra, thats on the to-do list until he can find a library of spectra to use. Or, theres always DIY Raman spectroscopy.\n", "title": "DIY\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3067\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u5143\u7d20\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30c9\u30f4\u30a9\u30b8\u30e3\u30af\u3055\u3093\u306f\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u691c\u67fb\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u65b0\u5e74\u3084\u72ec\u7acb\u8a18\u5ff5\u65e5\u304c\u53f0\u7121\u3057\u306b\u306a\u308b\u5fc3\u914d\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u306f\u3001\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u540c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5206\u5149\u5668\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3084\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306a\u3069\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u3001\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3092\u6ce2\u9577\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u540c\u5b9a\u306b\u306f\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u306f\u307e\u3060\u7d9a\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3067\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u5143\u7d20\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3059\u308b", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u671b\u9060\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u64ae\u5f71", "\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u89e3\u6790\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306ePython\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3068Jupyter Notebook\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5143\u7d20\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u82b1\u706b\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6cd5"]}

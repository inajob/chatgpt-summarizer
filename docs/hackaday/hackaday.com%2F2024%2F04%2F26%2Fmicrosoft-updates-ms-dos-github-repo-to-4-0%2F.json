This latest update adds the source code for v4.0 (no binaries this time), which originally hit the market back in 1988. We cant help but notice that DOS v3.0 didnt get invited to the party  perhaps it was decided that it wasnt historically significant enough to include.\nThat said, readers with sufficiently gray beards may recall that DOS 4.0 wasnt particularly well received back in the day. It was the sort of thing where you either stuck with something in the 3.x line if you had older hardware, or waited it out and jumped to the greatly improved v5 when it was released. Modern equivalents would probably be the response to Windows Vista, Windows 8, and maybe even Windows 11. Hey, at least Microsoft keeps some things consistent.\nIts interesting that they would preserve whats arguably the least popular version of MS-DOS in this way, but then again theres something to be said for having a historical record on what not to do for future generations. If youre waiting to take a look at what was under the hood in the final MS-DOS 6.22 release, sit tight. At this rate we should be seeing it sometime in the 2030s."}

You could choose to carefully make a cable bundle out of ten wires and try to squish them to have a thin footprint  or you could put an FFC connector onto your board and save yourself a world of trouble. If you want to have a lot of components within a cramped non-flat area, you could carefully design a multitude of stuff FR4 boards and connect them together  or you could make an FPC.\nFlexible cables in particular can be pretty wonderful for all sorts of moving parts. They transfer power and data to the scanner head in your flat-bed scanner, for instance.\u00a0 But theyre in fixed parts too.\u00a0 If you have a laptop or a widescreen TV, chances are, theres an flexible cable connecting the motherboard with one or multiple daughterboards  or even a custom-made flexible PCB. Remember all the cool keypad and phones we used to have, the ones that would have the keyboard fold out or slide out, or even folding Nokia phones that had two screens and did cool things with those? All thanks to flexible circuits! Lets learn a little more about what were working with here.\nFFC and FPC, how are these two different? FFC (Flexible Flat Cable) is a pre-made cable. Youve typically seen them as white plastic cables with blue pieces on both ends, theyre found in a large number of devices that you could disassemble, and many things use them, like the Raspberry Pi Camera. They are pretty simple to produce  all in all, theyre just flat straight conductors packaged nicely into a very thin cable, and thats why you can buy them pre-made in tons of different pin pitches and sizes. If you need one board to interface with another board, putting an FFC connector on your board is a pretty good idea.\n\nAn FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) is a custom flexible PCB, usually of dark orange colour, same colour as kapton tape. These are fundamentally always a custom design  you can pay to have someone produce your FPC design, just like you would have any PCB produced. You could say that an FPC is really just a PCB thats very thin and bendy  which makes them wonderful for all sorts of purposes! You can make FPCs for building wearables, medical technology, PCB patches, and you can produce FPCs that act as FFC interconnects if you want better signal integrity, too!\n\n\n\n\nSome people use these two terms interchangeably, but its good to know the difference in case youre getting confusing search results. Lets go through what it takes to hack on both of these, starting with FFCs and FFC connectors!\nCables Galore\nYou can find FFCs in many different places! If youve ever disassembled a CD/DVD drive, a laptop, a robot vacuum, or a piece of semi-industrial machinery, theyre there, and of course, youll know about them if youve ever handled a Raspberry Pi camera. You can also buy FFCs in many lengths on the usual marketplaces  even eBay and Aliexpress carry some, theres a rich assortment at LCSC, and Mouser with Digikey are bound to carry a few. LCSCs offerings have been the best bang for the buck in my experience, for both cables and connectors, and the usual retailers are pretty okay for one-off FFC purchases. Generally, FFC lengths are somewhat standardized, and tend to come in 5 cm or 10 cm increments. If you want a very specific 12.5 mm FPC in your build, I wouldnt hold your breath, so maybe plan for some slack.\nFive different pitches  1.27mm, 1mm, 0.8mm, 0.5mm and 0.35mm with staggered rows.\nTheres four common pin pitches for FFCs  1 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.35 mm. 1.27 mm FFCs exist but are pretty rare. The larger FFCs have straight contacts as youve commonly seen them, and 0.35 mm pitch FFCs have the exposed pins staggered at the connector ends. In fact, 0.35 mm FFCs are most likely to be flex PCBs built for FFC purpose, dark orange instead of white, because the contact staggering seems to require an FPC process to manufacture and cant quite be done with regular FFC flattened piece of straight wire production tech. Still, 0.35 mm is a valid pitch when youre on the lookout for FFC connectors. FFCs start from four pins  Ive never seen a two-pin or three-pin FFC, and they appear to be a rarity on marketplaces too.\nBeyond pitch and length, theres a third defining parameter for FFCs, which is orientation. Theres two kinds of orientation  straight, where the exposed pins on both ends are on the same planar side of the FFC, and reverse, where the exposed pins are on different planar sides. This is something to look out for  if you use a straight FFC in a place where a reverse FFC goes or vice-versa, you might end up with either no connection or reverse pinout connection. (And no connection is obviously the preferable option here.)\nIf youre not interfacing with an already existing FFC, which pitch do you choose? My advice is, pick whichever is the most comfortable for you to solder that still fits in the space you have. Manufacturers seem to stick with 0.5 mm in integrated devices and 1 mm in general devices, with 0.8 mm rarely being used. I stick with 0.5 mm in my more integrated devices, with the caveat that I try and get the connectors to reflow into place with a stencil and solder paste, because hand-soldering 0.5 mm connectors is trickier than 1 mm ones. 1 mm FFC connectors are pretty easy to handsolder, on the other hand!\nConnectors All Around\nYoull find all sorts of connectors for FFCs  horizontal, vertical, SMD, and even through-hole connectors for 1 mm FFCs specifically. That is more of an exception  FFC connectors tend to be SMD as a rule. Heres a sneaky parameter  horizontal FFC connectors can be bottom vs top vs either side contact connectors. This defines which side the connector expects the exposed pins to be on, relative to the board surface  bottom is same side as the PCB surface, top is opposite of the PCB surface, and either side will make contact no matter which side the FFC has exposed pins on. This largely determines whether you need a straight or reverse FFC. If youve accidentally picked a straight FFC where youd need a reverse FFC, swapping a bottom-contact FFC connector for a top-contact one will save you the embarrassment. Vertical connectors also have this alignment  for instance, the Raspberry Pi vertical FFC connectors do.\nWill your FFC fit into a connector? The main question youd think about would be thickness. However, thickness on both ends is fairly standardized  a typical FFC with blue stiffener strips on each end is 0.3 mm thickness total, so as long as the connector you pick claims to be compatible with 0.3 mm FFCs, and most are, it will fit a generic FFC with blue strips on its ends. Without that stiffener strip, expect 0.1 mm thickness  but its rare that youll find an FFC without stiffener. Its always okay to superglue a piece of stiffener from another FFC in a pinch if it breaks off!\nA bigger question is the overall FFC width, and whether it has ears  for same pitch and pin count, some FFCs are wider than others! Ive got bitten by this with a Framework keyboard reuse adapter  both the keyboard and the fingerprint sensor FFCs have extra width on the sides. At least on laptop keyboards, some FFCs even have ears meant to mate with the connector, to make sure that the FFC stays in the connector extra securely. If you have to work with such an FFC, youll do good paying extra attention to FFC connector datasheets before you click on the Buy button and solder them onto your PCB!\nThese are the criteria you need to keep in mind when picking FFC connectors for your board, especially if youre working with already existing cables. Now, lets talk about the less obvious aspects of FFCs, that you still should know before working with them.\nHandling Instructions\nIf you want an FFC footprint but Kicad doesnt have a suitable one in the library, that is actually not a problem at all  Kicad has an FFC connector generator! In the footprint editor, use the Footprint Wizard button (top left corner), which lets you make any FFC footprint with any number and pitch of pins that you could need! On the schematic side, you should use the MountingPin generic connector symbols, and change the autogenerated KiCad footprint pads from `0` to `MP`. I recommend grounding shield pads for the extra mechanical stability alone  it provides no electrical connection whatsoever, of course, so you can do whatever with them safely, but grounding them seems to be a way better choice all around. On cramped boards, grounding the pads also means you dont impede ground propagation with a huge unconnected pad.\nRemember to rename the side pads from 0 to MP!\nYou can bend FFCs, and thats why we love them. Of course, theres the usual have it snake within your enclosure with a pretty liberal bend radius  an FFC that constantly snakes around like that, will break eventually, but it will live quite a bit until that happens, and you can see that in scanners, FFCs arent a failure point we know about.\nYou can even fold the FFC onto itself if you are careful and dont redo the bend. Usually, folds like this are done diagonally for 90 degree turn purposes. You can even bend an FFC diagonally twice if you need to make a 180 degree turn, or if you need to do an X/Y axis distance change! Of course, keep in mind that sharply bending and unbending an FFC will inevitably break the wires inside of it. If you want to check for broken wires inside an FFC, you can place it in front of a flashlight or a strong desk light  the light will shine through any cracks in the metal.\nYou can also solder FFCs to boards in a pinch  however, unless you use low-temp solder, that gets messy fast. Soldering to an FFC with a white plastic covering will quickly melt the plastic  not a problem with FPC-produced FFC with orange kapton backing, but again, those are rare. Also, if you are about to hot air your board, you want to watch out for FFC connectors. They might be a bit more heat-resistant than regular plastic, but that resistance is mostly for short duration IR oven reflow circumstances  they are still, fundamentally, plastic! Cover them with kapton or metal foil or both if youre about to heatgun your board, just like youd cover any plastic part, because replacing FFC connectors can be a hassle if you accidentally melt one, and would likely be required.\nLast but not least, even if youre not adding any extra FFC sauce to anything, you still have things to mind. When latching and un-latching an FFC connector, take care  dont do it from one side at a time, do it at the center or from both sides at once. Breaking off a latch is quite annoying because then you must replace it or bodge it, and theyre finicky to replace, if you even have a spare connector to get a replacement latch from. Same goes for FFC  if you arent careful while inserting an FFC into its connector, you can have individual pins dislodge from the FFC plastic and bend away, this is especially easy to cause if youre working with 0.5 mm FFCs. When the pin bends away, the best case is that it breaks away and disappears somewhere, the worst case is that it bends onto other pins and creates a short-circuit.\nOn the FFC account, this is what you need to know. Next time, lets look into FPCs, flexible boards of the printed variety  see where theyre useful, requirements for designing one, and even try to design one ourselves!\nFeatured image Plextor PX-716A  disc drive motor with Sony Chemicals flexible flat cable by [Raimond Spekking]"}

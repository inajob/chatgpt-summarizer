But theyre not the only option. [Oliver Schmidt] has been exploring how the Raspberry Pi Pico can serve in such a role for the classic Apple II. The talk was presented at the KansasFest event this year, and its well worth diving into!\n[Oliver] has developed A2Pico. Its a series of Apple II peripheral cards that are based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, as you might have guessed. [Oliver] has been working in the area since 2021 with one [Glenn Jones], with the duo experimenting with connecting the versatile microcontroller directly to the slot bus of the Apple II. [Ralle Palaveev] then chimed in, developing the A2Pico hardware with solely through-hole components for ease of assembly.\nA number of cards have been developed based on A2Pico, including a storage device, a Z80 CP/M card, and a specialized card to play Bad Apple on the IIGS. Its all thanks to the versatility of the programmable I/O (PIO) peripheral inside the Raspberry Pi Pico. This device enables the Pico to be reprogrammed to handle all sorts of complicated tasks at great speed. This is particularly useful when using it to bit-bang a protocol or talk with another machine, and it serves perfectly well in this role. Basically, by reprogramming the Pico and its PIO, the A2Pico design can become any one of a number of different add-on cards.\nIts well worth diving into this stuff if youve ever contemplated building your own peripheral cards for 8-bit and 16-bit machines. Weve seen some other great add-on cards for vintage machines before, too.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fApple II\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u62e1\u5f35\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300cA2Pico\u300d\u958b\u767a", "body": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fApple II\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30baA2Pico\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u30018\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u308416\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6a5f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u5468\u8fba\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3059\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u81e8\u5834\u611f\u3042\u3075\u308c\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fApple II\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u62e1\u5f35\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300cA2Pico\u300d\u958b\u767a", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fApple II\u5411\u3051\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aA2Pico", "Apple II\u7528\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300cA2Pico\u300d\uff1aRaspberry Pi Pico\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fApple II\u5411\u3051\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfApple II\u5411\u3051\u306eRaspberry Pi Pico\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u958b\u767a"]}

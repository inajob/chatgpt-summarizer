[Boothy Builds] recently found himself in this situation, so he designed the Hi5, a printer that holds its hotend between two cantilevered arms.The hotend uses bearings to slide along the metal arms, which themselves run along linear rails. The most difficult part of the design was creating the coupling between the guides that slides along the arms. It had to be rigid enough to position the hotend accurately and repeatably, but also flexible enough avoid binding. The current design uses springs to tension the bearings, though [Boothy Builds] eventually intends to find a more elegant solution. Three independent rails support the print bed, which lets the printer make small alterations to the bed\u2019s tilt, automatically tramming it. Earlier iterations used CNC-milled bed supports, but [Boothy Builds] found that 3D printed plastic supports did a better job of damping out vibrations.[Boothy Builds] notes that the current design puts the X and Y belts under considerable load, which sometimes causes them to slip, leading to occasional layer shifts and noise in the print. He acknowledges that the design still has room for improvement, but the design seems quite promising to us.This printer\u2019s use of cantilevered arms to support the print head puts it in good company with another interesting printer we\u2019ve seen. Of course, that design element does also lend itself to the very cheapest of printers.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip!", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHi5\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcHi5\u306f\u3001\u30ab\u30f3\u30c1\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u652f\u3048\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHi5\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306a\u71b1\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b", "- \u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u5370\u5237\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u8ca0\u8377\u554f\u984c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

Memory had to be monitored closely, clock cycles taken into account, and even video outputs had to be careful not to overwhelm the processor. This can seem foreign in the modern world where double-digit gigabytes of memory is not only common, its expected, but if you want to hone your programming skills theres no better way to do it than with the limitations imposed by something like a retro computer or a Raspberry Pi Pico.\nThis project is called Kaleidoscopio, built by [Linus \u00c5kesson] aka [lft] and goes deep into the hardware of the Pi Pico in order to squeeze as much out of the small, inexpensive platform as possible. The demo is written with 17,000 lines of assembly using the RISC-V instruction set. The microcontroller has two cores on it, with one core acting as the computers chipset and the other acts as the CPU, rendering the effects. The platform has no dedicated audio or video components, so everything here is done in software using this setup to act as a PC from the 80s might. In this case, [lft] is taking inspiration from the Amiga platform, his favorite of that era.\nThe only hardware involved in this project apart from the Pi Pico itself are a few resistors, an audio jack, and a VGA port, further demonstrating that the software is the workhorse in this build. Its impressive not only for wringing out as much as possible from the platform but for using the arguably weaker RISC-V cores instead of the ARM cores, as the Pi Pico includes both. [lft] goes into every detail on the projects page as well, for those who are still captivated by the era of computer programming where every bit mattered. For more computing demos like this, take a look at this one which is based on [lft]s retrocomputer of choice, the Amiga.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1aKaleidoscopio\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Kaleidoscopio\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001Pi Pico\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u300117,000\u884c\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3067\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1aKaleidoscopio\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408", "RISC-V\u547d\u4ee4\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306ePC\u98a8\u306e\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01Pi Pico\u3067\u306e\u5275\u9020\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580"]}

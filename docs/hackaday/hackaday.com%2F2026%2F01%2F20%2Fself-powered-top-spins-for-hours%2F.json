Any other top, that is, except for [Aaed Musa]\u2019s self-spinning top, which can continuously spin for about two hours before coming to a stop.\nThe one constraint was that every functional component had to be contained within the top\u2019s shell, and [Aaed]\u2019s first approach was to build a reaction wheel into the top. When a motor accelerates a weighted wheel, conservation of angular momentum applies an equal and opposite torque to the motor. The problem is that motors eventually reach a top speed and stop accelerating, which puts an end to the torque. This is known as saturation, and the only way to desaturate a reaction wheel is to slow it down, which counteracts the originally generated torque. [Aaed] originally planned to mount the motor in a one-way bearing, which would let it bleed off speed without producing torque against the rest of the top, but it was rather choppy in practice.\nThe solution occurred to [Aaed] while watching the aforementioned final scene, when it occurred to him that the wobbling of a top could actually generate rotation. A prototype proved that an off-center weight rotating at a constant speed did successfully spin the top by rotating the center of mass, and after that, it was a matter of incremental testing and improvement. A higher moment of inertia worked better, as did a lower center of gravity and a tip made from a hard, low-friction silicon nitride ball bearing. He made housings out of both 3D-printed plastic and CNC-milled aluminium, which each contained a tiny brushless motor, an electric speed controller, a microcontroller, and a small rechargeable lithium battery.\nIf you allow for external power, you can make the top itself the rotor of a motor, and drive it from a base. Alternatively, if you levitate your top in a vacuum, it could spin for longer than recorded history.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u3089\u56de\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u81ea\u3089\u56de\u308b\u30b3\u30de\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fAaed Musa\u306f\u3001\u56de\u8ee2\u306e\u539f\u7406\u3092\u5fdc\u7528\u3057\u30012\u6642\u9593\u56de\u8ee2\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u3089\u56de\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u56de\u8ee2\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\uff1a\u81ea\u5df1\u56de\u8ee2\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u4fdd\u5b58\u3068\u53cd\u5fdc\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068CNC\u52a0\u5de5\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7", "\u771f\u7a7a\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306e\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u56de\u8ee2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

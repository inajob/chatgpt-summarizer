Creator [Ian Lesnet] and several members of the community are constantly working to add new features and capabilities to the hardware hacking multi-tool, to the point that if your firmware is more than a few days old theres an excellent chance theres a fresher build available for you to try out.\nOne of the biggest additions from the last week or so of development has been the I2C sniffer  a valuable tool for troubleshooting or reverse engineering devices using the popular communications protocol. [Ian] has posted a brief demo video of it in action.\n\nIts actually a capability that was available in the classic versions of the Bus Pirate, but rather than porting the feature over from the old firmware, [Ian] decided to fold the MIT licensed pico_i2c_sniffer from [Juan Schiavoni] into the new codebase. Thanks to the RP2040s PIO, the sniffer works at up to 500 kHz, significantly outperforming its predecessor.\nAdmittedly, I2C sniffing isnt anything you couldnt do with a cheap logic analyzer. But that means dealing with captures and making sure the protocol decoder is setup properly, among other bits of software tedium. In comparison, once you start the sniffer program on the Bus Pirate 5, I2C data will be dumped out to the terminal in real-time for as long as you care to see it. For reverse engineering, its also very easy to move quickly from sniffing I2C packets to replaying or modifying them within the Bus Pirates interface.\nIf you already have a Bus Pirate 5, all you need to do is flash the latest firmware from the automated build system, and get sniffing. On the fence about picking one up? Perhaps our hands-on review will help change your mind."}

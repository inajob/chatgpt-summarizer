For decades, though, keyboards were mostly wired, which can limit where you use your favorite one. To address this, [KoStard]\u2019s latest project uses an ESP32 to bridge a USB keyboard to BLE devices.\nThe ESP32-S3 packs a ton of fantastic functionality into its small size and low price\u2014including USB-OTG support, which is key here. Taking advantage of this, [KoStard] programmed an ESP32-S3 to host a keyboard over its USB port while connecting via BLE to devices like cellphones.\nThere are some slick tricks baked in, too: you can pair with up to three devices and switch between them using a key combo. Some of you might be wondering how you can just plug a microcontroller into a keyboard and have it work. The truth is, it doesn\u2019t without extra hardware. Both the keyboard and ESP32-S3 need power. The simplest fix is a powered USB hub: it can be battery-powered for a truly mobile setup, or use a wired 5V supply so you never have to charge batteries.\nWe love seeing a simple, affordable microcontroller extend the usefulness of gear you already have. Let us know in the comments about other hacks you\u2019ve used to connect keyboards to devices never designed for them.\n\n"}

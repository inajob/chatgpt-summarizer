For decades, though, keyboards were mostly wired, which can limit where you use your favorite one. To address this, [KoStard]\u2019s latest project uses an ESP32 to bridge a USB keyboard to BLE devices.\nThe ESP32-S3 packs a ton of fantastic functionality into its small size and low price\u2014including USB-OTG support, which is key here. Taking advantage of this, [KoStard] programmed an ESP32-S3 to host a keyboard over its USB port while connecting via BLE to devices like cellphones.\nThere are some slick tricks baked in, too: you can pair with up to three devices and switch between them using a key combo. Some of you might be wondering how you can just plug a microcontroller into a keyboard and have it work. The truth is, it doesn\u2019t without extra hardware. Both the keyboard and ESP32-S3 need power. The simplest fix is a powered USB hub: it can be battery-powered for a truly mobile setup, or use a wired 5V supply so you never have to charge batteries.\nWe love seeing a simple, affordable microcontroller extend the usefulness of gear you already have. Let us know in the comments about other hacks you\u2019ve used to connect keyboards to devices never designed for them.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32\u3067USB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092BLE\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066USB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092BLE\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3067USB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092BLE\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308bESP32\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u3067\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u306aUSB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u8907\u6570\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308bESP32-S3\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u63a5\u7d9a\u6280\u8853", "- \u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

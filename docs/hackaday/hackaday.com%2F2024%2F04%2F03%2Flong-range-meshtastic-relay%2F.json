These radio modules are largely exempt from licensing requirements due to their low power and typically only operate within a very small area. But by borrowing some ideas from the licensed side of amateur radio, [Peter Fairlie] built this Meshtastic repeater which can greatly extend the range of his low-power system.\n[Peter] is calling this a long lines relay after old ATT microwave technology, but it is essentially two Heltec modules set up to operate as Meshtastic nodes, where one can operate as a receiver while the other re-transmits the received signal. Each is connected to a log-periodic antenna to greatly increase the range of the repeater along the direction of the antenna. These antennas are highly directional, but they allow [Peter] to connect to Meshtastic networks in the semi-distant city of Toronto which he otherwise wouldnt be able to hear.\nWith the two modules connected to the antennas and enclosed in a weatherproof box, the system was mounted on a radio tower allowing a greatly increased range for these low-power devices. If youre familiar with LoRa but not Meshtastic, its become somewhat popular lately for being a straightforward tool for setting up low-power networks for various tasks. [Jonathan Bennett] explored it in much more detail as an emergency communications mode after a tornado hit his home town.\n\n", "title": "\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eMeshtastic\u4e2d\u7d99\u5c40\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u501f\u308a\u3066Meshtastic\u4e2d\u7d99\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u30022\u3064\u306eHeltec\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u53d7\u4fe1\u5074\u3068\u518d\u9001\u4fe1\u5074\u3068\u3057\u3066\u904b\u7528\u3002\u30ed\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u901a\u4fe1\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u62e1\u5927\u3002", "titles": ["\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eMeshtastic\u4e2d\u7d99\u5c40\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "Heltec\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMeshtastic\u4e2d\u7d99\u5c40\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2\u4e2d\u7d99\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bMeshtastic\u4e2d\u7d99\u5c40\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eHeltec\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb", "Meshtastic\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3078\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u62e1\u5927\u3059\u308b\u5929\u5019\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u4e2d\u7d99\u5c40"]}

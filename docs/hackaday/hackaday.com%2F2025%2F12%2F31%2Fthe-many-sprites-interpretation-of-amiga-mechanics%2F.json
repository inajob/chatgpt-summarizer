As a result, hardware design was specifically built to manipulate sprites, and generally as new generations of hardware were produced the number of sprites a system could produce went up. But [Coding Secrets], who published games for the Commodore Amiga, used an interesting method to get this system to produce far more sprites at a single time than the hardware claimed to support.\nThis hack is demonstrated with [Coding Secrets]s first published game on the Amiga,\u00a0Leander. Normally the Amiga can only display up to eight sprites at once, but there is a coprocessor in the computer that allows for re-drawing sprites in different areas of the screen. It can wait for certain vertical and horizontal line positions and then execute certain instructions. This doesnt allow unlimited sprites to be displayed, but as long as only eight are displayed on any given line the effect is similar. [Coding Secrets] used this trick to display the information bar with sprites, as well as many backgrounds, all simultaneously with the characters and enemies wed normally recognize as sprites.\nOf course, using built-in hardware to do something the computer was designed to do isnt necessarily a hack, but it does demonstrate how intimate knowledge of the system could result in a much more in-depth and immersive experience even on hardware that was otherwise limited. It also wasnt free to use this coprocessor; it stole processing time away from other tasks the game might otherwise have to perform, so it did take finesse as well. Weve seen similar programming feats in other gaming projects like this one which gets Tetris running with only 1000 lines of code.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith] for the tip!", "title": "- \u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u767a\u660e\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u767a\u660e\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30fc\u30af\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306fAmiga\u306e\u5236\u9650\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u767a\u660e\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u6570\u3092\u5287\u7684\u306b\u5897\u3084\u3059\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30fc\u30af\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u300d\u306b\u898b\u308b\u6280\u8853\u9769\u65b0", "- \u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u8868\u793a\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u751f\u3080\u6ca1\u5165\u611f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13"]}

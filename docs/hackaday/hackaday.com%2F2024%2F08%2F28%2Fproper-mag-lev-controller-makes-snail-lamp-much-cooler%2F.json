It has, however, proven useful to [mrdiytechmagic], who has put the technology to grand use in making his levitating snail lamp.\n\nThe build is actually relatively complicated compared to some levitating toys you might have seen before. It uses a number of coils to produce a magnetic field to levitate the 3D printed plastic snail which contains the lighting element itself.\nThe actively controlled levitation base uses a magnetic sensor to detect the changing field as the snail moves above it. It then varies the current going to the various coils to keep the snail balanced and in place. Power is transmitted with a further larger coil, much as in a wireless phone charger. This is picked up by a circuit in the snail, and used to power the LEDs inside.\nIt might not have been our first choice, but having seen it in action, we cant deny a levitating 3D printed snail is pretty impressive. If youd prefer something slightly more befitting such a high-tech looking presentation, perhaps a hovering SpaceX Starship would be more your speed.\n\n\n"}

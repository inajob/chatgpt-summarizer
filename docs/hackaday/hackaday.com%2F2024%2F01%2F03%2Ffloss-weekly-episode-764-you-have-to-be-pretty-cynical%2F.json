Whats the difference between those projects, and why does it matter?\nProjects need more than just developers. How do you keep members doing documentation, bug hunting, outreach, and even graphic design plugged in and feeling like part of the team? How do you walk the narrow line between the different directions a project can drift, setting up your community for long term success? And wheres the most surprising place benny has found AlmaLinux running? And why is bennys first name never capitalized? Give this weeks show a listen to find out!\n\nInformation on AlmaLinux can be found on the website, where you can discover the ELevate migration tool, download images, and more.\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord? Next week were interviewing Randal Schwartz on Tuesday instead of Wednesday, so synchronize your timepieces!\n\nPlaces to follow the FLOSS Weekly Podcast:\n\n\n\t<!--  Google Podcasts  -->\n\t<!-- iTunes  -->\n\tSpotify\n\t<!--  Stitcher  -->\n\tRSS\n\t\t<!-- YouTube  -->\n\nDirect Download in DRM-free MP3."}

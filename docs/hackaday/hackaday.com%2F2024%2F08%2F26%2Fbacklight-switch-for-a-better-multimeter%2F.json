His solution? He added a manual toggle switch to control the backlight, allowing it to stay on as long as needed. He began by disassembling the multimeter\u2014removing the outer bumper and a few screws\u2014to access the backlight, labeled BL. He identified the voltage regulator outputting 2.8V, desoldered the red wire, and extended it to install the switch.\nOn his first try, he successfully drilled a spot for the SPST switch. To fit the switch into the multimeters rubber bumper, he used a circular punch, although his second hole wasn\u2019t as clean as the first. Despite this minor setback, the modification worked perfectly, giving him complete control over his multimeters backlight without the original 15-second timeout.\n\nThis project follows a tradition of inventive multimeter hacks. Other enthusiasts have made similar upgrades. An older hack involves adding an external display to a multimeter. More recently, we wrote about upgrading your probes. Notably,\u00a0adding Bluetooth for data communication showed how diverse and creative these modifications can be."}

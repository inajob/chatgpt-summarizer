Back in the 1950s, a curious and crafty group of enthusiasts invented their own global social network: on reels of magnetic tape. They called it tapesponding (short for tape corresponding), and it was a booming hobby for thousands of radio hams, tinkerers, and audio geeks. Heres the original video on this analog marvel.\nThese folks werent just swapping mixtapes. They crafted personal audio letters, beamed across the globe on 3-inch reels. DIY clubs emerged everywhere: World Tape Pals (Texas-based, naturally) clocked 5,000 members from every Free Nation  which frames it in a world in terms of East vs. West. Some groups even pooled funds to buy shared tape decks in poorer regions  pure hacker spirit. The tech behind it: Speeds of 3\u00be IPS, half-track mono, round-robin reels, and rigorous trust networks to avoid ghosters. Honestly, it makes IRC net ops look soft. Tapesponding wasnt just for chatty types. It fostered deep friendships, even marriages. It was social engineering before that term was coined. The video is below the break.\nWhat are your thoughts on this nostalgic way of long-distance communication? The warm whirring of a spinning tape reel? The waiting time before your echo is returned? Or are have you skipped all the analog mechanics and shouted out into the LoRaWAN void long ago?\n\n", "title": "- \u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u7e4b\u304c\u308b\uff011950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0SNS\u300c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d", "body": "1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001\u78c1\u6c17\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u300c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u304c\u6d41\u884c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u7e4b\u304c\u308b\uff011950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0SNS\u300c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u30ec\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7bc9\u3044\u305f\u53cb\u60c5\u3068\u611b\u60c5\uff1aDIY\u30af\u30e9\u30d6\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- \u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u4ea4\u6d41\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u56fd\u5883\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u7d46", "- 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6280\u8853", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u8003\u5bdf"]}

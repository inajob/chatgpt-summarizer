Being jerks, at least in our experience. But like many hackers, [Brent] wanted to quantify the activity of his cat, and this instrumented cat exercise wheel was the result.\nTo pull this off, [Brent] used what he had on hand, which was an M5Stack ESP32 module, a magnetic reed switch, and of course, the cat exercise wheel [Luna] seemed to be in the habit of using at about 4:00 AM daily. The wheel was adorned with a couple of neodymium magnets to trip the reed switch twice per revolution, with the pulse stream measured on one of the GPIOs. The code does a little debouncing of the switch and calculates the cats time and distance stats, uploading the data to OpenSearch for analysis and visualization. [Brent] kindly includes the code and the OpenSearch setup in case you want to duplicate this project.\nAs for results, theyre pretty consistent with what weve seen with similar cat-tracking efforts. A histogram of [Luna]s activity shows that she does indeed hop on the wheel at oh-dark-thirty every day, no doubt in an effort to assassinate [Brent] via sleep deprivation. Theres also another burst of zoomies around 6:00 PM. But the rest of the day? Pretty much sleeping.", "title": "\u300c\u732b\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u904b\u52d5\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "body": "\u732b\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u904b\u52d5\u5668\u5177\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u5206\u6790\u7528\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3002\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306b\u732b\u306f\u5bdd\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u732b\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u904b\u52d5\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "\u300cM5Stack ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u732b\u306e\u904b\u52d5\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u732b\u7528\u904b\u52d5\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u898b\u3048\u305f\u7761\u7720\u6642\u9593\u300d", "\u300c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u732b\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u306e\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u732b\u306e\u591c\u4e2d\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d"]}

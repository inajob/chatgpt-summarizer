When a transmitter is in VOX mode, it starts transmitting when you talk, and then, when you pause for a second or two, the transmitter turns off. Many old ham transmitters, though, didnt support VOX, so Heathkit sold the VX-1 electronic voice control to add VOX to older transmitters. [Jeff Tranter] shows us inside a clean-looking unit.\nThese devices were sold from 1958 to 1960 and used tubes and a selenium rectifier. The device is connected between the microphone and the transmitter. It also sat between the receiver and the speaker to mute audio while transmitting. The original unit had a screw terminal to connect to the outside world, and some of the screws had live line voltage on them. The unit [Jeff] examines is modified to have phono jacks along with a few other repairs.\nThe wiring looks like a tube radio. Tubes are above the chassis, and point-to-point wiring is underneath. There is also an unusual sealed selenium rectifier. [Jeff] shows how the device works using just a receiver. A few minor repairs were needed.\nIf you are interested in getting your ham license, most modern radios support VOX out of the box  no rhyme intended. We do, however, love that old Heathkit gear.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bVOX\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306b\u306f\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\uff08VOX\uff09\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3042\u307e\u308a\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u3044\u306a\u3044\u30021958\u5e74\u304b\u30891960\u5e74\u306b\u304b\u3051\u3066\u8ca9\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305fVOX\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308bHeathkit\u306eVX-1\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u58f0\u5236\u5fa1\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7279\u306b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002[wake]\u306f\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bVOX\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "Heathkit\u306eVX-1\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u58f0\u5236\u5fa1\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u898b\u308b", "\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306bVOX\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305fHeathkit\u306eVX-1\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u58f0\u5236\u5fa1\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f1958\u5e74\u304b\u30891960\u5e74\u306eVOX\u8ffd\u52a0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

We find that hard to believe given the number of tongues that [Attoparsec] was able to translate into embossing plastic. Thats right, this project is about making custom font wheels for an embosser, formerly known as a label maker.\nIf you think this seems like a finicky and perhaps lengthy mission to undertake, youre right. In case youre unfamiliar, ye olde embosser uses both a positive and a negative of each glyph in order to impress the sticky-backed plastic strip. It all started when [Attoparsec] found out about the Dymo 1595, which comes with font wheels for both Japanese hiragana and katakana in addition to English.\nAfter sacrificing the English wheel, it was time to model the wheel part itself. That was easy enough, but the characters themselves were another story. Because of how the thing works, the negative has to be bigger than the positive to provide enough room for the tape. After trying to achieve the right draft angle on the characters in several CAD packages, [Attoparsec] was told that it should be fairly easy in OpenSCAD, and it was.\nPrinting in resin took about five hours to do both wheels at once. Once [Attoparsec] had the workflow down, they were off to the races. In this video alone, they made Old English, Esperanto, the International Phonetic Alphabet, an alphabet created by playwright George Bernard Shaw, Palm Pilot input script, and of course, Tolkeins Tengwar. Be sure to check out the video after the break.\nTired of turning the wheel of your embosser to make labels? Automate the process with a stepper motor or two.\n\n\nThanks to [smellsofbikes] and [Jonas] for the tip!"}

Here specifically, the focus is on substituting vision into hand sensations, aimed at blind and vision disabled. The prototype is quite inspiration-worthy!\nOn the input side, we have a wrist-mounted camera, sprinkled with a healthy amount of image processing, of course. As for the output, no vibromotors or actuators are in use  instead, tactile receptors are stimulated by passing small amounts of current through your skin, triggering your touch receptors electrically. An 88 array of such tactile pixels is placed on the back of the hand and fingers. The examples provided show it to be a decent substitution.\nThis technique depends on the type of image processing being used, as well as the resolution of the pixels, but its a fun concept nevertheless, and the study preprint has some great stories to tell. This ones far from the first sensory substitution devices weve covered, though, as quite a few of them were mechanical in nature  the less moving parts, the better, we reckon!"}

Cheap (especially if you count the clones), easy to find, and quick to deploy, with countless support libraries, its a go-to for many a hack. This scribe simply cant remember how many hes bought, hacked, and deployed over the years. But can it be improved? [John Loeffler] thinks so, and his 2023 Hackaday Prize entry, the Uno Plus+ could be the one.\nIf this is too much bling for you, there is a version with LEDs adjacent to non-illuminated headers.\nAfter clearing the top deck of extraneous components (by shoving them on the bottom) there was much more space to expand the header labeling, so there can be no accidental misplacement of those DuPont wires this thing will inevitably sprout randomly.\nThe board also has an additional Stemma/Qwiic connector and a Neopixel LED for indication duties. Also sitting on the PCB bottom are a ton of opamps, to drive the header indicators. Yes, this board has a full set of colour-coded LED bling indicators, showing the logical state of each and every pin on all headers, giving an easy way to check the desired activity is occurring. Plus it looks cool. Illuminated headers? YES!\nThink the Uno too light on resources to perform any meaningful modern workloads? Think again!\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3092\u65bd\u3057\u3066\u3088\u308a\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\uff01", "body": "Arduino Uno\u306f\u3001\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304b\u3089\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6539\u826f\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3002\u305d\u306e\u6539\u826f\u6848\u3067\u3042\u308bUno Plus+\u306f\u3001\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u8272\u5225\u3067\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308bLED\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u30d8\u30c3\u30c0\u306e\u30e9\u30d9\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3082\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u591a\u304f\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u51e6\u7406\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u306b\u6539\u826f\u3092\u65bd\u3057\u3066\u3088\u308a\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\uff01", "\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u62e1\u5927\u3057\u305f\u300cUno Plus+\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u62e1\u5f35\u7248\u300cUno Plus+\u300d\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u306bLED\u304c\u4ed8\u304d\u3001\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u305f\u300cUno Plus+\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ceUno\u300d\u3092\u9032\u5316\u3055\u305b\u305f\u300cUno Plus+\u300d\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u306e\u7684\u306b\uff01"]}

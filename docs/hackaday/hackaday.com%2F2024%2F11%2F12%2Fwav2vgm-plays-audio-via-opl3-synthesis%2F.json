It took too much RAM and too many CPU cycles and it was just altogether too difficult. Instead, they relied upon synthesizing audio from basic instructions to make sounds and music. [caiannello] has taken advantage of this with the WAV2VGM project.\nThe basic concept is straightforward enough\u2014you put a WAV audio file into the tool, and it spits out synthesis instructions for the classic OPL3 sound card. The Python script only works with 16-bit mono WAV files with a 44,100 Hz sample rate.\nAmazingly, check the samples, and youll find the output is pretty recognizable. You can take a song with lyrics (like Still Alive from\u00a0Portal),\u00a0turn it into instructions for an OPL3, and its pretty intelligible. It sounds glitchy and damaged, but its absolutely understandable.\nIts a fun little retro project that, admittedly, doesnt have a lot of real applications. Still, if youre making a Portal\u00a0clone for an ancient machine with an OPL3 compatible sound chip, maybe this is the best way to do the theme song? If youre working on exactly that, by some strange coincidence, be sure to let us know when youre done!", "title": "- WAV\u97f3\u58f0\u3092OPL3\u7528\u306e\u5408\u6210\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "WAV\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092OPL3\u7528\u306e\u5408\u6210\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u97f3\u306f\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u53e4\u98a8\u3002", "titles": ["- WAV\u97f3\u58f0\u3092OPL3\u7528\u306e\u5408\u6210\u6307\u793a\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aWAV2VGM\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u53e4\u3044\u97f3\u8cea\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01OPL3\u7528\u97f3\u697d\u5909\u63db\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067WAV\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u697d\u66f2\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b", "- \u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\uff1aWAV2VGM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

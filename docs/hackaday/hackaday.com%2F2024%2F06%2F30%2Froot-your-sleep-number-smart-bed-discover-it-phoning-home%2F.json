No? Well, you can get root access to one, too, as [Dillan] shows, and if youre lucky, find a phone-home backdoor-like connection. The backstory to this hack is pretty interesting, too!\nYou see, a Sleep Number bed requires a network connection for its smart features, with no local option offered. Not to worry  [Dillan] wrote a Homebridge plugin thatd talk the cloud API, so you could at least meaningfully work with the bed data. However, the plugin got popular, Sleep Number didnt expect the API to be that popular. When they discovered the plugin, they asked that it be shut down. Tech-inclined customers are not to be discouraged, of course.\n\nTaking a closer look at the hardware, [Dillan] found a UART connection and dumped the flash, then wrote an extensive tutorial on how to tap into your beds controller, which runs Linux, and add a service you can use locally to query bed data and control the bed  just like it should have been from the beginning. Aside from that, hes found a way to connect this hub to a network without using Sleep Numbers tools, enabling fully featured third-party use  something that the company doesnt seem to like. Another thing hes found is a reverse SSH tunnel back into the Sleep Number network.\nNow, it can be reasonable to have a phone-home tunnel, but that doesnt mean you want it in your personal network, and it does expose a threat surface that might be exploited in the future, which is why you might want to know about it. Perhaps youd like to use Bluetooth instead of WiFi. Having this local option is good for several reasons. For example, having your smart devices rely on the manufacturers server is a practice that regularly results in perma-bricked smart devices, though weve been seeing some examples of dedicated hackers bringing devices back to life. Thanks to this hack, once Sleep Number shutters, is bought out, or just wants to move on, their customers wont be left with a suddenly dumbed-down bed they can no longer control.\n[Header image courtesy of Sleep Number]", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Sleep Number\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001[Dillan]\u306f\u305d\u308c\u306broot\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u3002\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306bLinux\u304c\u8d70\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u3001\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "DIY\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u6539\u9020\u4e8b\u4f8b", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u3067\u884c\u3046", "\u304a\u3046\u3061\u3067\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff1a\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

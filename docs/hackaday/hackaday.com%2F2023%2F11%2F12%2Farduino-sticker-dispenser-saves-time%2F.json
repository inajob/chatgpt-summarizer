It might just be applying the various warning stickers to the outside of the shipping box. Luckily, [Mr Innovative] has built an open-source automatic sticker dispenser that does the peeling for you, while advancing the roll one at a time quite satisfyingly.\nThis tidy build is made primarily of 2020 extruded aluminium and stainless steel smooth rod. All the yellow bits are 3D printed. The brains of this operation is an Arduino Nano, with an A4988 stepper motor driver controlling a NEMA17.\nOur favorite part of this build is the IR sensor pair arranged below the ready sticker. It detects when a sticker is removed, then the stepper advances the roll by one sticker height. The waste is collected on a spool underneath.\nBetween the video and the instructions, [Mr Innovative] has made it quite simple to build one for yourself. Definitely check this one out after the break.\n[Mr Innovative] may as well go by [Mr. Automation]. Check out this automated wire prep machine from a few years ago.\n\n"}

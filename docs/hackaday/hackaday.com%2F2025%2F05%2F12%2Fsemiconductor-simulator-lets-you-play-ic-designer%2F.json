[Brandon] has a simulator, too, but it simulates semiconductor devices. With help from [Paul Falstad], that simulator also runs in the browser.\nThis simulator takes a little thinking and lets you build devices as you might on an IC die. The key is to use the drop-down that initially says Interact to select a tool. Then, the drop-down below lets you select what you are drawing, which can be a voltage source, metal, or various materials you find in semiconductor devices, like n-type or a dielectric.\nIt is a bit tricky, but if you check out the examples first (like this diode), it gets easier. The main page has many examples. You can even build up entire subsystems like a ring oscillator or a DRAM cell.\nDesigning at this level has its own quirks. For example, in the real world, you think of resistors as something you can use with great precision, and capacitors are often sloppy. On an IC substrate, resistors are often the sloppy component. While capacitor values might not be exact, it is very easy to get an extremely precise ratio of two capacitors because the plate size is tightly controlled. This leads to a different mindset than you are used to when designing with discrete components.\nOf course, this is just a simulation, so everything can be perfect. If, for some reason, you dont know about the Falstad simulator, check it out now.", "title": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Falstad\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3001\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Falstad\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u56de\u8def\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "IC\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u9055\u3044", "\u5177\u4f53\u4f8b\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30b3\u30c4"]}

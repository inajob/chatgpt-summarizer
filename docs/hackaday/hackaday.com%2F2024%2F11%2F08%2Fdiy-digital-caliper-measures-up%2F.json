But, then again, you are reading Hackaday, so we probably dont need to explain it.\nThe motivation, in this case, was to learn to build the same mechanism the commercial ones use for use in precise positioning systems. We were especially happy to see that [Kevins] exploration took him to a Hackaday.io project which led to collaboration between him and [Mitko].\n\nThe theory behind the mechanism is simple but does get into some ugly-looking trigonometry. Electrically, you feed eight sine waves with different phases into the assembly and measure the phase of the signal you receive.\nPulse density modulation is sufficient for the driving signals. The math is a bit more complex, but nothing you cant do with a modern CPU. To set the correct parameters, a PC-based test setup allowed different runs to determine the best parameters for the final implementation.\nOf course, the whole thing still needs some packaging to use as either a practical pair of calipers or for unrelated positioning duty. But it does work and it should be straightforward to adapt it for any purpose.\nWeve looked inside calipers before. If you are only making measurements with calipers one way, you may be missing out."}

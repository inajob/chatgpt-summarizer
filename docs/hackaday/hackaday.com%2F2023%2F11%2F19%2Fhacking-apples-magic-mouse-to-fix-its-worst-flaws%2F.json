It was sleek, low-profile, and featured a touch pad on the top for gestures. Although the first generation was powered by two AA batteries and didnt lead to much commentary, the 2015 redesign caused a lot of scathing memes and worse, mostly due to the rechargeable battery and the Lightning charging port that had been located on its bottom, leading to Dead Magic Mouse syndrome when you wanted to charge it. Since then myriad hackers have tried to fix the Magic Mouses issues, with [Ivan Kuleshov]s recent attempt being perhaps the most straightforward and possibly successful.\nEssentially, the Magic Mouse has two major flaws: ergonomics and the worst possible location of the charging port. Although both 3D models and commercial products exist to alleviate the former issue  and some of these even add wireless charging in between mousing sessions  all attempts to relocate the charging port were met by failure, as the Magic Mouse cannot be both charged and used at the same time due to how Apple designed the circuit.\nWhat [Ivan] did differently is that aside from tweaking some existing 3D models for Magic Mouse extensions to his liking, he also fixed the charging issue by avoiding Apples circuitry altogether and adding a USB-C port in the process. He also added a TP4056-based charging module, directly soldered to the batterys terminals, that will top off the battery when plugged in. During experimentation on a live Magic Mouse, this led to the battery charge reported in MacOS increasing correspondingly. More or less, at least.\nThe 3D printed shell isnt just a wrapper around the original mouse either, but splits the squat rodent into its upper and lower sections, so that the optical sensor isnt suspended off the surface, while also keeping the touch-sensitive top section where it should be. According to [Ivan] the project files will be made available on his GitHub account in the near future.", "title": "\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306e\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bUSB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u5145\u96fb\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "body": "\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u304c2009\u5e74\u306b\u6700\u521d\u306b\u767a\u58f2\u3057\u305fMagic Mouse\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u5927\u304d\u304f\u5909\u308f\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4f4e\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u306f\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u4fee\u6b63\u3067\u306f\u3001USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306e\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bUSB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u5145\u96fb\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a3D\u5370\u5237\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u826f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u516c\u958b", "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u5411\u4e0a\uff01\u5145\u96fb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

The thinking goes that when your display is head mounted, why carry around a screen with your laptop.\n\nOn top its a keyboard, but underneath its a compartmentalized space similar to the Japanese lunchboxes which lend the project its name. The computing power comes courtesy of a Steam Deck so it has a USB-C-for-everything approach to plugging in a desktop, though theres a stated goal to produce versions for other boards such as the Raspberry Pi. Theres even an empty compartment for storage of peripherals.\nWe like this computer, both for being a cyberdeck and for being without a screen so not quite like the other cyberdecks. Its polished enough that we could almost imagine it as a commercial product. Its certainly not the first Steam Deck based cyberdeck weve seen.", "title": "- \u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cBento\u300d", "body": "Bento\u306f\u3001\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u7528\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3002Steam Deck\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u53ce\u7d0d\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cBento\u300d", "- \u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad", "- \u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u578b\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ef\u30f3PC\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u53ce\u7d0d\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305f\u300cBento\u300d\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3"]}

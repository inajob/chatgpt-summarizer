The thinking goes that when your display is head mounted, why carry around a screen with your laptop.\n\nOn top its a keyboard, but underneath its a compartmentalized space similar to the Japanese lunchboxes which lend the project its name. The computing power comes courtesy of a Steam Deck so it has a USB-C-for-everything approach to plugging in a desktop, though theres a stated goal to produce versions for other boards such as the Raspberry Pi. Theres even an empty compartment for storage of peripherals.\nWe like this computer, both for being a cyberdeck and for being without a screen so not quite like the other cyberdecks. Its polished enough that we could almost imagine it as a commercial product. Its certainly not the first Steam Deck based cyberdeck weve seen."}

The idea of a machine which could do the job of both those processors in hardware while containing neither would have blown the mind of any 1980s computer enthusiast, yet thats exactly what [Roelh]s Isetta TTL computer does. Its an extremely clever design whose targeted microcode allows the processor-swap trick, and since hes brought it from prototype to production and has it running SymbOS since we last saw it, its time we gave it another look.\nAll the functions on what is a surprisingly compact board.\nThe video below the break shows the machine in action, with the Windows 95-like SymbOS GUI running a series of sound tests in the emulated AY-3-8910 sound generator, as well as a\u00a0Lemmings-like game. It also runs Sinclair ZX Spectrum software, giving it access to a huge library.\nWe were lucky enough to see some of this in person when we encountered it for a second time on our travels during the summer  and its just as impressive in the real as it looks in the video. The feeling really hits you of how this would have blown away anything on the 8-bit market in 1985, made more impressive by the silicon in use being not too far from what was available at the time.\nWere told you can now buy one for yourself as a kit, and were looking forward to seeing it generate an ecosystem. Were particularly curious as to whether that retargetable microcode could allow it to support other archetctures of the day.\nOur original coverage can be read here, and weve also touched upon SymbOS.\n\n"}

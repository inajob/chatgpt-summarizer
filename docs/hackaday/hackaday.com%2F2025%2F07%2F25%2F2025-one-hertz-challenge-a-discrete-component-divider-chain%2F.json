Its usual to have a 32.768 kHz crystal and a 15-stage divider chain, which in turn normally sits inside an integrated circuit. Not so for [Bobricius], whos created just such a divider chain using discrete components.\nThe circuit of a transistor divider is simple enough, and hes simply replicated it fifteen times in surface mount parts on a PCB with an oscillator forming the remaining square in a 4 by 4 grid. In the video below the break we can see him measuring the frequency at each point, down to the final second. Its used as the timing generator for an all transistor clock, and as we can see it continues that trend. Below the break is a video showing all the frequencies in the chain.\nThis project is part of our awesome 2025 One Hertz Challenge, for all things working on one second cycles. Enter your own things that go tick and tock, wed live to see them!\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

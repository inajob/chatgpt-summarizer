The manufacturer had locked them down, and a franchisee with a broken machine had no option but to call them for an expensive repair job. iFixit and Public Knowledge challenged this with a request for a DMCA exemption from the Copyright Office, and now news emerges that this has been granted.\nThe exemption in question isnt specific to McDonalds, instead it applies to retail food preparation equipment in general, which includes ice-cream machines. Were guessing that franchisees wont be breaking out the screwdrivers either, instead its likely to lower significantly the cost of a service contract for them and any other food industry operators hit with the same problem. Meanwhile any hackers whove picked up an old machine can now fix it themselves without breaking the law, and maybe the chances of your local Mickey Ds having no McFlurries have gone down.\nThis story has featured more than once on these pages, so catch up here, and here."}

Sure, growing crystals takes time, but its not exactly hard work. But [Les] isnt in the market for any old crystals. Rather, he needs super-sized, optically clear crystals of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, or KDP, which are useful as frequency doublers for lasers. [Les] has detailed his need for KDP crystals before and even grown some nice ones, but he wanted to step up his game and grow some real whoppers.\nAnd boy, did he ever. Fair warning; the video below is long and has a lot of detail on crystal-growing theory, but its well worth it for anyone taking the plunge. [Les] ended up building an automated crystal lab, housing it in an old server enclosure for temperature and dust control. The crystals are grown on a custom-built armature that slowly rotates in a supersaturated solution of KDP which is carefully transitioned through a specific temperature profile under Arduino control. As a bonus, he programmed the rig to take photographs of the growing crystals at intervals; the resulting time-lapse sequences are as gorgeous as the crystals, one of which grew to 40 grams in only a week.\nWere keen to see how [Les] puts these crystals to work, and to learn exactly what a Pockels Cell is and why youd want one. In the meantime, if youre interested in how the crystals that make the whole world work are made, check out our deep dive into silicon.\n\n\nThanks to [Joseph Hopfield] for the tip."}

Why not let a water jet do it for you? Itll be cleaner and more precise to boot, and [Jo_Journey] is here to show us how.\u00a0\nSo sharp!\nObviously, youll need a water jet machine, theres no getting around that. Youll also still have to do the basic preparation of the pumpkin yourself\u2014cutting a porthole into the top and mucking it out is your job. With that done, you must then mount the pumpkin on two metal rods which will be used to mount it in the water jet machines working area.\nYou can then create a vector file of your design, and use your chosen software to generate the G-code to run the water jet. [Jo_Journey] uses Scribe, and recommends cutting at a speed of around 200 in/min at low pressure. Remember, its pumpkin youre cutting, not high-strength steel.\nThere is some inaccuracy, of course\u2014your pumpkins surface is not a flat plane, after all\u2014but the results are good enough for most Halloween-related purposes. Even despite the geometrical issues, though, [Jo_Journey] shows us that you can get pleasantly sharp edges on your design. Thats very hard to achieve by hand!\nWe do love a good holiday hack around these parts, even if its out of season. If youve been cooking up your own pumpkinous plans, dont hesitate to let us know! Earlier is sometimes better\u2014after all, who has time to hack together a project if youve just read about it on October 29?"}

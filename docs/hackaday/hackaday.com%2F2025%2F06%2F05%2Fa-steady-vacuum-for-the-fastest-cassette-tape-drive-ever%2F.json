These refrigerator-sized units had a superficial resemblance to an audio tape deck, but with the tape hanging down in a loop either side of the head assembly. This loop was held by a vacuum to allow faster random access speeds at the head, and this fascinates [Thorbj\u00f6rn Jemander]. Hes trying to create a cassette tape drive that can load 64 kilobytes in ten seconds, so hes starting by replicating the vacuum columns of old.\nThe video below is the first of a series on this project, and aside from explaining the tape drives operation, its really an in-depth exploration of centrifugal fan design. He discovers that its speed rather than special impeller design that matters, and in particular a closed impeller delivers the required vacuum. We like his home-made manometer in particular.\nWhat he comes up with is a 3D printed contraption with a big 12 volt motor on the back, and a slot for a cassette on the front. It achieves the right pressure, and pulls the tape neatly down into a pair of loops. Wed be curious to know whether a faster motor such as you might find in a drone would deliver more for less drama, but we can see the genesis of a fascinating project here. Definitely a series to watch.\nMeanwhile, if your interest extends to those early machine rooms, have a wallow in the past.\n\n", "title": "- 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u300164KB\u309210\u79d2\u3067\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3092\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\uff0164KB\u309210\u79d2\u3067\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6", "- \u771f\u7a7a\u30ab\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u63a2\u6c42", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- \u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30d5\u30e5\u2015\u30ac\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

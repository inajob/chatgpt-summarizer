[PlasmatronX] drives that last point home with his camera for sound waves, thats even able to capture constructive and destructive interference. (Video, embedded below.)\nYou may have heard of Schlieren imaging, which is usually used to capture the movement of air currents caused by heat sources. [PlasmatronX] sets up a concave mirror to amplify the refraction of different densities of air, only unlike traditional Schlieren setups, hes after the different densities of air caused by the pressure waves that we interpret as sound.\n\nTo capture the sound waves, you could have a camera with the shutter speed to match, but cameras with that ability run quite a premium. The route taken by [Plasma] uses a cleverly synced audio and optical capture system. Even this wasn\u2019t easy, though. Audio circuits have to be modified to remove high-pass filters, and the LED flash has to be overvolted to allow for the quick strobe.\nIf you want your own try with visualizing sound, check out [PlasmatronX]\u2019s GitHub project here! While this particular imaging technique may be new for us, crazy imaging certainly isn\u2019t in the general sense. For example, check out this camera for something even crazier, light!\n"}

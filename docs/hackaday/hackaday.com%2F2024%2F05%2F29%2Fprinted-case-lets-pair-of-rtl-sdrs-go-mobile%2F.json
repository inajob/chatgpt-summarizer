But when has that ever stopped us from appreciating a nice design when we see one?\nInside the ventilated enclosure is the aforementioned pair of RTL-SDR Blog V4 (SDRs), as well as a StarTech USB hub that theyre plugged directly into. It seems like it wouldnt take much to adapt this design to any other pair of USB gadgets, such as flash drives or WiFi adapters.\nIn fact, if theyre smaller than the RTL-SDR [Jay] has used here, you could probably get away with only needing to modify the one side panel of the case.\nThe simple modularity of the design, with two end pieces and the top and bottom plates, makes such modifications easy as you dont need to reprint the whole thing if you just want a different antenna aperture. It also makes it easy to print without support material, and with just a few tweaks, looks like it could be adapted to use laser-cut panels for the sides. This would not only be faster than printing, but depending on the material, could make for a very stout enclosure.\nWeve covered several designs from [Jay] over the years, including a number of heavy-duty mobile doomsday computers that certainly fit in with this same design aesthetic. After all, why not face the end of the world with a little style?"}

Now, all it takes is a Raspberry Pi and an off-the-shelf TFT display, as [ZitaoTech] shows us.\nThe resemblance to a Blackberry isnt a coincidence\nAdmittedly, we are now seeing these all over the place, but this build looks well thought out. It looks suspiciously like a Blackberry, which isnt a bad thing. It also has an interesting dual-battery system that lets you swap between two identical Nokia BL-5C batteries without missing a beat.\nThe device looks like a Blackberry because it uses the Q10 or Q20 Blackberry keyboard. There is a pass-through switch that lets you use the keyboard and pointer as a USB device on a different host computer.\nRounding out the design are three USB ports, an I2C port, and a TF card slot. Size-wise, the device is about 140 mm tall and 82 mm wide. The thickness is less than 16 mm. Even with the batteries, it weighs a lot less than 200 grams.\nIn the Something-you-can-try directory, there are images for Windows 3.1, mini VMAC, and  of course  DOOM. As you might expect, most of the project is 3D printing the intricate case.\nWeve seen similar projects, including one that has a case inspired by the ZX Spectrum.

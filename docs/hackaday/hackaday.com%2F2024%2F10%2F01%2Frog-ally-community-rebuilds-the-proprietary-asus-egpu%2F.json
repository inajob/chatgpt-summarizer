You might remember the ROG Ally, a Steam Deck-like x86 gaming console thats graced our pages a couple lf times. Now, this is a big one  from the ROG Ally community, we get a fully open-source eGPU adapter for the ROG Ally, built by reverse-engineering the proprietary and overpriced eGPU sold by Asus.\nWeve seen this journey unfold over a years time, and the result is glorious  two different PCBs, one of them an upgraded drop-in replacement board for the original eGPU, and another designed to fit a common eGPU form-factor adapter. The connector on the ROG Ally is semi-proprietary, but its cable could be obtained as a repair part. From there, it was a matter of scrupulous pinout reverse-engineering, logic analyzer protocol captures, ACPI and BIOS decompiling, multiple PCB revisions and months of work  what we got is a masterpiece of community effort.\nDo you want to learn how the reverse-engineering process has unfolded? Check out the Diary.md  its certainly got something for you to learn, especially if you plan to walk a similar path; then, make sure to read up all the other resources on the GitHub, too! This achievement follows a trend from the ROG Ally community, with us having featured dual-screen mods and battery replacements before  if it continues the same way, who knows, maybe next time we will see a BGA replacement or laser fault injection.", "title": "ROG Ally\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eeGPU\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "ROG Ally\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u304cAsus\u306e\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306aeGPU\u3092\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eeGPU\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306f\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u57fa\u677f\u3084\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u57fa\u677f\u306a\u3069\u3092\u542b\u3080\u3002Diary.md\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["ROG Ally\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eeGPU\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "ROG Ally\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u529b\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\uff1aDiary.md", "ROG Ally\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3084\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4ea4\u63db\u306b\u7d9a\u304d", "\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u52aa\u529b\uff1aROG Ally\u7528eGPU\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c"]}

Maybe they have a cat that likes to escape every chance it gets, or maybe their favorite TV show is on during prime trick-or-treating time. Whatever the case, we think its perfectly acceptable to leave a bowl of candy outside the door, especially if there are electronics involved.\nIn this case, the bowl detects trick-or-treaters and candy eaters using an LD2410 60 GHz radar sensor and an RP2040. A light pipe shows orange when a person is detected, and switches over to green as they come closer, as if to say you may have candy now.\nNothing happens after that, but now that we think about it, it would be cool to add an MP3 decoder and a speaker to play a little witch cackle or something once theyve had a chance to stick their hand in the bucket.\n[Mike Kushnerik] actually designed the PCB a few months ago for non-Halloween purposes: some home automation projects. But then they were trying to think of something for Halloween, and this delightful light-up bucket came to mind. In addition to the RP2040 chip, theres a 128 MB flash chip, a WS2812 LED, and a header for communicating with the radar sensor over UART. Be sure to check out the brief demo video after the break.\nIf youd like to stand outside and give out candy, at least send it down a light-up slide or something.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "60GHz\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5149\u308b\u304a\u83d3\u5b50\u5165\u308c", "body": "\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u306b\u30c9\u30a2\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u300260 GHz\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u4eba\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3057\u3001\u7dd1\u8272\u306e\u5149\u3067\u30a2\u30d4\u30fc\u30eb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u3092\u53d6\u3063\u305f\u5f8c\u306f\u4f55\u3082\u8d77\u3053\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001MP3\u30c7\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3084\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["60GHz\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5149\u308b\u304a\u83d3\u5b50\u5165\u308c", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30aa\u30a2\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u304a\u83d3\u5b50\u30dc\u30a6\u30eb", "\u5149\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u3067\u4eba\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3057\u3001\u304a\u83d3\u5b50\u306e\u6709\u7121\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30a6\u30eb", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7528\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305fPCB\u3092\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u7528\u306b\u6d3b\u7528", "RP2040\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306860GHz\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u5149\u308b\u30d0\u30b1\u30c4\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af"]}

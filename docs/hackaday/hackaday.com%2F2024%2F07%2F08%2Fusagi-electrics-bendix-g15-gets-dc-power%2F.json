This week he is joined by a new friend, [Lloyd] who is restoring a G15 as well. [Lloyd] used to repair the Bendix Computers back in the 1970s, so hes privy to lots of practical knowledge you cant find in the manuals.\nThe goal this week was to apply DC power to the G15.\u00a0 The AC power spins the fans and makes the tubes start glowing. But DC makes the magic happen.\u00a0 Thats when the boot sequencers start running, sending data to the drum, testing various parts of the machine, and finally, loading software from the paper tape reader.\nSince this was a computer from the 1950s, powering up DC might work, or could let the magic smoke out.\u00a0 The only way to find out was to push the big green Reset button.\nThe first attempt was stymied by a blown fuse. The second attempt resulted in real live blinkenlights. The data and status lights on the Bendix lit up for the first time in decades. The only thing missing was the sound of the tape drive.\u00a0 A bit of digging proved that the problem wasnt in the computer, but in the typewriter user console. The typewriter supplies -20 volts DC to the Bendix. Since that voltage wasnt getting to the computer, the boot process halted.\nUnfortunately, the typewriter has somebodys been here before syndrome  in addition to age, there are a number of odd modifications.\u00a0 Its going to take [Usagi] a bit of time to dig into it and figure out whats wrong.\nThe good news is that the computer is using its massive spinning drum drive. [Usagi] was able to verify this with the test panel inside the machine. One button will write a pulse to the drum, and another will erase it. Manipulating these buttons, [Usagi] could see the results on an oscilloscope.\u00a0 This may sound simple  but just getting to this point means an incredibly complex chain of tube, relay, and mechanical logic has to work.\u00a0 Bravo [Dave] and [Lloyd]!\n\n"}

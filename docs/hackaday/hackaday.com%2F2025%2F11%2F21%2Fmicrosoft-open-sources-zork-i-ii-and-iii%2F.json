These being pathetically undersized compared to even a PDP-10 meant that Zork got put to the axe, producing Zork I through III. Originally distributed by Infocom, eventually the process of Microsoft gobbling up game distributors and studios alike meant that Microsoft came to hold the license to these games. Games which are now open source as explained on the Microsoft Open Source blog.\nAlthough the source had found its way onto the Internet previously, its now officially distributed under the MIT license, along with accompanying developer documentation. The source code for the three games can be found on GitHub, in separate repositories for Zork I, Zork II and Zork III.\nWe previously covered Zorks journey from large systems to home computers, which was helped immensely by the Z-machine platform that the games code was ported to. Sadly the original gamess MDL code was a bit much for 8-bit home computers. Regardless of whether you prefer the original PDP-10 or the Z-machine version on a home computer system, both versions are now open sourced, which is a marvelous thing indeed."}

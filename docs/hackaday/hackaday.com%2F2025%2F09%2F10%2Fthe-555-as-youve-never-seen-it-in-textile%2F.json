Theyve never shied from adopting innovation: churro sheep from the Spanish in the 17th century, aniline dies in the 19th, and in the 20th and 21st integrated circuits? At least one Navajo Weaver, [Marilou Schultz] thinks theyre a good match for the traditional geometric forms. Her latest creation is a woven depiction of the venerable 555 timer.\nPopular Chip by Marilou Schultz. Photo courtesy of First American Art Magazine, via righto.com\nThis isnt the first time [Marilou] has turned an IC into a Navajo rug; shes been weaving chip rugs since 1994 including a Pentium rug commissioned by Intel that hangs in USAs National Gallery of Artbut its somehow flown below the Hackaday radar until now. The closest thing weve seen on these pages was a beaded bracelet embedding a QR code, inspired by traditional Native American forms.\nThats why were so thankful to [VivCocoa] for the tip. Its a wild and wonderful world out there, and we cant cover all of it without you. Are there any other fusions of tradition and high-tech weve been missing out on? Send us a tip."}

These days, theyre mostly the preserve of doctors and a few other niche operators. [Kyle Tryon] is bringing the beeper back, though, with a custom ESP32-based build.\nThe ESP32 is a great microcontroller for this kind of project, because its got WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity built right in. This let [Kyle] write some straightforward code so that it could receive alerts via MQTT. In particular, its set up to go off whenever theres an app or service notification fired off by the Sentry platform. For [Kyle]s line of work, its effectively an on-call beeper that calls them in when a system needs immediate attention. When it goes off, it plays the ringtone of your choice\u2014with [Kyle] making it capable of playing tunes in Nokias old-school RTTTL music format.\nThe code was simple enough, and the assembly wasnt much harder. By starting with an Adafruit ESP32 Reverse TFT Feather, the screen and buttons were all ready to go right out of the box. [Kyle] merely had to print up a rad translucent case on a resin printer to make it look like a sweet fashionable beeper from the 90s.\nIts a fun little project that should prove useful, while also being nicely reminiscent of a technology that has largely fallen by the wayside.\n"}

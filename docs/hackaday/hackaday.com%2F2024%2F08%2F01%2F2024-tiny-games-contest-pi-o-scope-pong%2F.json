A Raspberry Pi takes care of the grunt work of signal generation, and even uses the two joysticks of an Xbox controller (connected to the Pi over Bluetooth) for inputs.\nOriginally, [Aaron] attempted to generate the necessary signals directly from the Pis PWM outputs by doing a little bit of RC filtering on the outputs, but was repulsed by the smeary results. The solution? An old but perfectly serviceable 8-bit MAX506 DAC now handles crisping up the visuals with high-quality analog outputs. Code is available on the projects GitHub repository.\nThere isnt any score-keeping or sound, but one thing that it has over the original Pong is a round ball. The ball in the original Pong game was square, but mainly because cost was a concern during design and generating a round ball would have ballooned the part count.\nIn many ways, Pong itself is a great inspiration for the Tiny Games Challenge, because the simplicity of its gameplay was likely a big part of its success.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4e0a\u306ePong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u30448\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306eMAX506 DAC\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fPi-O-Scope-Pong\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u7403\u3068\u30d1\u30c9\u30eb\u3092\u63cf\u753b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306eGitHub\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u304b\u3089\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306ePong\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4e0a\u306ePong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "Xbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPong\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8DAC\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30d7\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u5411\u4e0a", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8\u306b\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d4\u30f3\u30dd\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

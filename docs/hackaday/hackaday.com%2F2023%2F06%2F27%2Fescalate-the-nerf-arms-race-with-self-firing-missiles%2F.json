But just as with real-world weapons of the type superpowers put in shows of military strength, theres an arms race in the world of NERF. Mere darts arent enough, and theres a range of missiles for the bellicose youngster intent on skirting the brink of global foam dart annihilation. These come with a catch though in the shape of a lackluster launcher, and this has prompted [Joel Creates] to create a self-firing NERF missile with a secondary rocket motor.\nA supercapacitor stores enough energy to light a small scrap of guncotton explosive when sent through a heater coil, and this should be enough to launch the missile. Perhaps this whole video should sit in Dont try this at home kids territory, but try he does, with multiple dead ends along the way. The final try is a secondary rocket motor inside the missile thats triggered by a micro switch upon leaving the standard NERF launcher. Its not a resounding success, but were sure youll agree its an entertaining video to get there.\nWeve featured quite a few NERF hacks over the years, including this large auto-aimer.\n\n"}

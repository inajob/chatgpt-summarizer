Its not just USB jump drives that can get corrupted, though. Any storage medium can become unusable if certain actions are being taken when the power is suddenly removed. That includes the SD cards on Raspberry Pis, too, and if your power isnt reliable you might consider this hat to ensure they shut down properly during power losses.\nThe Raspberry Pi hat is centered around a series of supercapacitors which provide power for the Pi temporarily. The hat also communicates with the Pi to let it know there is a loss of power, so that the Pi can automatically shut itself down in that situation to prevent corrupting the memory card. The hat is more than just a set of backup capacitors, though. The device is capable of taking input power from a wide range of sources and filtering it for the power requirements of the Pi, especially in applications like boats and passenger vehicles where the input power might be somewhat noisy. Theres an optocoupled CAN bus interface as well for those looking to use this for automotive applications.\nThe entire project is also available on the projects GitHub page for those wishing to build their own. Some sort of power backup is a good idea for any computer, though, not just Raspberry Pis. Weve seen uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) with enough power to run an entire house including its computers, to smaller ones thatll just keep your Internet online during a power outage.\n\n"}

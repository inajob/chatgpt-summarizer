So just remember that.\nCase in point: I was typing up this very issue when I heard from [Jay Crutti] and [Marcel Erz]. Both are out there making replacement keyboards for TRS-80s  [Jay] for Models 3 and 4, and [Marcel] for the Model 1. Oooh, I said to myself. This is going at the top.\nA TRS-80 Model 4. Image by [Jay Crutti] via JayCrutti.comRelevant tangent time: I remember in the 90s having a pile of computers in my parents basement of various vintages, a TRS-80 Model 2 among them. (Did I ever tell you about the time I got pulled over for speeding with a bunch of different computers in the backseat? I was like no, officer, first of all, those are old machines that no one would really want, and I swear I didnt steal them.)\nI think the TRS-80 is probably the one I miss the most. If I still had it, you can bet I would be using [Jay] and [Marcel]s work to build my own replacement keyboard, which the 40-year-old machine would likely need at this point if the Model 4 is any indication with its failing keyboard contacts.\nTo create the replacements, [Jay] used Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE), Plate  Case Builder, and EasyEDA. Using the schematic from the maintenance manual, he matched the row/column wiring of the original matrix with Cherry MX footprints. Be sure to check out [Jay]s site for a link to the project files, or to purchase parts or an assembled keyboard. On the hunt for TRS-80 parts in general? Look no further than [Marcel]s site.\n\nKeyboards On the Molekula Level\nWhile some focus aesthetically on keyboards, or on comfort, [zzeneg] is simultaneously rocking both and coming up with new keyboard frameworks. Take the open-source Molekula for example.\nImage by [zzeneg] via reddit[zzeneg] really digs modular keyboards and especially the VIK standard for interfacing data between PCBs, which calls for an FPC 12-pin, 0.5 mm pitch connector.\nThe big idea with molekula and future keyboards is to have dumb sides and a smart central module that does the braining and the hosting. Additionally, [zzeneg]s plan is to keep the central PCBs footprint under 100 mm\u00b2 in order to make it more affordable for experimentation. You can see this in the third photo of the gallery.\nThere are a couple of cool things going on in addition to the modularity  the switch footprints cover pretty much anything youd want to use, and [zzeneg] left the hot swap sockets exposed around back. This thing is just cool through and through.\nVia reddit\nThe Centerfold: Alice, 1989 Style\nImage by [Brooklick] via redditI wouldnt mind being chained to [Brooklick]s desk for a while. Would you? What I can tell you is that this is an Alice keyboard, and that those are 1989 keycaps and switches. Dont get too excited unless you also have an Alice; according to [Brooklick], the Space bars are crap, although they do look good.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Chicago No. 3\nAt first glance, the Chicago No. 3 looks a bit like a car thats missing a bumper. But then you look again and see it sitting on round feet firmly planted behind the frame-less keyboard and think, it might be kind of nice to type on this one. And without that extra iron, its probably pretty light and portable, too.\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nGiven all of that, the No. 3 does have an interesting WERTY layout, with the Q appearing on the bottom row. So did the model that sold concurrently, the No. 1 (which did have a frame around the keyboard). The base of the No. 3 was slotted, which made it even lighter to carry around.\nAdditionally, the two models had different ribbon mechanisms. The No. 3 used a 3/8 ribbon that fed through those vertically-oriented spools, which is something I havent seen before. The No. 3 had two additional keys  a Backspace and a Margin Release. Whereas the No. 1 cost $35, the No. 3 went for $50 in early 1900s money (about $1,600 today).\nFunctionally speaking, the two were quite similar. In addition to both having a WERTY keyboard, they each used a typesleeve  a cylindrical component that can be swapped out, much like the IBM Selectrics golf ball type element  and a hammer to print. Interestingly enough, in order to use either model, the typist had to turn the safety off by pulling a hammer extension arm on the left side before typing. Hopefully, nothing terrible happened if you forgot to do this.\nAnd What Do We Think of Hardware Layers?\nMadden was here. Image via AutoKeybo\nWow. This might actually be a good use of image recognition; I am undecided. It certainly looks cool at first blush, anyway. And I hope it makes a little zhoop! sound in the process of working.\nOkay, so, imagine youre sitting there at your split keyboard and need to mouse or enter some digits real fast. With this number, all you have to do is stretch out your fingers for a second and whoosh  the QWERTY retracts, and in its place comes a 10-key on the left and a mouse on the right.\nThats the power of AutoKeybo. Here, watch the demo video. Its only nine seconds long.\n\nSo, lets start with the obvious. This is supposed to be an ergonomic keyboard, given that you dont have to move your hand over to mouse. But you do have to rest your arms on a big plastic box thats two keyboards tall, and that probably isnt good for you. But it is split, and the sides are angled toward one another, so theres that.\nThe cool part is that the trays move independently, so you just stretch out whichever hand is hiding what you need to use real quick. It would be nice to access the mouse without losing the left half of the keyboard. Dont ask me why, it just would. Just so you wouldnt have to move both hands.\nOkay, so how does it work already? Basically, theres a built-in camera that detects the splaying of your fingers to trigger the switch. It has a Raspberry Pi 5 doing all of the crunching, which of course you could use as a standalone computer. Heres a report from someone else who tried it out at CES.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two.

Oh sure, there were a few amateur satellites that somehow managed to get built on a shoestring budget and hitch a ride into space, and while their stories are deservedly the stuff of legends, satellite construction took a very long time to be democratized.\nFast forward a half-dozen or so decades, and things have changed dramatically. Satellite launches are still complex affairs  its still rocket science, after all  but the advent of the CubeSat format and the increased tempo of launches, both national and commercial, has pushed the barriers to private, low-budget launches way, way down. So much so, in fact, that the phrase space startup is no longer something to snicker about.\nOne such group of space entrepreneurs is Quub, Inc., a small company in Lancaster, Pennsylvania which is looking to build and fly a constellation of microsatellites to monitor Earths environment in real-time. Theyre building sats and signing launch deals using consumer-grade technology and modularized construction, and were lucky enough to have Nathaniel Evry, their Chief Research Officer, stop by the Hack Chat. If youve ever wondered what it takes to build hardware that can stand the rigors of launch and then perform a task in space, youll want to tune in for this one.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, June 21 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter. Click that speech bubble to the right, and you\u2019ll be taken directly to the Hack Chat group on Hackaday.io. You don\u2019t have to wait until Wednesday; join whenever you want and you can see what the community is talking about.", "title": "\u30ec\u30b4\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b!? \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "DIY Picosatellites Hack Chat with Nathaniel Evry will be held on June 21.

Weve also spilled our fair share of electronic ink on things people are doing with AI. So naturally when [Jeff Greerling] declares on his blog (and in a video embedded below) that AI is destroying open source, well, we had to take a look.\n[Jeff]s article highlights a problem he and many others who manage open source projects have noticed: theyre getting flooded with agenetic slop pull requests (PRs). Its now to the point that GitHub will let you turn off PRs completely, at which point youve given up a key piece of the hubs functionality. That ability to share openly with everyone seemed like a big source of strength for open source projects, but [Jeff] here is joining his voice with others like [Daniel Stenberg] of curl fame, who has dropped bug bounties over a flood of spurious AI-generated PRs.\nIts a problem for maintainers, to be sure, but its as much a human problem as an AI one. After all, someone set up that AI agent and pointed at your PRs. While changing the incentive structure like removing bug bounties might discourage such actions, [Jeff] has no bounties and the same problem. Ultimately it may be necessary for open source projects to become a little less open, only allowing invited collaborators to submit PRs, which is also now an option on GitHub.\nCombine invitation-only access with a strong policy against agenetic AI and LLM code, and you can still run a quality project. The cost of such actions is that the random user with no connection to the project can no longer find and squash bugs. As unlikely as that sounds, it happens! Rather, it did. If the random user is just going to throw their AI agent at the problem, its not doing anybody any good.\nFirst they came for our RAM, now theyre here for our repos. If it wasnt for getting distracted by the cute cat pictures we might just start to think vibe coding could kill open source. Extra bugs was bad enough, but now we cant even trust the PRs to help us squash them!\n\n", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5371\u6a5f\uff1aAI\u306b\u3088\u308bPR\u306e\u6d2a\u6c34", "body": "AI\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u8105\u304b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u7121\u95a2\u4fc2\u306aPR\u304c\u5897\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u56f0\u96e3\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5371\u6a5f\uff1aAI\u306b\u3088\u308bPR\u306e\u6d2a\u6c34", "AI\u751f\u6210\u306e\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u8105\u304b\u3059", "GitHub\u306e\u900f\u660e\u6027\u304c\u5931\u308f\u308c\u308b\uff1f AI\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u304c\u76f4\u9762\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8ab2\u984c", "\u62db\u5f85\u5236\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\uff1aAI\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

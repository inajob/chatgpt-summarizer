With that gold rush comes plenty of people selling figurative shovels as well, with audio mixing gear, high-quality web cams, and dedicated devices for controlling all of this technology. Often these devices take the form of a tablet-like device, but [Lenochxd] thinks that any tablet ought to be able to perform this task without needing dedicated, often proprietary, hardware.\nThe solution offered here is called WebDeck, an application written in Flask that turns essentially any device with a broswer into a stream control device. Of course it helps to have a touch screen as well, but an abundance of tablets and smartphones in the world makes this a non-issue. With the software running on the host computer, the streamer can control various aspects of that computer remotely by scanning a QR code which opens a browser window with all of the controls accessible from within. It has support for VLC, OBS Studio, and Spotify as well which covers the bases for plenty of streaming needs.\nCurrently the host software only runs on Windows, but [Lenochxd] hopes to have MacOS and Linux versions available soon. Were always in favor of any device that uses existing technology and also avoids proprietary hardware and software. Hopefully thats a recipe to avoid planned obsolescence and unnecessary production. If you prefer a version with a little bit of tactile feedback, though, weve seen other decks which add physical buttons for quick control of the stream.", "title": "WebDeck: \u4efb\u610f\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u5fa1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308bFlask\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea", "body": "YouTube\u3084Twitch\u306a\u3069\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3092\u914d\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Lenochxd\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3059\u308bWebDeck\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3069\u3093\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3082\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u5fa1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Windows\u3067\u306e\u307f\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3060\u304c\u3001MacOS\u3084Linux\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["WebDeck: \u4efb\u610f\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u5fa1\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308bFlask\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea", "\u30bf\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u8981\u3089\u305a\uff01WebDeck\u3067\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u5236\u5fa1\u3092", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u3067\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\uff01WebDeck\u304c\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u7c21\u5358\u306b", "\u30ce\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\uff01WebDeck\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u30ea\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u56de\u907f", "Windows\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3001MacOS\u3068Linux\u3082\u8fd1\u65e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a\u306eWebDeck"]}

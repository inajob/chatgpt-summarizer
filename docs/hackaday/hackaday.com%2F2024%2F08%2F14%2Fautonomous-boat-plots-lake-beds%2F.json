[Clay Builds] has been hard at work on his drone which is actually an autonomous boat, which he uses to map the underwater topography of various lakes. In this video he takes us through the design and build process of this particular vehicle and then demonstrates it in action.\nThe boat itself takes inspiration from sailing catamarans, which have two hulls of equal size connected above the waterline, allowing for more stability and less drag than a standard single-hulled boat. This is [Clay]s second autonomous boat, essentially a larger, more powerful version of one we featured before. Like the previous version, the hulls are connected with a solar panel and its support structure, which also provides the boat with electrical power and charges lithium-iron phosphate batteries in the hull. Steering is handled by two rudders with one on each hull, but it also employs differential steering for situations where more precise turning is required. The boat carries a sonar-type device for measuring the water depth, which is housed in a more hydrodynamic 3d-printed enclosure to reduce its drag in the water, and it can follow a waypoint mission using a combination of GPS and compass readings.\nLike any project of this sort, there was a lot of testing and design iteration that had to go into this build before it was truly seaworthy. The original steering mechanism was the weak point, with the initial design based on a belt connecting the two rudders that would occasionally skip. But after a bit of testing and ironing out these kinks, the solar boat is on its way to measure the waters depths. The projects code as well as some of the data can be found on the projects GitHub page, and if youre looking for something more human-sized take a look at this solar-powered kayak instead.\n\n", "title": "\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7121\u4eba\u8239\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8239\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u304b\u3089\u5efa\u8a2d\u3001\u5b9f\u6f14\u307e\u3067\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30bb\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30bf\u30de\u30e9\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3001\u592a\u967d\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3002GPS\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u3067\u822a\u884c\u3057\u3001\u6c34\u6df1\u8a08\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3092\u91cd\u306d\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u3002Github\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7121\u4eba\u8239\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3068GPS\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u5f8b\u8239\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u6c34\u4e2d\u5730\u5f62\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u7121\u4eba\u8239\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u98a8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u81ea\u5f8b\u8239\u306e\u958b\u767a", "GPS\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u822a\u8def\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u81ea\u5f8b\u8239"]}

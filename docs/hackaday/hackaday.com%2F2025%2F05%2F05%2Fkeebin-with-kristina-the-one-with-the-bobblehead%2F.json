Believe it or not, [nobutternoparm] retrofitted this innocent, adorable little tikes\u00ae so-called Kidboard rubber-dome keyboard into a mechanical marvel. Yeah! No, it wasnt exactly pure, unadulterated fun, nor was it easy to do. But then again nothing worth doing ever is.\nImage by [nobutternoparm] via redditFor one thing, the PCB ended up being a bit too wide, so the bottom half of the case is a bit mangled. But thats okay! Onward and upward.\nNext problem: a real PCB and mechanical switches (Gateron Baby Kangaroos) are a lot taller than the previous arrangement. This required spacers, a mounting plate, and longer screws to hold it all together. Now imagine lining all that up and trying to keep it that way during assembly.\nAnd then theres the keycaps. Guess what? Theyre non-standard because theyre for rubber domes. So this meant more adapters and spacers. Youll see in the gallery.\nSo we know it looks great, but how does it type? Well [nobutternoparm] gives the feel a 4/10. The keycaps now have too many points of contact, so they bind up and have to be mashed down. But its going to be a great conversation piece.\n\nWith a Little Luck, You Could Fly On Wings\nBefore you ask, unfortunately, Wings doesnt seem to be open-source, at least not as of this writing. But based on the comments in the reddit thread, [MoreFruit3042] seems willing to build them for some undisclosed cost.\nImage by [MoreFruit3042] via redditThat touch pad supports multi-touch gesture operations, so right there, you dont have to use the mouse as much. And although its hard to tell from this picture, there is 6\u00b0 inward angle between the halves and a 6\u00b0 front-to-back incline, both of which are designed to match the natural angles of hands.\nI really dig the lowered thumb clusters and the fact that they arent overloaded with keys. There are low-profile Kailh Chocs under there, which makes for quite a slim keyboard.\nWings runs QMK, has RGB lighting, and supports real-time key-mapping with VIAL. Be sure to check out the build video below.\n\nThe Centerfold: A Truly Ergonomic Meal\nImage by [Dexter_Lim] via redditAgain, very little detail to go off of here, but the keyboard is a totem. Couldnt even tell you whats in the right hand (left hand, if you go by the handle orientation) mug. Water, I suppose. But being a two-fisted drinker myself, I can really appreciate this setup, And although the sammy isnt really my type, the extreme tenting on it is a nice touch.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: To the Victor Go the Spoils\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nThe Victor was patented in 1889 and produced until 1892 by the Tilton Manufacturing Company of Boston, Massachusetts. It was invented by Arthur Irving Jacobs.\nProbably the most noteworthy factoid about the Victor Type-Writer is that it was the first production typewriter ever to employ a daisy wheel. This significant achievement showed up in typewriters all throughout the 1970s and 80s. My IBM Wheelwriter 5 uses a daisy wheel, as do my Brother machines.\nThe Victor is of course an index typewriter, as evidenced by the lack of keyboard. To use it, you would simply move the guide to the letter you wanted, which moved the daisy wheel simultaneously. Then youd press the innermost left-hand key to swing the hammer and strike the daisy wheel against the paper. The outer left-hand key is the Space bar.\nVictors were 8 by 12 in their footprint and weighed around 5.25 lbs. They came with wooden cases that were either rectangular or contoured to the shape. The Victor cost $15, which is close to $500 in 2025 money.\nFinally, Theres Gonna Be a Christopher Latham Sholes Bobblehead\nImage via The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum\nSo, this happened. Someone went and made a Christopher Latham Sholes bobblehead. You know, the guy who is responsible for the QWERTY layout.\nIm not sure if this is an honor or an insult. But hey, at least it will probably resemble Sholes more than would one of those Funko things. Plus, itll actually do something.\nHeres hoping the bobblehead itself looks like this image at least in part. One can only wish that there will be a typewriter involved. (Doesnt there almost have to be?)\nThis thing is currently available for pre-order for the low price of $35. You can either have it shipped, or you can pick it up at QWERTYFEST MKE (that means Milwaukee, WI), being held October 3-5.\nSo whats the connection? Sholes hailed from Milwaukee, where was a noted newspaper publisher, politician, and of course, a successful commercial typewriter inventor. Do I want one of these? I may or may not be nodding my head right now.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

These days you are more likely to live with less or no land, and even if you do own property, you might have restrictions that prevent you from putting up any kind of visible antenna.\nBut even if thats not the case, you might not have room for an old-fashioned tri-bander or cubical quad that the hams of old preferred. [Waters  Stanton] has a 65-year-old design for a miniature beam that he explains, and it produces a good beam antenna in a reduced amount of space. You can watch a video about the antenna below.\nThe design uses a doublet  a dipole fed with a balanced line and tuned at the feed point. A 22-foot doublet can cover 20 meters down to 10 meters without traps. Adding a director and reflector element provides directionality and gain. A unique arrangement allowed a 12-foot boom to support multiple elements on some bands by introducing a central coil on some elements. For example, the director is tuned to 15 meters using a center coil. But the coil is shorted with a 10 meter quarter stub that acts as a short on that band. You can see a complete explanation in the video.\nWe were hoping to see a build and some on-the-air testing, but, apparently, that is left as an exercise for the viewer. We imagine that 65 years ago, youd use a grid dip oscillator to tune the stubs. Today, an antenna analyzer would do the job easily.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u5236\u9650\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u3078\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306f\u4ee5\u524d\u306f\u6577\u5730\u3092\u6240\u6709\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5236\u9650\u304c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u5236\u9650\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u300265\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3\u3067\u306f\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u30c0\u30a4\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3002\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u884c\u3046\u5fc5\u8981\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u5236\u9650\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u3078\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "\u571f\u5730\u306b\u5236\u9650\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b9\u3078\uff1a20\u301c10\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\uff01\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3068\u4f5c\u6210\u624b\u9806\u89e3\u8aac\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa"]}

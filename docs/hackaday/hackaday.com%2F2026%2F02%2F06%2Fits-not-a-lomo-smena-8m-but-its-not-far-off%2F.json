Not working with many-thousand-dollar Leicas, but in cheap snapshot cameras that can be had for next to nothing at a thrift store. [Marek Sokal] has a perfect example, in a 3D printed 35mm camera body using the lens and shutter assembly from a vintage Soviet Lomo Smena 8M.\nThe build is a work in progress, a printed assembly that holds the 35mm film cartridge, provides the focal plane for the film, and houses the take-up reel. It fits together with M2 screws, as per the Lomo lens.\nWe like this build, because we can see beyond the Lomo. In a box above the desk where this is being written there is a pile of old plastic snapshot cameras from the 1960s through 1980s, none of which is worth anything much, but all of which have a similar shutter and lens assembly. In many cases its not a huge task to do with them what [Marek] has with the Lomo and mount them to a back like this. The LEGO film camera may not have gained approval, but this prove that making cameras of your own is still pretty easy.", "title": "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3080\u4f8b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u53e4\u3044Lomo\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f35mm\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "- \u81ea\u4f5c35mm\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\uff5e1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b9\u30ca\u30c3\u30d7\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- LEGO\u6620\u753b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u518d\u6311\u6226\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f"]}

[3DprintedLife] set about building a blaster to rectify that last shortcoming, aiming for design that could fire 100 darts per second.\nThe design uses half length darts which tend to fly a little nicer from high-powered blasters. It fires them using belts driven by powerful motors, similar to wheel blasters. The darts themselves are loaded into a drum magazine which has sliders to push the darts into the wheels as the drum rotates by.\nIt all sounds straightforward enough, but getting it all working in harmony is a challenge\u2014particularly at a fire rate of 100 darts per second. The build video explains the trials and tribulations involved in getting near that fire rate, with darts getting shredded and magazines throwing out parts along the way.\u00a0 A good helping of iterative design helps get everything playing nice, with the darts neatly leaving the magazine and flying downrange at great speed. The slow-motion videos of darts flying out of the blaster in rapid succession are a special treat.\nFiles are available via OnShape for those looking to dive deeper into the design. Weve seen some other neat Nerf blasters before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u79d2\u9593100\u767a\u306e\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u767a\u5c04\uff01", "body": "Nerf\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u30011\u79d2\u306b100\u767a\u306e\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u767a\u5c04\u3067\u304d\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u3001\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u99c6\u52d5\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3067\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u767a\u5c04\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u306f\u30ea\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u554f\u984c\u306f\u89e3\u6c7a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306fOnShape\u3067\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u79d2\u9593100\u767a\u306e\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u767a\u5c04\uff01", "\u96fb\u52d5\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u578b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30cb\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u7d1a\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a100\u767a\u306e\u30c0\u30fc\u30c4\u304c\u7206\u901f\u3067\u98db\u3073\u51fa\u3059\uff01", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "Nerf\u304c\u624b\u639b\u3051\u305f\u65b0\u4f5c\u30d6\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u767a\u5c04\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe"]}

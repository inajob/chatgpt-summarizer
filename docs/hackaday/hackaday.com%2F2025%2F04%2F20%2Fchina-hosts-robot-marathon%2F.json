You can check out the action and the Tiangong Ultra robot that won in the video below. The event took place in Beijing and spanned 21.1 km. There was, however, a barrier between lanes for humans and machines.\nThe human rules were the same as youd expect, but the robots did need a few concessions, such as battery swap stops. The winning bot crossed the finish line in just over 160 minutes. However, there were awards for endurance, gait design, and design innovation.\n\nHumans still took the top spots, though. We also noted that some of the robots had issues where they lost control or had other problems. Even the winner fell down once and had three battery changes over the course.\nOf the 21 robots that started, only six made the finish line. We dont know how many of the 12,000 humans finished, but we are pretty sure it was more than six, so we dont think runners have to worry about robot overlords yet. But theyre getting better all the time.\n"}

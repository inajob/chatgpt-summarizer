Weve also written up one or two controllers, but we dont think weve ever seen anything like this  playing DOOM with an electric guitar.\nThe guitar in question is a Schecter Hellraiser Deluxe, which seems like a great choice to us. In order to get the notes to control the game, [DOS Storm] converted a handful of notes to MIDI using a VST plugin called Dodo MIDI 2 and the Reaper DAW. Then it was a matter of converting MIDI to keystrokes. This took two programs  loopMIDI to do take the MIDI data and route it elsewhere, and MIDIKey2Key to actually convert the MIDI to the keystrokes that control DOOM.\nThe result is that the notes that move Doomguy around are mostly in an A-major bar chord formation, with some controls up in the solo range of the fret board. Be sure to check out the demo video below and watch [DOS Storm] clear level one in a fairly impressive amount of time, considering their controller is a guitar.\nThat key cap isnt even the most ridiculous thing weve seen DOOM running on. Its probably a toss-up between that and the LEGO brick.\n\n\nVia adafruit"}

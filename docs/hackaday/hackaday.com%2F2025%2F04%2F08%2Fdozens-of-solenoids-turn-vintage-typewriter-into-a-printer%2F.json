Unfortunately, theres not as much use for these electromechanical beauties, so if you find one, why not follow\u00a0[Konstantin Schauwecker]s lead and turn it into a printer?\nThe portable typewriter [Konstantin] found, a Silver Reed 2200 CR, looks like a model from the early 1980s, just before PCs and word processing software would sound the death knell for typewriters. This machine has short-throw mechanical keys, meaning that a physical press of each key would be needed rather than electrically shorting contacts. Cue the order for 50 low-voltage solenoids, which are arranged in rows using 3D printed holders and aluminum brackets, which serve as heat sinks to keep the coils cool. The solenoids are organized into a matrix with MOSFET drivers for the rows and columns, with snubber diodes to prevent voltage spikes across the coils, of course. A Raspberry Pi takes care of translating an input PDF file into text and sending the right combination of GPIO signals to press each key.\nThe action of the space bar is a little unreliable, so page formatting can be a bit off, but other than that, the results are pretty good. [Konstantin] even managed to hook the printer up to his typewriter keyboard, which is pretty cool, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u52d5\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u591a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u52d5\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 50\u500b\u306e\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- Raspberry Pi\u3067PDF\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3078"]}

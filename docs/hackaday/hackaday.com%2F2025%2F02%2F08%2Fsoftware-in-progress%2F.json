I run almost exclusively open software, and have for longer than I care to admit. And although I\u2019m not a serious coder by an stretch, I fill out bug reports when I find them, and poke at edge cases to help the people who do the real work.\nFor 3D modeling, I\u2019ve been bouncing back and forth between OpenSCAD and FreeCAD. OpenSCAD is basic, extensible, and extremely powerful in the way that a programming language is, and consequently it\u2019s reliably bug-free. But it also isn\u2019t exactly user friendly, unless you\u2019re a user who likes to code, in which case it\u2019s marvelous. FreeCAD is much more of a software tool than a programming language, and is a lot more ambitious than OpenSCAD. FreeCAD is also a program in a different stage of development, and given its very broad scope, it has got a lot of bugs.\nI kept running into some really serious bugs in a particular function \u2013 thickness for what it\u2019s worth \u2013 which is known to be glitchy in the FreeCAD community. Indeed, the last time I kicked the tires on thickness, it was almost entirely useless, and there\u2019s been real progress in the past couple years. It works at least sometimes now, on super-simple geometries, and this promise lead me to find out where it still doesn\u2019t work. So I went through the forums to see what I could do to help, and it struck me that some people, mostly those who come to FreeCAD from commercial programs that were essentially finished a decade ago, have different expectations about the state of the software than I do, and are a lot grumpier.\nOpen source software is working out its bugs in public. Most open source is software in development. It\u2019s growing, and changing, and you can help it grow or just hang on for the ride. Some open-source userland projects are mature enough that they\u2019re pretty much finished, but the vast majority of open-source projects are coding in public and software in progress.\nIt seems to me that people who expect software to be done already are frustrated by this, and that when we promote super-star open projects like Inkscape or Blender, which are essentially finished, we are doing a disservice to the vast majority of useful, but still in progress applications out there that can get the job done anyway, but might require some workarounds. It\u2019s exactly these projects that need our help and our bug-hunting, but if you go into them with the \u201cfinished\u201d mentality, you\u2019re setting yourself up for frustration.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

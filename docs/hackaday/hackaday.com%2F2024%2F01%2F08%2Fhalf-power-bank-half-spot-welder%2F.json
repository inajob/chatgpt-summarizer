[Aaron Christophel] has a battery spot welder that costs a not unreasonable 30 euros and can also be used as a novelty power bank. He subjects it to a test and teardown in the video below the break.\nFirst of all, he conducts a few weld tests, and we have to say it seems capable of some reasonable results if its parameters are correctly adjusted. Then the end comes off the extruded aluminium case, and the guts of the device are slid out for a teardown.\nThe power comes from a pair of Li-Po pouch cells, while on the board, theres an STM32 clone providing the timing for a set of MOSFETs that do the heavy lifting. Theres a colour display for tweaking the settings. Alongside all this, theres also a small chip for that power bank functionality. Charging is via USB-C, though, of course, its not really proper USB-C but a USB-C socket that expects 5 volts. This is a disappointing trend in cheap electronics that sullys the promise of USB-C.\nIt seems this spot welder is capable of doing the job, which is pleasing after our previous disappointing look at battery welders.\n\n"}

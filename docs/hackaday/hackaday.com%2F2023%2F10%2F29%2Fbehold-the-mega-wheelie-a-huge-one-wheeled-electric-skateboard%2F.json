They suspected that a larger wheel was the key to working better on rough ground and dry sand and tested this idea by creating a skateboard with a single wheel. A very big, very wide wheel, in fact.\nThe Mega-Wheelie houses a 24V LiFePO4 battery pack, 450 W gearmotor with chain and sprocket drive, SyRen motor controller from Dimension Engineering, Arduino microcontroller, and an inertial measurement unit to enable the self-balancing function. Steering is done by leaning, and the handheld controller is just a dead mans switch that disables the vehicle if the person piloting it lets go.\nDesign-wise, a device like this has a few challenging constraints. A big wheel is essential for performance but takes up space that could otherwise be used for things like batteries. Also, the platform upon which the pilot stands needs to be as low to the ground as possible for maximum stability. Otherwise, its too easy to fall sideways. On the other hand, one must balance this against the need for sufficient ground clearance.\nBeaches are rarely covered in perfectly smooth and firm sand, making them a good test area.\nIn the end, how well did it work? Well enough to warrant a future version, says [John]. We cant wait to see what that looks like, considering their past 3000 W unicycles only limitation was personal courage and featured a slick mechanism that shifted the pilots weight subtly to aid steering. A video of the Mega-Wheelie (and a more recent unicycle design) is embedded just below the page break.\n\n\nAnd just for reference, here is some of [John]s previous work on a self-balancing unicycle design.\n"}

Envy [Otis Rowell] then, because hes made himself a garden railway with the laudable purpose of moving wood pellets for his heating. A mere garden railway may be cool but its not in itself special, so the reason were featuring it here comes from something else. Hes making his rail wheels by 3D printing them with a normal printer.\nIts important to understand that these wheels are not for a high-speed mainline express freight train but for a small flat car designed to carry a modest tub of pellets, thus they are less in need of high strength than their full-size cousins. But even a small car on garden railway-sized aluminum rails can exert significant force, so we would be fascinated to see how well these do. The write-up is a work in progress as this article is being written so we know theres more to come, but theres no harm in speculating as to how a better 3D-printed wheel might be made. We would be particularly curious for example as to whether a novel slicing regime could be used to make a stronger wheel.\nIf backyard railways interest you, its not the first time weve seen one."}

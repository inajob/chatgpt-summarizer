Normally, we think of dye sublimation, we think of pressing color pictures onto fabric, especially T-shirts. But [Johan] uses a modified Epson inkjet printer and has amazing results, as you can see in the video below.\nThe printers use separate tanks for ink, which seems to be the key. If you already have an Espon tank printer, you are halfway there, but if you dont have one, a cheap one will set you back less than $200 and maybe even less if you pick one up used.\n\nYou have to fill bottles with special dye, of course. You can also use the printer to make things like T-shirts. The idea is to print a dye transfer page and place it on the bed before you start printing. The sublimation dye is activated with heat, and, of course, you are shooting out hot plastic, so the image will transfer to the plastic.\n[Teaching Tech] explains the best settings to make it all work. The results look great and were interested to try this ourselves. Transferring bed images is old hat, but this is something else. Beats liars color printing.\n"}

Now, Adobe has released a paper showing some of the technical details of the process.\n\nThe paper is from the User Interface  Software (UIST) conference in 2022, so the examples it uses are older: it discusses a canvas and handbag. The dress uses the same technology, though, draped over a scientist rather than a frame. If you cant access the version from UIST, [Dierk] has a free version here.\nThe dress uses Polymer-dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) panels from the wonderfully named Shanghai HO HO Industry Co and is designed for use in windows and doors for privacy. It uses an Iridium Tin oxide-coated PET film that is opaque by default but becomes transparent when a voltage difference is applied across the material.\n\nThese panels are shaped to a hexagonal shape, then wired together with flexible PCBs in a daisy chain. Interestingly, [Dierk] found that the smaller the panels were made, the lower the voltage was required to trigger them. For their canvas example, they dropped the voltage to a much safer -15V to 15V levels to trigger the two states, which is much safer for a wearable device.\nThe panels are also not completely transparent when triggered: the paper describes them as having a soft ivory look when they are overlaying a reflective material. Greyscales can also be made using Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM) to vary the panels transparency. Driving the panels at 3.2KHz, they created 64 shades of grey.\nThe main controller is a custom PCB with a Teensy 4.1 and a BlueFruit LE SPI module. The power comes from two 14.8V LiPo batteries, with converters to power the chips and switch modules so the Teensy can switch the -15 and +15V levels for the panels directly from each battery.\nThe array is made from modules, each with four panels connected to a controller PCB, which has several Analog Signal Device (ASD) ADG1414 chips. These receive the signals from the bus with switch registers to switch the panels individually.\nRather cleverly, [Dierk] uses the bus that daisy chains the modules together to deliver both power and the bus signal that controls the panels, using the -15 and +15V levels modulated with a 50Hz square wave to create the bus signal and power the panels at the same time. Thats a neat hack that reduces the complexity of the modules significantly.\nThe Teensy 4.1 controls the whole system and can use its IMU to sense movement and change the pattern accordingly. You dont get to see the systems electronics in the dress video, but they claim that the canvas example took just 0.58 Watts to drive, so the dress probably only needs a few watts.\nIt is a fascinating build (and a rather cute dress), and has a lot of potential.

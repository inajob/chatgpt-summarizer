Forging, welding, milling, grinding; anything to remove metal or push it around from one place to another is fair game when youve got to make something fast. Adding in fancy new tools like CNC plasma cutting and computer-aided drafting doesnt change that much, although new methods often do call for a little improvisation.\nGetting several methodologies to work and play well together is what [tonygoacher] learned all about while trying to fabricate some brackets for an electric trike for next years EMF Camp. The parts would have been perfect for fabrication in a press brake except for the 4 mm thickness of the plate steel, which was a little much for his smallish brake. To make the bending a little easier, [tony] made a partial-thickness groove across the plasma-cut blank, by using a reduced power setting on the cutter. This worked perfectly to guide the brakes tooling, but [tony] ran into trouble with more complicated bends that would require grooves on both sides of the steel plate.\nHis solution was to 3D print a couple of sacrificial guide blocks to fit the bed of the press brake. Each guide had a ridge to match up with a guide groove, this allowed him to cut his partial grooves for both bends on the same side of the plate but still align it in the press brake. Yes, the blocks were destroyed in the process, but they only took a few minutes to print, so no big deal. And its true that the steel tore a little bit when the groove ended up on the outside radius of the bend, but thats nothing a bead of weld cant fix. Good enough for EMF is good enough, after all.\nThe brief video below shows the whole process, including [tony]s interesting SCARA-like CNC plasma cutter, which were a little in love with now. This isnt the first time weve seen 3D prints used as tools in metalworking, of course, but we picked up some great tips from this one.\n", "title": "\u96fb\u52d5\u4e09\u8f2a\u8eca\u7528\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "body": "\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001[tonygoacher]\u306f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u524a\u308a\u30ab\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u66f2\u3052\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u88dc\u52a9\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u51e1\u305d\u6570\u5206\u9593\u306e\u5370\u5237\u3067\u3001\u6eb6\u63a5\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u52d5\u4e09\u8f2a\u8eca\u7528\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "CNC\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u88fd\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u5834\u5408\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

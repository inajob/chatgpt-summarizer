It contains an accelerometer or similar, along with a microcontroller and a pair of motor controllers to drive its in-wheel motors. That recipe is open to interpretation of course and weve seen a few in our time, but perhaps not quite like this steampunk design from [Skrubis]. It claims a hoverboard design with no modern electronics, only relays, mercury switches, and neon bulbs.\nThe idea is that its a hoverboard from 1884 using parts available in that era, hence theres talk of telegraph relays and galvanomic piles. The write-up is presented in steampunk-style language which if were honest makes our brain hurt, but the premise is intriguing enough to persevere. As far as we can see it uses a pair of relays and a transformer to make an oscillator, from which can be derived the drive for a 3-phase motor. This drive is sent to the motors by further relays operating under the influence of mercury tilt switches.\nThere are a full set of hardware designs once you wade past the language, but as yet it has no evidence of a prototype. We admit we kinda want it to work because the idea is preposterous enough to be cool if it ran, but wed be lying if we said we didnt harbor some doubts. Perhaps you our readers can deliver a verdict, after all presenting you with entertainment is what its all about. If a working prototype surfaces well definitely be featuring it, after all it would be cool as heck.\nOddly this isnt the first non-computerized balance transport weve seen.\n\nHeader: Simakovarik, CC BY-SA 4.0."}

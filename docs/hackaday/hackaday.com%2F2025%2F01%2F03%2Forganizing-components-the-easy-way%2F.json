A place to put it. For hackers like [Christian], everything is a hoard of priceless electronic components. His solution is using small zipper bags, either regular plastic or anti-static. These attach using hook and loop fastener to plastic binder sheets which then live in a binder. Combined with some custom printed labels and a few other tricks, it makes for a nice system, as you can see in the video below.\nHonestly, weve done something similar before, using a binder with little pockets, but the bag and custom labels beat our system. He even has QR codes on some of them to locate data sheets easily. Seems like a barcode for inventory management might have been good, too.\n\nSome advice from us. If you are just starting out, this might seem like overkill. But if you start out doing something  this or something else  then ten years from now, you wont have to be like us and think, Id get everything organized, but it is going to take months to work through what I already have That usually makes it a project you never really get started with. Develop good habits early!\nEven if you dont want to store your components this way, his binder hacks probably work for lots of other things, too. It isnt as flashy as some systems weve seen, but it is very practical. If only you didnt have to turn the pages in the binder yourself.\n"}

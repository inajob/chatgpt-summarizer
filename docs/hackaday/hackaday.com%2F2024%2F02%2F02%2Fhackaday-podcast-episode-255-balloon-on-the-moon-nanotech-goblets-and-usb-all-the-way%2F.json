If you know, you know. We had quite a bumper crop of coolness this week, which strangely included two artifacts from ancient Rome: a nanotech goblet of colloidal gold and silver, and a perplexing dodecahedron that ends up having a very prosaic explanation  probably. We talked about a weird antenna that also defies easy description, saw a mouse turned into the worlds worst camera, and learned how 3D-printed signs are a whole lot easier than neon, and not half bad looking either. As always, we found time to talk about space, like the legacy of Ingenuity and whatever became of inflatable space habitats. Back on Earth, theres DIY flux, shorts that walk you up the mountain, and more about USB-C than you could ever want to know.\nAnd dont forget that to celebrate Episode 256 next week, well be doing a special AMA segment where well get all the regular podcast crew together to answer your questions about life, the universe, and everything. If youve got a burning question for Elliot, Tom, Kristina, Al, or Dan, put it down in the comment section and well do our best to extinguish it.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nGrab a copy for yourself if you want to listen offline.\n\nEpisode 255 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nNext week, in honor of Podcast Episode 0 (or 256 if youve got the bits to spare), well be having an Ask-Us-Anything, with as many of the Podcast regulars as we can fit onto one microphone.

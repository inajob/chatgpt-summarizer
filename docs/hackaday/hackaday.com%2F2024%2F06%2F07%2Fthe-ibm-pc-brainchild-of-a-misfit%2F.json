But we enjoyed [Gareth Edwards] perspective in a post entitled The Misfit who Built the IBM PC. The titular character is Don Estridge, a decidedly atypical IBM employee who was instrumental in creating the personal computer market as we know it.\nIts not that IBM invented the personal computer  far from it. But the birth of the PC brought personal computers to the mainstream, especially in offices, and  much to IBMs chagrin  opened up the market for people to make add-on cards for printers, videos, and other accessories.\nIBM was a computer juggernaut in the late 1970s. Its divisions were the size of other companies, and some have compared it to a collection of mafia families. The company was heavily invested in big computers, and management was convinced that personal computing was, at most, an avenue to video games and most likely a fad.\nKnown as a conservative company, the PC project drew from a number of corporate misfits who had been technically successful but often punished for coloring outside the lines. They developed a prototype. The post quotes one of the people involved as saying, The system would do two things. It would draw an absolutely beautiful picture of a nude lady, and it would show a picture of a rocket ship blasting off the screen. We decided to show the Management Committee the rocket ship. Wise choice.\nThats just the kind of tidbit in this post, and if you have any interest in computer history of the 1980s, youll definitely want to check it out. Estridge died in 1985, so he didnt get to see much of the result of the market he opened up. Of course, there were many other players who appear in this story. The PC has many parents, as you might expect.\nWeve done our own recounting of this story. However, we tend to obsess more over the internals."}

When its the latest version of [Kevin Santo Cappuccio]s Jumperless, which uses a bunch of analog crosspoint switches (typically used for handling things like video signals) to create connections instead of physical wires. Theres even an RGB LED under each hole capable of real-time visualization of signals between components.\nIf this looks a bit familiar, thats because an earlier version took second place in the 2023 Hackaday Prize. But things have evolved considerably since then. There are multiple programmable power rails, ADC channels, a rotary encoder, and much more. The PCB design itself is fantastic, including the probe which acts like a multi-function tool for interacting with the whole thing. The newest version will make its debut on Crowd Supply in just a few days.\nIts open source and made to be hackable, so give the GitHub repository a look if you want a closer peek. You can watch it in action in a brief video posted to social media, embedded below.\n\n\nWe (and I cannot stress this enough) are so back.\nJumperless V5 lets you prototype like a nerdy wizard that can see electricity and conjure jumpers wherever you want. And the wait is nearly over for this particular superpower, it launches September 23rd on @crowd_supply. pic.twitter.com/VRr5H9sJD5\n Kevin Santo Cappuccio (@arabidsquid) September 20, 2024\n", "title": "Jumperless V5: \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u6700\u65b0\u306eJumperless\u306f\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u7269\u7406\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3059\u3002RGB LED\u3082\u5099\u3048\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u3084ADC\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3082\u3042\u308a\u30019\u670823\u65e5\u306bCrowd Supply\u3067\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Jumperless V5: \u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aJumperless V5", "Jumperless V5: \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u4f5c\u6210\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eJumperless V5\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u6539\u9020\u3092", "Jumperless V5: \u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046"]}

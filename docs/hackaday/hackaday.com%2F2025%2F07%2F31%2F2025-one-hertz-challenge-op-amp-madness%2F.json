My benchtop function generator can output a sine, square, or saw wave anywhere from 0.01 Hz up to 60 MHz? Way too many choices. At least, thats what we suspect [Phil Weasel] was thinking when he built this Analog 1 Hz Sinewave Generator.\nA KiCad rendering of [Phil]s design[Phil]s AWG (which in this case stands for Anything as long as its a 1 Hz sine\u00a0Wave\u00a0Generator) has another unique feature  its built (almost) entirely with op-amps. A lot of op-amps (37, by our count of the initial schematic he posted). His design is similar to a Phased Locked Loop (PLL) and boils down to a triangle wave oscillator. While a 1 Hz triangle wave would absolutely satisfy judges of the One Hertz Challenge, [Phil] had set out to make a sine wave. Using a feedback loop and some shaping/smoothing tricks (and more op-amps), he rounded off the sharp peaks into a nice smooth sine wave.\nSometimes we make things much more complicated than we need to, just to see if we can. This is one of those times. Are there much simpler ways to generate a sine wave? Yes  but not exclusively using op-amps! This entry brings stiff competition to the Ridiculous category of the 2025 One Hertz Challenge.", "title": "- \u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f1 Hz\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u591a\u304f\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u304c\u3042\u308b\u4e2d\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u306f37\u500b\u306e\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30671Hz\u6b63\u5f26\u6ce2\u767a\u751f\u5668\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f1 Hz\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u8907\u96d1\u306a\u6ce2\u5f62\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b01 Hz\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- 1 Hz\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u3092\u5f62\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- \u300c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u300d\u3088\u308a\u3082\u300c\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\uff01\u300d\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3060\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- 2025\u5e74One Hertz Challenge\u3078\u306e\u53c2\u52a0\uff1a\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u529b\u3067\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u6ce2\u3092\u751f\u6210"]}

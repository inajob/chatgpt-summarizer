But what happens if there is no remote control, and instead a real physical button must be pressed? [What Up TK Here], who regular Hackaday readers might just recognize, had just this problem, and made a remote control button presser.\nIts a 3D printed frame which were told is designed for a specific item, on top of which is mounted a hobby servo. Rotating the servo brings the lever down on the button, and the job is done. At the user end theres a button in a printed enclosure thats definitely not a knock-off of a well-known franchise from a notoriously litigious console company.\nThis is all good, but the interest for other projects lies in how it works. Its using a pair of ESP32 microcontrollers, and instead of connecting to an existing WiFi network its using ESP-NOW for simplicity and low latency. This is a good application for the protocol, but as weve seen,\u00a0its useful for a lot more than just button pressing.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u4e0d\u8981\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u62bc\u3057\u6a5f", "body": "\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u4f5c\u304c\u306a\u304f\u7269\u7406\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002ESP32\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u4f4e\u9045\u5ef6\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u4e0d\u8981\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u62bc\u3057\u6a5f", "- ESP32\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u5e38\u8b58", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u81ea\u4f5c\uff1a\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u62bc\u3057\u88c5\u7f6e", "- ESP-NOW\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u9045\u5ef6\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u6982\u8981", "- \u7269\u7406\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

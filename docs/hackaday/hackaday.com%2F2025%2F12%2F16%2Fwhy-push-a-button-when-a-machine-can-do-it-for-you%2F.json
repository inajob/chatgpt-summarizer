But what happens if there is no remote control, and instead a real physical button must be pressed? [What Up TK Here], who regular Hackaday readers might just recognize, had just this problem, and made a remote control button presser.\nIts a 3D printed frame which were told is designed for a specific item, on top of which is mounted a hobby servo. Rotating the servo brings the lever down on the button, and the job is done. At the user end theres a button in a printed enclosure thats definitely not a knock-off of a well-known franchise from a notoriously litigious console company.\nThis is all good, but the interest for other projects lies in how it works. Its using a pair of ESP32 microcontrollers, and instead of connecting to an existing WiFi network its using ESP-NOW for simplicity and low latency. This is a good application for the protocol, but as weve seen,\u00a0its useful for a lot more than just button pressing.\n\n"}

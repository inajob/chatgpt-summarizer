Yes, Amiga had a life after Commodore, and thats the tl;dr here: Commodore might be back, but it does not own the Amiga IP.\nIf youre wondering who does, youre not the only one. Cloanto now claims the name and most of Amigas IP, though it remains at loggerheads with Hyperion, the distributors of AmigaOS 4. If you havent heard of them, Cloanto is not an elder god, but in fact the group behind Amiga Forever. They have been great stewards of the Amiga heritage over the decades. Any new Amiga is going to need the people at Cloanto on board, one way or another. That doesnt mean its impossible the new Commodore might be able to seduce Cloanto into a merger, or even just a licensing agreement to use the name on reproduction or new hardware.\nWhile a replica C=64 was a no-brainer for the revived Commodore brand, its not quite so clear what they should do with the Amiga name. An FPGA reproduction of the popular A500 or A1200? Would anyone want newly-made 68000-based machines, or to follow Hyperion and MorphOS to now-outdated generations of PowerPC? All of these have been proposed and argued over for years.\nWed love to see something fully new that captures the spirit of the bouncing ball, but its hard to imagine bottling magic like that in the twenty-first century. For now, Amiga lies dreaming but that is not dead which can eternally lie, and we hold out hope this Great Old One can return when the stars are right.\n\n"}

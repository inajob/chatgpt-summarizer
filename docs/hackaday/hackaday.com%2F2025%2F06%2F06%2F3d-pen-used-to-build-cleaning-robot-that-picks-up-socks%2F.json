Theres nothing stopping you replacing the robot and moving around the plastic-squirting nozzle yourself. Thats precisely what [3D Sanago] did to produce this cute little robot.\nThe beginning of the video sets the tone. First we create the base that will become the robot vacuums body, explains [3D Sanago]. I quickly and precisely make a 15 x 15 cm square almost as if I were a 3D printer. Its tedious and tiring to move the 3D printing pen through the motions to build simple parts, but thats the whole gimmick here. Whats wild is how good the results are. With the right post-processing techniques using an iron, [3D Sanago] is able to produce quite attractive plastic parts that almost justify the huge time investment.\nThe robot itself works in a fairly straightforward fashion. Its got four gear motors driving four omniwheels, which let it pan around in all directions with ease. Theyre under command of an Arduino Uno paired with a multi-channel motor driver board. The robot also has a servo-controlled arm for moving small objects. The robot lacks autonomy. Instead, [3D Sanago] gave it a wireless module so it could be commanded with a PS4 controller. Despite being referred to as a robot vacuum, its more of a general cleaning robot since it only has an arm to move objects, with no actual vacuum hardware. Its prime use? Picking up socks.\nWeve seen [3D Sanago]s fine work before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30da\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u6383\u9664\u6a5f", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u624b\u52d5\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002Arduino\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u304c\u3001\u6383\u9664\u6a5f\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u306a\u3057\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30da\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u6383\u9664\u6a5f", "- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- Arduino\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u6383\u9664\u7528\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "- \u6642\u9593\u6295\u8cc7\u306b\u898b\u5408\u3046\u7d50\u679c\uff1a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- PS4\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u6383\u9664\u6a5f"]}

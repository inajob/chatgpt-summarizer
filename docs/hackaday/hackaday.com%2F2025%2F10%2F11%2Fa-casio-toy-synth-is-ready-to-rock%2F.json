In many cases these instruments are underwhelming, having a very small subset of functions based into their black-epoxy-blob microcontrollers.\n[Make Something] found a Casio toy synth that has a few more functions than the average model, and with the addition of some extra effects electronics and a beautifully made case, turned it into an altogether more interesting instrument.\nMost of the video has an element of workshop porn about it, as he makes a very nice Moog-style console case for it, a task made easier by an impressive array of CNC tools. The electronics are slightly more interesting, being a selection of cheap guitar pedals gutted and combined with a cheap tube preamp board. The result is a machine capable of some far more interesting sounds\nWe think many Hackaday readers would be able to repeat these functions from scratch without the pedals, and while the case is a thing of beauty its likely a decent job could be done with a little less finesse on more commonplace tools. Perhaps its worth giving those toy synths a second look, because they really can be had for pennies if you look hard enough. Perhaps its an easier option than a previous toy musical upgrade.\n\n", "title": "- \u304a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092DIY\u3067\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u97f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u304a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092DIY\u3067\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- CNC\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6539\u9020\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u697d\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

In a recent video,[Henrique Ferrolho] demonstrated that this little sensor can also be used to perform a 3D scan of a room. The sensor data can be combined with an IMU to add orientation information to the scan data. These data streams are then combined by an ESP32 MCU that streams the data as JSON to a connected computer.\n\nOf course, thats just the heavily abbreviated version, with the video covering the many implementation details that crop up when implementing the system, including noise filtering, orientation tracking using the IMU and a variety of plane fitting algorithms to consider.\nNote that ST produces a range of these Time-of-Flight sensors that are more basic, such as the VL53VL0X, which is a simple distance meter limited to 2 meters. The VL53L5CX features the multizone array, 4-meter distance range, and 60 Hz sampling speed features that make it significantly more useful for this 3D scanning purpose.\nThe Python-based viewer that runs on the PC can be found on GitHub, along with the ESP32 firmware.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fcSTs VL53L5CX\u306b\u3088\u308b4\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u8ddd\u96e2\u6e2c\u5b9a", "body": "ST\u306eVL53L5CX\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u6700\u59274m\u306e\u8ddd\u96e2\u6e2c\u5b9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u30013D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fcSTs VL53L5CX\u306b\u3088\u308b4\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u8ddd\u96e2\u6e2c\u5b9a", "- 3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bVL53L5CX\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- IMU\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\u3067\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\uff01\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u7d71\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "- GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\uff01Python\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u3068ESP32\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

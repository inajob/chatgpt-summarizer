Even though its usefulness as an everyday port has decreased in the face of much faster competition, its fair to say that everything has a serial port on board somewhere. Even with that ubiquity though, theres still some scope for variation.\nOlder ports and those that are still exposed via a D socket are in most case the so-called RS-232, a higher voltage port, while your microcontroller debug port will be so-called TTL (transistor-transistor logic), operating at logic level. Thats not quite always the case though, as [Terin Stock] found out with an older Garmin GPS unit.\nPleasingly for a three decade old device, given a fresh set of batteries it worked. The time was wrong, but after some fiddling and a Windows 98 machine spun up it applied a Garmin update from 1999 that fixed it. When hooked up to a Flipper Zero though, and after a mild panic about voltage levels, the serial port appeared to deliver garbage. There followed some investigation, with an interesting conclusion that TTL serial is usually the inverse of RS-232 serial, The Garmin had the RS-232 polarity with TTL levels, allowing it to work with many PC serial ports. A quick application of an inverter fixed the problem, and now Garmin and Flipper talk happily.", "title": "\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5909\u9077\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078", "body": "\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4e16\u4ee3\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u666e\u904d\u7684\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002RS-232\u3068TTL\u306f\u901a\u5e38\u306e\u9055\u3044\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001Garmin GPS\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u9006\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u554f\u984c\u306f\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a\u3055\u308c\u3001Garmin\u3068Flipper\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u304c\u6b63\u5e38\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5909\u9077\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078", "RS-232\u3068TTL\uff1a\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7a2e\u985e", "Garmin GPS\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1aRS-232\u306e\u6975\u6027\u306bTTL\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b", "\u53e4\u3044Garmin GPS\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u547d\u3092\u5439\u304d\u8fbc\u3080", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304a\u3088\u3073\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u96fb\u5727\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u8abf\u6574"]}

Its a highly flammable gas that seems way too cool to be easy to come by. And yet, its actually trivial to make it out of water if you know how. [Maciej Nowak] has shown us how to do just that with his latest build.\nThe project in question is a simple hydrogen generator that relies on the electrolysis of water. Long story short, run a current through water and you can split H2O molecules up and make H2 and O2 molecules instead. From water, you get both hydrogen to burn and the oxygen to burn it in! Even better, when you\u00a0do burn the hydrogen, it combines with the oxygen to make water again! Its all too perfect.\nThis particular hydrogen generator uses a series of acrylic tanks. Each is fitted with electrodes assembled from threaded rods to pass current through water. The tops of the tanks have barbed fittings which allow the gas produced to be plumbed off to another storage vessel for later use. The video shows us the construction of the generator, but we also get to see it in action\u2014both in terms of generating gas from the water, and that gas later being used in some fun combustion experiments.\nPedants will point out this isnt really just a hydrogen generator, because its generating oxygen too. Either way, its still cool. Weve featured a few similar builds before as well.\n\n"}

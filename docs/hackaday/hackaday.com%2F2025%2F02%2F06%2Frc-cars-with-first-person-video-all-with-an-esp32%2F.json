[Mattsroufe] has made a very cool project with one of them, not only managing to stream video from a small model car, but also to control the steering and motor by means of servos and a little motor driver.\nSadly its not entirely a stand-alone device, as the ESP32 streams video to a web server with some Python code to handle the controls. The server can aggregate several of them on one page though, for perhaps a little real-life quad-screen Mario Kart action if you have enough of the things. We can see that this idea has plenty of potential beyond the mere fun of driving a toy car around though, but to whet your appetite theres a demo video below.\nWeve seen enough of the ESP32-cam before, but perhaps more as a photographic device.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32-CAM\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u7e26", "body": "ESP32-CAM\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8eca\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u914d\u4fe1\u30fb\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32-CAM\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u64cd\u7e26", "- Python\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308bESP32-CAM\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eESP32-CAM\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- ESP32-CAM\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u52d5\u753b\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- \u8907\u6570\u306eESP32-CAM\u3092\u9023\u643a\u3055\u305b\u3066\u904a\u3076\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u98a8\u4f53\u9a13"]}

[Carl]s version is about the size of a baseball and crams nearly a thousand RGB pixels across the surface.\nA four-layer flexible PCB is the key to routing data and power to so many LEDs.\nPutting that many addressable LEDs  even tiny 1 mm x 1 mm ones  across a rounded surface isnt exactly trivial. [Carl]s favored approach ended up relying on a flexible four-layer PCB and using clever design and math to lay out an unusual panel shape which covers a small 3D printed geodesic dome.\nMuch easier said that done, by the way. All kinds of things can and do go wrong, from an un-fixable short in the first version to adhesive and durability issues in later prototypes. In the end, however, its a success. Powered over USB-C, his mini sphere can display a variety of patterns and reactive emojis.\nAs elegant and impressive as the engineering is in this dense little display, [Carl] has some mixed feelings about the results. 945 individual pixels on such a small object is a lot, but it also ends up being fairly low-resolution in the end. It isnt very good at displaying sharp lines or borders, so any familiar shapes (like circles or eyes) come out kind of ragged. Its also expensive. The tiny LEDs may be only about 5 cents each, but when one needs nearly a thousand of them for one prototype that adds up quickly. The whole bill of materials comes out to roughly $250 USD after adding up the components, PCB, controller, and mechanical parts. Its certainly a wildly different build than its distant cousin, the RGB cube.\nStill, its an awfully slick little build. [Carl] doubts theres much value in pursuing the idea further, but there are plenty of great images and clips from the build. Check out the video, embedded below.\n\n"}

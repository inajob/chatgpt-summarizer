Were talking of course about the tuning knob, because it represents possibly the most intuitive way to move across the bands. Never fear though, because [mircemk] has a solution. Hes converted a mouse into a tuning dial.\nThe scroll wheel on a mouse is nothing more than a rotary encoder, and can easily be used as a sort of tuning knob. Replacing it with a better encoder gives it a much better feel, so thats what hes done. An enclosure has the guts of a mouse, with the front-mounted encoder wired into where the scroll wheel would have been. The result, for a relatively small amount of work, is a tuning knob, and a peripheral were guessing could also have a lot of uses beyond software defined radio.\nIts not the first knob weve seen, for that you might want to start with the wonderfully named Tiny Knob, but its quite possibly one of the simplest to build. We like it.", "title": "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u7121\u9650\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3064\u307e\u307f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001[mircemk]\u306f\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3057\u3066\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5\u3092\u793a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b", "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u6539\u5584", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\uff1a\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b"]}

Usually, getting your weather forecast from a snarky, malicious AI potato isnt one of them, unless youre a huge Portal fan like [Binh Pham].\n[Binh Pham] built the potato incarnation of GLaDOS from the Portal 2 video game with the help of a ReSpeaker Light kit, an ESP32-based board designed for speech recognition and voice control, and as an interface for home assistant running on a Raspberry Pi.\nHe resisted the temptation to use a real potato as an enclosure and wisely opted instead to print one from a 3D file he found on Thingiverse of the original GLaDOS potato. Providing the assistant with the iconic synthetic voice of GLaDOS was a matter of repackaging an existing voice model for use with Home Assistant.\nOf course all of this attention to detail would be for not if you had to refer to the assistant as Google or Alexa to get its attention. A bit of custom modelling and on-device wake word detection, and the cyborg tuber was ready to switch lights on and off with its signature sinister wit.\nWeve seen a number of projects that brought Portal objects to life for fans of the franchise to enjoy, even an assistant based on another version of the GLaDOS the character. This one adds a dimension of absurdity to the collection.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc: GLaDOS\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u304c\u8a95\u751f\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb2\u306eGLaDOS\u98a8\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc: GLaDOS\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u304c\u8a95\u751f\uff01\u300d", "- \u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u52a9\u624b\u300d", "- \u300c\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cGLaDOS\u30dd\u30c6\u30c8\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300cESP32\u3068Raspberry Pi\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300c\u60aa\u5f79AI\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d"]}

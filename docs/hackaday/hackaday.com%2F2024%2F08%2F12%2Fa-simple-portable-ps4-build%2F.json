You have to do lots of wiring, maybe trim a few PCBs, and learn all about the finer points of high-end motherboard design! Or, you could keep it simple. Thats just what [Francesco6n] did when he built this portable PS4.\nThe aim for this build wasnt to build the smallest, sleekest, or prettiest portable PS4. It was just to build a functional one that worked. To that end, the guts of the PS4 was installed in a 3D-printed case decorated with the usual square-circle-cross-triangle motif. A 1024600 Acer Aspire One laptop display was installed in a clamshell configuration to act as the screen for the build. Inside the case is a large GPU-style cooler which helps keep temperatures down. As for power, theres no need to plug this thing in everywhere you go. Instead, its capable of running for up to 90 minutes continuously thanks to a battery pack consisting of eighteen 18650 cells. In a beautiful touch of cross-platform cooperation, an Xbox 360 supply is used to power the thing when mains power is available.\nIts a neat build, and one that doesnt overcomplicate things. Projects like this are a great way to get your feet wet with portable console hacking, letting you learn the ropes without too much pressure. More pictures after the break.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Francesco Tempra (@francesco6n)\n\n\n", "title": "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebPS4\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "body": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001[Francesco6n]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306aPS4\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u308418650\u30bb\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Xbox 360\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebPS4\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "PS4\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u7d0d\u3059\u308b", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u7528\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "Xbox 360\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fPS4\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb", "\u8da3\u5411\u3092\u51dd\u3089\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebPS4"]}

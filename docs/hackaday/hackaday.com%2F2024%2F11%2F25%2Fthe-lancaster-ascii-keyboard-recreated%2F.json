In the 1970s, if you wanted a terminal, you might well have built a [Don Lancaster] TV Typewriter and the companion low cost keyboard. [Artem Kalinchuk] wanted to recreate this historic keyboard and, you know what? He did! Take a look at the video below.\nThe first task was to create a PCB from the old artwork from Radio Electronics magazine. [Artem] did the hard work but discovered that the original board expected a very specific kind of key. So, he created a variant that takes modern MX keyboard switches, which is nice. He does sell the PCBs, but you can also find the design files on GitHub.\n\nNot only were the TV typewriters and related projects popular, but they also inspired many similar projects and products from early computer companies.\nThe board is really just a holder for keys, some jumper wires, and an edge connector. You still need an ASCII encoder board, which [Artem] also recreates. That board is simple, using diodes, a few transistors, and a small number of simple ICs.\nIf you werent there, part of installing old software was writing the code needed to read and write to your terminal. No kidding. We miss [Don Lancaster]. We wonder how many TV typewriters were built, especially if you include modern recreations.\n"}

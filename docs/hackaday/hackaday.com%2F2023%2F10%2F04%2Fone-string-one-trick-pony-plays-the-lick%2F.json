Thats the idea behind Strumli, a single-string instrument built by [Factorem] that plays the lick. You know, the lick. Chances are, youve heard it somewhere before.\nEssentially, its a pill-shaped bowl with a soundboard. A high-E guitar string is wound around bearings and tuned with a guitar tuner. The lengths of string between the bearings correspond to each note in the lick. Strum it in the right direction, and Bobs your uncle.\nSo how the heck did [Factorem] come up with the proper string lengths needed to play the song? After a bit of fancy math involving the equation that represents the relationship between the measurable frequency of a vibrating string under tension and the tension itself, [Factorem] had the overall length of the string. Then it was a matter of finding the frequencies needed to play the lick, along with their corresponding lengths.\nSince the string exerts about 80 pounds of tension across the 3D-printed soundboard, some serious internal bracing is required, which [Factorem] figured out in CAD program. All the files are available if you want to build your own. Be sure to check out the build/demo after the break.\nWould you rather just build a little harp? Heres the inspiration for Strumli  a single-string number with a full octave.\n\n"}

Indeed, the Tinytron from [t0mg] is a neat little tchotchke in this vein  a miniature TV that you could just about fit on a keyring.\n[t0mg] wanted this project to be quick and easy to put together. It starts with an ESP32-S3-LCD-1.69 from Waveshare. Its an all-in-one dev module which combines the microcontroller with a small screen right out of the box. You just have to solder a single six pin header to hook it up with an SD card reader and battery, and youre done with the electronics. Even the case is a cinch to build, with four 3D printed components that can be spat out of a Prusa MK4S in just half an hour. Programming it can be done via a web browser. Just about the only thing its missing is a speaker  this TV is video only.\nTo watch things on the Tinytron, you just have to prepare them properly and drop them on the SD card. [t0mg] provides a web page for transcoding the video files, although you can do it yourself locally with ffmpeg if you prefer.\nIf youre looking for a silly gift for a TV-obsessed friend, you could probably whip up a Tinytron in a couple hours or less. It reminds us of another great project, the tiny Simpsons replica TV that endlessly plays the greatest cartoon on Earth.\n\n", "title": "- \u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2TV\u300cTinytron\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "Tinytron\u306f\u3001ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3067\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2TV\u300cTinytron\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Tinytron\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u597d\u304d\u3078\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

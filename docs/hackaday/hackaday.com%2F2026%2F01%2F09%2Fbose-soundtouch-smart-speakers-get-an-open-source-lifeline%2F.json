Rather than the complete shutdown and cut-off that we reported on previously, Bose will now remove cloud support as its servers shut down, but the SoundTouch mobile app will get an update that gets truncated to just the local support functions. Bose also made the SoundTouch Web API documentation available as a PDF document.\nThe shutdown date has also been extended from the original February 18 to May 6th of this year. Although these changes mean that the mobile app can no longer use music services, features like grouping speakers and controlling playback will keep working. Features such as presets which were cloud-based will naturally stop working.\nWith the web API documentation made public it remains to be seen how helpful this will be. From a quick glance at the PDF documentation it appears to be a typical REST API, using HTTP on port 8090 on the SoundTouch device, with an SGML-style tag system to format messages. In so far as the community hasnt already reverse-engineered this API its at least nice to have official documentation.", "title": "\u30dc\u30fc\u30ba\u3001SoundTouch\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u3092\u5ef6\u671f\u3057\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u59a5\u5354\u6848\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "Bose\u306fSoundTouch\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4e00\u90e8\u7dad\u6301\u3057\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u65e5\u3082\u5ef6\u9577\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dc\u30fc\u30ba\u3001SoundTouch\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u3092\u5ef6\u671f\u3057\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u59a5\u5354\u6848\u3092\u767a\u8868", "SoundTouch\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u7d42\u4e86", "\u30dc\u30fc\u30ba\u3001SoundTouch Web API\u306ePDF\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u516c\u958b", "\u97f3\u697d\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u3001\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u5316\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u7dad\u6301", "\u30dc\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u524d\u5012\u3057\u306eShutdown\u30925\u67086\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u5ef6\u9577"]}

Making a good chocolate chip cookie is a little harder. Making a good chocolate chip cookie quickly is a pretty tall order, but if you cobble together a microwave and a conventional oven, you just might get delicious and fast to get together.\nThe goal of this Frankenstein-esque project is to build a vending machine that can whip up a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie on demand and make [Chaz] wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Were guessing at that last part; for all we know his goal is world peace through instant cookies. Were fine with the idea either way, and his previous work on the project resulted in a semi-automatic cookie gun to splooge the dough out in suitable dollops.\nThe current work is turning those into something edible, for which a microwave seems a logical choice. Experience tells us otherwise, so off to the thrift store went [Chaz], returning with a used air fryer. He ripped the guts out of a small microwave, slapped the magnetron onto the side of the air fryer, and discovered that this was officially A Bad Idea via a microwave leakage tester. Round 2 went the other way  adding a conventional heating element to a large microwave. That worked much better, especially after close-up video revealed the dynamics of microwave cookery and the best way to combine the two cooking modalities. The result is a contraption that makes a pretty tasty-looking two-minute cookie. World peace, here we come!\nOf course theres plenty to say about the safety of all this, much of which [Chaz] himself cops to in the video. Its important to remember that hes just prototyping here; were sure the final machine will be a little more sophisticated than a heat gun duct-taped to the side of a microwave. Those cookies arent going to bake themselves, though, so youve got to start somewhere.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5373\u5e2d\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc", "body": "\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u65e9\u304f\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304f\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u81ea\u52d5\u8ca9\u58f2\u6a5f\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u4e2d\u306b\u306f\u5371\u967a\u3082\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9032\u3081\u308b\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u4e16\u754c\u5e73\u548c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059This Frankenstein-esque project\u3092\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5373\u5e2d\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u713c\u304d\u83d3\u5b50\u81ea\u8ca9\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3068\u5f93\u6765\u578b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u5373\u5e2d\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u88fd\u9020", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u4e16\u754c\u5e73\u548c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9032\u3081\u308b\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u767a"]}

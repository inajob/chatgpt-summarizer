Making a good chocolate chip cookie is a little harder. Making a good chocolate chip cookie quickly is a pretty tall order, but if you cobble together a microwave and a conventional oven, you just might get delicious and fast to get together.\nThe goal of this Frankenstein-esque project is to build a vending machine that can whip up a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie on demand and make [Chaz] wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Were guessing at that last part; for all we know his goal is world peace through instant cookies. Were fine with the idea either way, and his previous work on the project resulted in a semi-automatic cookie gun to splooge the dough out in suitable dollops.\nThe current work is turning those into something edible, for which a microwave seems a logical choice. Experience tells us otherwise, so off to the thrift store went [Chaz], returning with a used air fryer. He ripped the guts out of a small microwave, slapped the magnetron onto the side of the air fryer, and discovered that this was officially A Bad Idea via a microwave leakage tester. Round 2 went the other way  adding a conventional heating element to a large microwave. That worked much better, especially after close-up video revealed the dynamics of microwave cookery and the best way to combine the two cooking modalities. The result is a contraption that makes a pretty tasty-looking two-minute cookie. World peace, here we come!\nOf course theres plenty to say about the safety of all this, much of which [Chaz] himself cops to in the video. Its important to remember that hes just prototyping here; were sure the final machine will be a little more sophisticated than a heat gun duct-taped to the side of a microwave. Those cookies arent going to bake themselves, though, so youve got to start somewhere.\n\n"}

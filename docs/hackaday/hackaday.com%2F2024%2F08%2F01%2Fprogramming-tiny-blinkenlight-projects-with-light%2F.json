While most of us would probably solve the problem of having no physical space on a board to mount a connector with WiFi or Bluetooth, he took a different path and gave this clever light-based programming interface a go.\nPart of the impetus for this approach comes from some of the LED-centric projects [mitxela] has tackled lately, particularly wearables such as his LED matrix earrings or these blinky industrial piercings. Since LEDs can serve as light sensors, albeit imperfect ones, he explored exactly how to make the scheme work.\nFor initial experiments he wisely chose his larger but still diminutive LED matrix badge, which sports a CH32V003 microcontroller, an 88 array of SMD LEDs, and not much else. The video below is a brief summary of the effort, while the link above provides a much more detailed account of the proceedings, which involved a couple of false starts and a lot of prototyping that eventually led to dividing the matrix in two and ganging all the LEDs in each half into separate sensors. This allows [mitxela] to connect each side of the array to the two inputs of an op-amp built into the CH32V003, making a differential sensor thats less prone to interference from room light. A smartphone app alternately flashes two rectangles on and off with the matrix lying directly on the screen to send data to the badge  at a low bitrate, to be sure, but its more than enough to program the badge in a reasonable amount of time.\nWe find this to be an extremely clever way to leverage whats already available and make a project even better than it was. Heres hoping it spurs new and even smaller LED projects in the future.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5149\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001[mitxela]\u6c0f\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5149\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002LED\u3092\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5149\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "LED\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5", "LED\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u7c21\u6613\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0", "CH32V003\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3068LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u4f4e\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0"]}

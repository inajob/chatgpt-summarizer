[Greg Zumwalt] nailed it with his Marblevator Line Follower. Roboticists will immediately recognize a black line on a white surface, but this uses hidden mechanics instead of light/dark sensors. Check out the video after the break to see the secrets, or keep\u00a0bearing\u00a0with us.\nInside the cylinder is a battery, charging circuit, inductive receiving coil, and a motor turning a magnet-laden arm beneath the cap. The overall effect is an illusion to convince people that the marble has a mind of its own. You can pick up the cylinder, and it keeps moving as expected from an autonomous bot. The black line is actually a groove, so the bearing follows a curvy course without any extra movements from the magnets within. The two-tone look is super-clean, but the whimsy of a smart bearing makes this an all-around\u00a0winner.\nMarblevator Line Follower is not the first Marblevator we featured, and we love our bouncing-bearing baubles and music-making machines.\n\n\n"}

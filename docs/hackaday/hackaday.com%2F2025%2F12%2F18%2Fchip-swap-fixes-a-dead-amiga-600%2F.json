Sure it had a PCMCIA slot nobody used, and an IDE interface for a laptop hard drive, but it served only to really annoy anyone whod bought one when a few months later the higher-spec 1200 appeared. Its had a rehabilitation in recent years though as a retrocomputer, and [LinuxJedi] has a 600 motherboard in need of some attention.\nAs expected for a machine of its age it can use replacement electrolytic capacitors, and its reset capacitor had bitten the dust. But theres more to that with one of these machines, as capacitor leakage can damage the filter circuitry surrounding its video encoder chip. Since both video and audio flow through this circuit, there was no composite video to be seen.\nThe hack comes in removing the original chip rather than attempt the difficult task of replacing the filter, and replacing it with a different Sony chip in the same series. Its nicely done with a connector in the original footprint, and a small daughterboard. The A600 lives again, but this time it wont be a disappointment to anyone.\nIf you want to wallow in some Amiga history as well as read a rant about what went wrong, we have you covered.", "title": "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac600\u306f\u3001\u52a3\u60aa\u306a\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u307e\u307e\u767b\u5834\u3057\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u65bd\u3055\u308c\u3001\u671f\u5f85\u306b\u5fdc\u3048\u308b\u5b58\u5728\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "\u96fb\u89e3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b", "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6539\u826f\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30a2\u30df\u30ac600\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6559\u8a13\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

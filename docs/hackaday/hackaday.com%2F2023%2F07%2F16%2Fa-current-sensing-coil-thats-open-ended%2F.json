So it is with the Rogowski coil, an AC current sensing coil which is unlike conventional current transformers in that its open ended  in other words not needing to be closed around the conductor its measuring. [Weston Braun] has an interesting introduction to the subject, as part of his open source Rogowski coil based current probe.\nThe project itself is an amplifier and integrator that provides a voltage output proportional to the current sensed by the coil, but the real meat is in discovering the coils themselves. Theyre a many-turn coil wound on a flexible former, forming in effect a toroidal inductor with a gap in it when bent into a circle. Theyre for high frequencies only though, with the one in this project having a bandwidth from 888 Hz to 25 MHz. We dont have any immediate need to non-intrusively measure current at those frequencies, but its something to know that we could.\nThis isnt the first time a Rogowski coil has turned up on Hackaday though, back in 2011 we saw one used to measure a steep current impulse.", "title": "\"\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u306eRogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\"", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u6d3e\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u304c\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eRogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u5c02\u7528\u3067\u3001\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u96fb\u6d41\u6e2c\u5b9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4ee5\u524d\u3082Hackaday\u3067\u63a1\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u306eRogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\"", "\"Rogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u96fb\u6d41\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\"", "\"Rogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u6d41\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\"", "\"Rogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u7528\u9014\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308d\u3046\"", "\"\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u96fb\u6d41\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bRogowski\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u5fdc\u7528\""]}

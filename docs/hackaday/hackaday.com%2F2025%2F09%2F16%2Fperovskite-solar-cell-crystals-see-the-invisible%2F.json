Researchers at Northwestern University and Soochow University have built the first perovskite-based gamma-ray detector that actually works for nuclear medicine imaging, like SPECT scans. This hack is unusual because it takes a once-experimental lab material and shows it can replace multimillion-dollar detectors in real-world hospitals.\nCurrent medical scanners rely on CZT or NaI detectors. CZT is pricey and cracks like ice on a frozen lake. NaI is cheaper, but fuzzy  like photographing a cat through steamed-up glass. Perovskites, however, are easier to grow, cheaper to process, and now proven to detect single photons with record-breaking precision. The team pixelated their crystal like a smartphone camera sensor and pulled crisp 3D images out of faint radiation traces. The payoff: sharper scans, lower radiation doses, and tech that could spread beyond rich clinics.\nPerovskite was once typecast as a \u2018solar cell wonder,\u2019 but now it\u2019s mutating into a disruptive medical eye. A hack in the truest sense: re-purposing physics for life-saving clarity.", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u4eba\u4f53\u306e\u300c\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u300d\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u304c\u533b\u7642\u7528\u753b\u50cf\u306b\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u4eba\u4f53\u306e\u300c\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u300d\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u533b\u7642\u7528\u753b\u50cf\u691c\u67fb\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u533b\u7642\u73fe\u5834\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u3001\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7528\u9014"]}

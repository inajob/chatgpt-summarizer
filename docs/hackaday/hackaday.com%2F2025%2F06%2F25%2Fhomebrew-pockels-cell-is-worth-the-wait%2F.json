Turns out we neednt have fretted, as [Les] was deep into this exploration of the Pockels Effect, with pretty cool results.\nIf youll recall, [Les]s last appearance on these pages concerned the automated creation of huge, perfect crystals of KDP, or potassium dihydrogen phosphate. KDP crystals have many interesting properties, but the focus here is on their ability to modulate light when an electrical charge is applied to the crystal. Thats the Pockels Effect, and while there are commercially available Pockels cells available for use mainly as optical switches, wheres the sport in buying when you can build?\nAs with most of [Les]s projects, there are hacks galore here, but the hackiest is probably the homemade diamond wire saw. The fragile KDP crystals need to be cut before use, and rather than risk his beauties to a bandsaw or angle grinder, [Les] threw together a rig using a stepper motor and some cheap diamond-encrusted wire. The motor moves the diamond wire up and down while a weight forces the crystal against it on a moving sled. Brilliant!\nThe cut crystals are then polished before being mounted between conductive ITO glass and connected to a high-voltage supply. The video below shows the beautiful polarization changes induced by the electric field, as well as demonstrating how well the Pockels cell acts as an optical switch. Its kind of neat to see a clear crystal completely block a laser just by flipping a switch.\nNice work, [Les], and great to have you back.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u3067KDP\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u5207\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Les Wright\u304cPockels\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001KDP\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u5207\u65ad\u30fb\u52a0\u5de5\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30bd\u30fc\u3067KDP\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u5207\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30dd\u30c3\u30b1\u30eb\u30b9\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u63a2\u6c42\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u5149\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b", "- KDP\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5149\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30b9\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u6c0f\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u5149\u5b66\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u4f9b\u7d66\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bKDP\u7d50\u6676\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u504f\u5149\u5909\u5316"]}

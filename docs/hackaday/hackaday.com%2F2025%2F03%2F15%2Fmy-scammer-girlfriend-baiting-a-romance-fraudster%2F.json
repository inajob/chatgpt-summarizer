Case in point, [Ben Tasker] recently got a few romance scam emails that made him decide to take a poke at the scam behind these messages. This particular scam tries to draw in marks with an attached photo (pilfered from Facebook) and fake personal details. Naturally, contacting scammers is a bad idea, and you should never provide them with any personal information if you decide to have some fun.\nThe games begin once you contact them via the listed email address, as theyre all sent from hacked/spoofed email accounts. After this you have to wait for the scammers to return to the campaign on their monthly cycle, so give it a few weeks.\u00a0Analyzing image metadata provides some clues (e.g. the FBMD prefix in IPTC tags set by Meta, as well as timezone info). The IP address from the email headers pointed to a VPN being used, so no easy solution here.\nAfter establishing contact, the scammers try to coax the mark into helping them move to their country, with Skype out-call numbers received on [Ben]s burner phone that seem designed to add to the realism. Then disaster strikes and the mark is asked to transfer a lot of money to help their new love. Naturally, [Ben] wasnt a gullible mark, and set up a few traps, including a custom domain and website thatd log any visitor (i.e. the scammer).\n\nThe scammer happily clicked the link and thus the browser language (Russian) was determined while confirming the UTC+3 timezone from the image metadata. Even more devious was inflicting Cloudflares much-maligned Turnstile feature that is supposed to protect websites from bots and such. This did however mostly confirm what the more basic Javascript had sussed out previously. Pinning down the location of the scammers was proving to be rather hard.\nThe breakthrough came when following a similar scam email that came in, with the scammers having seemingly forgotten to turn on their VPN, as this time the email headers pointed to an IP address of a Russian ISP.\nUltimately this sleuthing mostly reveals the depressing truth about these scams, in that the scammers will readily make up sob stories and pilfer peoples images from social media, all to find a few susceptible marks within the probably thousands if not millions who get sent these scam mails. The crude sophistry displayed in [Ben]s article when it comes to photoshopping visas, passports, etc. tends to be still enough to convince those who want to believe that their soulmate just messaged them out of the blue.\nAs much as wed like there to be a technological solution to scams, this is one area where only careful human programming can help, and thus why educating everyone on the hazards of the Internet is so essential."}

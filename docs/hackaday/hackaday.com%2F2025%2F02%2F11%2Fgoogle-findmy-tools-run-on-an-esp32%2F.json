[Leon B\u00f6ttger] released his re-implementation of the Android tracker network: GoogleFindMyTools. Most interestingly for us, there is example code to turn an ESP32 into a trackable object. Let the games begin!\nEverything is in its first stages here, and not everything has been implemented yet, but you are able to query devices for their keys, and use this to decrypt their latest location beacons, which is the main use case.\nThe ESP32 code appears not to support MAC address randomization just yet, so its possibly more trackable than it should be, but if youre just experimenting with the system, this shouldnt be too much of a problem. The README also notes that you might need to re-register after three days of use. We havent gotten to play with it just yet. Have you?\nIf youre worried about the privacy implications of yet another ubiquitous tracking system out there, youre not alone. Indeed, [Leon] was one of the people working on the Air Guard project, which let iPhone users detect trackers of all sorts around them. Anyone know if theres something like that for Android?\nThanks [Lars] for the hot tip!\n", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fGoogle\u306eFind My\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "Google\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u300cFind My\u300d\u306bESP32\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fGoogle\u306eFind My\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "- GoogleFindMyTools\u3067\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- Android\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u5b9f\u88c5\uff1aESP32\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b69", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u61f8\u5ff5\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "- ESP32\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u3068\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

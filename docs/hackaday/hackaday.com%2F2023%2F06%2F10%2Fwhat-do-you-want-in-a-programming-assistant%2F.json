If you dont know it, the lyrics include: They say the next big thing is here. That the revolutions near. But to me, it seems quite clear. That its all just a little bit of history repeating. The next big thing today seems to be the AI chatbots. Weve heard every opinion from the revolutionize everything to destroy everything camp. But, really, isnt it a bit of history repeating itself? We get new tech. Some oversell it. Some fear it. Then, in the end, it becomes part of the ordinary landscape and seems unremarkable in the light of the new next big thing. Dynamite, the steam engine, cars, TV, and the Internet were all predicted to ruin everything at some point in the past.\nHistory really does repeat itself. After all, when X-rays were discovered, they were claimed to cure pneumonia and other infections, along with other miracle cures. Those didnt pan out, but we still use them for things they are good at. Calculators were going to ruin math classes. There are plenty of other examples.\nThis came to mind because a recent post from ACM has the contrary view that chatbots arent able to help real programmers. Weve also seen that  maybe  it can, in limited ways. We suspect it is like getting a new larger monitor. At first, it seems huge. But in a week, it is just the normal monitor, and your old one  which had been perfectly adequate  seems tiny.\nBut we think theres a larger point here. Maybe the chatbots will help programmers. Maybe they wont. But clearly, programmers want some kind of help. We just arent sure what kind of help it is. Do we really want CoPilot to write our code for us? Do we want to ask Bard or ChatGPT/Bing what is the best way to balance a B-tree? Asking AI to do static code analysis seems to work pretty well.\nSo maybe your path to fame and maybe even riches is to figure out  AI-based or not  what people actually want in an automated programming assistant and build that. The home computer idea languished until someone figured out what people wanted to do with them. Video cassette didnt make it into the home until companies figured out what people wanted most to watch on them.\nHow much and what kind of help do you want when you program? Or design a circuit or PCB? Or even a 3D model? Maybe AI isnt going to take your job; it will just make it easier. We doubt, though, that it can much improve on Dame Shirley Basseys history lesson.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

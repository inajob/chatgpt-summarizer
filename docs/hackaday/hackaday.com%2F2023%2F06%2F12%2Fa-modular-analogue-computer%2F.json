But the same techniques are just as useful wherever else analogue circuits need to be configured on the fly, such as in an analogue computer. Its something [Rainer Glaschick] has pursued, with his Flexible Analog Computer, an analogue computer made from a set of modules mounted on breadboard strips.\nStandard modules are an adder and an integrator, with the adder also having inverter, comparator, and precision rectifier functions. The various functions can be easily configured by means of jumpers, and there are digital switches on board to enable or disable outputs and inputs. hes set up a moon landing example to demonstrate the machine in practice.\nWere not going to pretend to be analogue computer experts here at Hackaday,but we naturally welcome any foray into analogue circuitry lest it become a lost art. If youd like to experiment with analogue computing there are other projects out there to whet your appetite, and of course they dont even need to be electronic."}

The concept is not a new one, with the type of construction being seen a few times here and there. In addition to the usual three directions of motion, were familiar with, with the cartesian bot design, these types of machines add an additional two rotation axes, one which can swing the build platform front and back around the X-axis, and a second that provides rotation around the Z-axis. These combined motions give rise to some very interesting capabilities, outside of our familiar 3D printing design constraints.\nAs for the generative side of things, this is a largely theoretical idea. Essentially the concept is that the machines design can be iteratively updated and optimised for performance to fit into the constraints of available hardware such as motors and other vitamins needed to create the next generation of machines. The design files should be parameterised enough such that this optimisation process can be automated, potentially via input from AI, but we suspect were a way off from that yet. Whether this project as yet satisfies any of these lofty goals remains to be seen, but do keep an eye on it if youre so inclined. There is a Fusion 360 project here to dig into, but if youre not interested in the research side of the project, but just want to build a 5-axis machine to play with, then you can find the project source on the GitHub Page.\nIf this feels familiar, youd be on the right track, as we covered at least one other 5D printer recently. We have also touched upon generative design at least once. Were sure we will see more on this topic in the future.\n\n\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "2023 Hackaday Prize\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308bGen5X\u3068\u3044\u30465\u8ef83D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "[Ric Real]\u3055\u3093\u304cGen5X\u3068\u3044\u30465\u8ef83D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u30012023\u5e74\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306f\u4ee5\u524d\u306b\u3082\u898b\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e2\u3064\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u8ef8\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u80fd\u529b\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u306b\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306b\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u9032\u5c55\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["2023 Hackaday Prize\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3059\u308bGen5X\u3068\u3044\u30465\u8ef83D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30e9\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f5\u8ef83D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcGen5X\u306e\u958b\u767a", "5\u8ef8\u52d5\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcGen5X\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306eHackaday Prize\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308bGen5X\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u8a73\u7d30", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u6d3e\u5fc5\u898b\uff015\u8ef83D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fcGen5X\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304cGitHub\u306b\u516c\u958b"]}

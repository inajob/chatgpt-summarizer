Perhaps a more curated digital catalog of projects would help?\nFeaturing 1000 Useful Things to Make, [NODE]s Make it Yourself is a beautifully-illustrated catalog of open source and DIY projects spanning a number of domains including camping gear, furniture, music, and maker tools. Each image is a link to the original project and theres a handy icon by each denoting what skills are needed, such as sewing or 3D printing.\nIf you havent seen [NODE]s work before, he uses line art to illustrate his projects and has given all of these projects the same treatment on the (virtual) page with credits to the original creators in the footnotes. We hope a future edition will include tractors and houses to truly rival the Sears catalog of yore, but its hard to complain when we already have so many projects we could choose to build.\nMany of the projects may seem familiar, if slightly fancier when illustrated in line art, like the Ploopy headphones, this retro audio player, or the Keybon adaptive macro pad.\n\n"}

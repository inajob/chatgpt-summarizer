[via LinkedIn]\nFiber optic lines, electrical transmission capacity, and the data centers themselves are all here. Each data center is a dot with its size indicating how power hungry it is and its approximate location relative to nearby metropolitan areas. Color coding of these dots also helps us understand if the data center is already in operation (yellow), under construction (orange), or proposed (white).\nAlso of interest to renewable energy nerds would be the presence of some high voltage DC transmission lines on the map which may be the future of electrical transmission. As the exact location of fiber optic lines and other data making up the map are either proprietary, sensitive, or both, the map is only available as a static image.\nIf youre itching to learn more about maps, how about exploring why they dont quite match reality, how to bring OpenStreetMap data into Minecraft, or see how the live map in a 1960s airliner worked.", "title": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u3092\u793a\u3059\u8a73\u7d30\u30de\u30c3\u30d7", "body": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306e\u5730\u56f3\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u8981\u3084\u5efa\u8a2d\u72b6\u6cc1\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u3092\u793a\u3059\u8a73\u7d30\u30de\u30c3\u30d7", "\u96fb\u529b\u9700\u8981\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5730\u56f3", "\u9ad8\u5727\u76f4\u6d41\u9001\u96fb\u7dda\u306e\u5c06\u6765\u6027\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u6280\u8853\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u30ba\u30ec\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "Minecraft\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080OpenStreetMap\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

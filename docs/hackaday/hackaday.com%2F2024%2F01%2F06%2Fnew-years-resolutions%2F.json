More exercise, being nicer to your neighbors, consuming more or less of this or that, depending on whether it\u2019s healthy or un. Those are the standard fare. But what\u2019s your hacker new year\u2019s resolution?\nMine, this year, is to branch out into a new microcontroller family, to learn a new toolchain, and maybe to finally dip my toes into Bluetooth Low Energy. Although that last one is admittedly a stretch.\nBut the former is great resolution material, if you allow me.

It\u2019s the perfect setup for a resolution! What\u2019s yours?\n(And yes, the art is from another story, but setting up a good backup regime isnt a bad resolution either.)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

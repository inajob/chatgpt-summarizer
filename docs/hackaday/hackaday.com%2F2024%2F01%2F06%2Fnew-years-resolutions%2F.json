More exercise, being nicer to your neighbors, consuming more or less of this or that, depending on whether it\u2019s healthy or un. Those are the standard fare. But what\u2019s your hacker new year\u2019s resolution?\nMine, this year, is to branch out into a new microcontroller family, to learn a new toolchain, and maybe to finally dip my toes into Bluetooth Low Energy. Although that last one is admittedly a stretch.\nBut the former is great resolution material, if you allow me. New programming tooling is always a little unpleasant to set up, but there\u2019s also payoff at the end of the ordeal. It\u2019s a lot like picking up a new exercise \u2013 it makes you stronger. Or course, it helps to have an application in mind, the equivalent of that suit you want to be able to fit into at the end of the diet. I\u2019ve got one. I\u2019ve also been out of programming in straight C for a year or so, and I\u2019m faced with a new HAL, so there\u2019s bound to be enough of a challenge to make it worthwhile.\nHonestly, I\u2019m looking forward to getting started, but with the usual mix of optimism, over-optimism, and mild dread. It\u2019s the perfect setup for a resolution! What\u2019s yours?\n(And yes, the art is from another story, but setting up a good backup regime isnt a bad resolution either.)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

As a teenager youd round up a drummer and a few guitar players and start jamming out of a garage, hoping to build to bigger and bigger venues. Few people made it for plenty of reasons, not least of which was because putting together a band like this is expensive. It wasnt until capable electronic devices became mainstream and accepted in popular culture in the last decade or two that a few different paths for success finally opened up, and this groovebox shows just how much music can be created this way with a few straightforward electronic tools.\nThe groovebox is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and includes enough storage for 16 tracks with a sequencer for each track, along with a set of 16 scenes. Audio plays through PCM5102A DAC module, with a 160128 TFT display and a touch-sensitive pad for user inputs. Its not just a device for looping stored audio, though. Theres also a drum machine built in which can record and loop beats with varying sounds and pitches, as well as a sample slicer and a pattern generator and also as the ability to copy and paste clips.\nThere are a few limitations to using a device this small though. Because of memory size it outputs a 22 kHz mono signal, and its on-board storage is not particularly large either, but it does have an SD card slot for expansion. But its hard to beat the bang-for-the-buck qualities of a device like this, regardless, not to mention the portability. Especially when compared with the cost of multiple guitars, a drum set and a bunch of other analog equipment, its easy to see how musicians wielding these instruments have risen in popularity recently. This 12-button MIDI instrument could expand ones digital musical capabilities even further.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\uff01Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d6\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u697d\u5668\u306egroovebox\u306f\u3001\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3057\u3001\u7279\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\uff01Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d6\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u697d\u5668\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u306b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u8d08\u308b\uff01\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "\u300c16\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u3066\uff1a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5207\u308a\u958b\u304f\u300d"]}

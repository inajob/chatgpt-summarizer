By default, the 125 MHz figure is still what youll get, though. If you want a higher frequency, you need to set SYS_CLK_MHZ to 200 before doing a build.\nThey hint that more speed increases may happen in the future. If you want do go as fast as theyll allow, you can set PICO_USE_FASTEST_SUPPORTED_CLOCK=1 instead. This will always pick the highest frequency which is currently 200 MHz.\nThere are other updates, too, of course. We noted several bug fixes and a new version of TinyUSB. There are also some new examples, including a few that they forgot to mention in version 2.1.0. We were particularly interested in the mqtt examples, a PIO/DMA UART example, and the multi CDC USB example, something weve struggled to work around before on other projects.\nSo what will you do with a faster Pico? We doubt we are going to see a practical 1 GHz overclock. The emphasis is on the word practical. But we have seen 312 MHz."}

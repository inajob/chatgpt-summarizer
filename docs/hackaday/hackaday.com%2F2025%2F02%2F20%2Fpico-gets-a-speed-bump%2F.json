By default, the 125 MHz figure is still what youll get, though. If you want a higher frequency, you need to set SYS_CLK_MHZ to 200 before doing a build.\nThey hint that more speed increases may happen in the future. If you want do go as fast as theyll allow, you can set PICO_USE_FASTEST_SUPPORTED_CLOCK=1 instead. This will always pick the highest frequency which is currently 200 MHz.\nThere are other updates, too, of course. We noted several bug fixes and a new version of TinyUSB. There are also some new examples, including a few that they forgot to mention in version 2.1.0. We were particularly interested in the mqtt examples, a PIO/DMA UART example, and the multi CDC USB example, something weve struggled to work around before on other projects.\nSo what will you do with a faster Pico? We doubt we are going to see a practical 1 GHz overclock. The emphasis is on the word practical. But we have seen 312 MHz.", "title": "RP2040\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u304c200MHz\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u4e0a\u3052\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "body": "Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.1.1\u3067\u306f\u3001RP2040\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c200MHz\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["RP2040\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u304c200MHz\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u4e0a\u3052\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.1.1\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6ce8\u76ee\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "\u9ad8\u901f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044TinyUSB\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u904e\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3068Pico\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

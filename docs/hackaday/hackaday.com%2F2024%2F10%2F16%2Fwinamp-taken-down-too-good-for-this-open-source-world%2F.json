Youre a winner! The source for the Windows version of the venerable music player was released on GitHub three weeks ago, and after some derision over its licence terms, a bunch of possible open source violations, and the inadvertent release of some proprietary third-party code, its been taken down. Were sure that if you still have a burning desire to look at it then it wont be too difficult to find a copy through your favorite search engine, leaving the question of what really just happened.\nIts fairly obvious that the owners of the code lacked some level of understanding of just what open source really is, based on their not-really-open licence and all those code leaks. They did back down on not allowing people to create forks, but its evident that they didnt anticipate the reaction they got. So were they merely a bit clueless, or was it all just a publicity stunt involving a piece of software thats now of more historical than practical interest? Its possible well never know, but the story has provided those of us sitting on the fence eating popcorn with some entertainment.", "title": "Winamp\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u304cGitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3082\u77ed\u671f\u9593\u3067\u524a\u9664", "body": "Winamp\u306eWindows\u7248\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304cGitHub\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u8aa4\u3063\u3066\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u3001\u300c\u516c\u958b\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u300d\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u304c\u6b20\u3051\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3068\u6307\u6458\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6240\u6709\u8005\u306f\u53cd\u5fdc\u3092\u4e88\u671f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u7591\u554f\u304c\u6b8b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Winamp\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u304cGitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3082\u77ed\u671f\u9593\u3067\u524a\u9664", "Winamp\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u554f\u984c\u306b\u898b\u308b\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u516c\u958b\u306e\u6ce2\u7d0b", "Winamp\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u610f\u56f3\u3057\u306a\u3044\u7b2c\u4e09\u8005\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u542b\u307e\u308c\u4e00\u6642\u516c\u958b", "Winamp\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6d41\u51fa\u306b\u307f\u308b\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u306e\u4e0d\u8db3", "Winamp\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u516c\u958b\u9a12\u52d5\u3001\u5e83\u5831\u6d3b\u52d5\u306a\u306e\u304b\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u8208\u5473\u5bfe\u8c61\u306a\u306e\u304b"]}

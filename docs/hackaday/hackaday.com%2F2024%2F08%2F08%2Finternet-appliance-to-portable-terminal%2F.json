While it isnt powerful by modern standards, you can still use devices like this Cidco MailStation as a terminal.\nThe MailStation was originally designed as an email machine for people who werent onboard with this whole computer fad, keeping things simple with just an adjustable monchrome LCD, a keyboard, and a few basic applications. [Joshua Stein] developed a terminal application, msTERM, for the MailStation thanks to work previously done on decoding this device and the wealth of documentation for Z80 assembly.\nWhile [Stein] designed his program to access BBSes, we wonder if it might be a good way to do some distraction-free writing. If that wasnt enough, he also designed the WiFiStation dongle which lets you communicate over a network without all that tedious mucking about with parallel ports.\nIf youd like something designed specifically for writing, how about an AlphaSmart? Wanting to build your own Z80-based project? Why not start with an Altoids-sized Z80 SBC, but dont wait forever since Z80 production finally ended in June.\n\n"}

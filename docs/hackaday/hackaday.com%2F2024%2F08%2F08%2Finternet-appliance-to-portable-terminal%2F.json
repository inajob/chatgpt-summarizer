While it isnt powerful by modern standards, you can still use devices like this Cidco MailStation as a terminal.\nThe MailStation was originally designed as an email machine for people who werent onboard with this whole computer fad, keeping things simple with just an adjustable monchrome LCD, a keyboard, and a few basic applications. [Joshua Stein] developed a terminal application, msTERM, for the MailStation thanks to work previously done on decoding this device and the wealth of documentation for Z80 assembly.\nWhile [Stein] designed his program to access BBSes, we wonder if it might be a good way to do some distraction-free writing. If that wasnt enough, he also designed the WiFiStation dongle which lets you communicate over a network without all that tedious mucking about with parallel ports.\nIf youd like something designed specifically for writing, how about an AlphaSmart? Wanting to build your own Z80-based project? Why not start with an Altoids-sized Z80 SBC, but dont wait forever since Z80 production finally ended in June.\n\n", "title": "Z80\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "Z80\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u306f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Cidco MailStation\u306a\u3069\u3067\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002MailStation\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001Joshua Stein\u304cmsTERM\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002Z80\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u306f\u7d42\u4e86\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4eca\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["Z80\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Cidco MailStation\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "Joshua Stein\u306b\u3088\u308bMailStation\u306e\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u958b\u767a", "WiFiStation\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "Z80\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6311\u6226"]}

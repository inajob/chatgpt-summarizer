Some monitor their printers using webcams, but [Simit] has a more stylish method of keeping tabs on six 3D printers.\nThe idea is to use a 3D printed hex LED display found online. Adding an ESP32 and Home Assistant allows remote control of the display. The printers use Klipper and can report their status using an API called Moonraker. Each hexagon shows the status of one printer. You can tell if the printer is online, paused, printing, or in other states based on the color and amount of LEDs lit. For example, a hex turns totally green when printing is complete.\nOnce you have a web API and some network-controlled LEDs, it is relatively straightforward to link it together with Home Automation. Of course, you could do it other ways, too, but if you already have Home Automation running for other reasons, why not?\nWe have seen other ways to do this, of course. If you need an easy monitor, the eyes have it. If you dont use Klipper, OctoPrint can pull a similar stunt."}

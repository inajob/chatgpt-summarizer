The sensor ignores wood and plastic, but an approaching hand is easily detected. The sensor also detects liquid water with similar ease, either in the form of pooled liquid, or filled bottles.\nWeve also seen a spring elegantly used as a hidden touch sensor that works through an enclosures wall by using similar principles, so the next time you need a proximity or touch-sensitive sensor in a project, reaching for the junk box might get you where you need to go. Watch [mircemk]s sensor in action in the video, just below the page break.\n\n"}

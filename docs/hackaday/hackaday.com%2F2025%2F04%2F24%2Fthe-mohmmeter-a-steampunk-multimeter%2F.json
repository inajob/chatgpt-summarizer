Dubbed the Mohmmeter  a playful nod to its ohmmeter function and her mom  this project combines technical ingenuity with heartfelt craftsmanship.\n\nAt its core, a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller reads the selector knob, controls relays, and lights up LEDs on the front panel to show the meter\u2019s active range. The Mohmmeter offers two main measurement modes, each with two sub-ranges for greater precision across a wide spectrum.\nShe also included circuitry protections against reverse polarity and over-voltage, ensuring durability. There was also a great deal of effort put into ensuring it was accurate, as the device was put though its paces using a calibrated meter as reference to ensure the final product was as useful as it was beautiful.\nThe enclosure is a work of art, crafted from colorful wooden panels meticulously jointed together. Stamped brass plates label the meter\u2019s ranges and functions, adding a steampunk flair. This thoughtful design reflects her dedication to creating something truly special.\nWant to build a meter for mom, but shes more of the goth type? The blacked-out Hydameter might be more here style.", "title": "- \u6bcd\u3078\u306e\u611b\u60c5\u3092\u8fbc\u3081\u305f\u30e2\u30ba\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "Agatha\u304c\u6bcd\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30e2\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3001\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6bcd\u3078\u306e\u611b\u60c5\u3092\u8fbc\u3081\u305f\u30e2\u30ba\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5148\u9032\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u7cbe\u5ea6\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u305f\u5fc3\u6e29\u307e\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u30b4\u30b9\u98a8\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30de\u30de\u3092\u559c\u3070\u305b\u3088\u3046"]}

When these break they are often proprietary and not easy to repair, as was the case with a broken Pioneer surround-sound device given to [Boz]. It sat on the shelf for a few years until he had the idea of a jukebox for his ripped CDs, and his returning it to life with a new main board is something to behold.\nInternally its a surprisingly modular design, meaning that the front panel with its VFD display and driver were intact and working, as were the class AB amplifier and its power supply. He had the service manual so reverse engineering was straightforward, thus out came the main board in favor of a replacement. He took the original connectors and a few other components, then designed a PCB to take them and a Raspberry Pi Pico and DAC. With appropriate MMBASIC firmware it looks as though it was originally made this way, a sense heightened by a look at the motherboard inside (ignoring a couple of bodges).\nWe like seeing projects like this one which revive broken devices, and this one is particularly special quality wise. Were more used to seeing it with gaming hardware though.", "title": "- \u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3001\u30b8\u30e3uke\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u518d\u751f\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u58ca\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b8\u30e3ukebox\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u518d\u751f", "- \u9006\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u6539\u826f\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

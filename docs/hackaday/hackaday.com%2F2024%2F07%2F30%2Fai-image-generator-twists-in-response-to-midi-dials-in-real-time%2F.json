The results are wild, with an interactivity to them that we dont normally see in such things.\n\n[Johannes] uses Stable Diffusions SDXL Turbo to create a baseline image of photo of a red brick house, blue sky. The hardware dials act as manual controls for applying different embeddings to this baseline, such as coral, moss, fire, ice, sand, rusty steel and cookie.\nBy adjusting the dials, those embeddings are applied to the base image in varying strengths. The results are generated on the fly and are pretty neat to see, especially since there is no appreciable amount of processing time required.\nThe MIDI controller is integrated with the help of lunar_tools, a software toolkit on GitHub to facilitate creating interactive exhibits. As for the image end of things, weve previously covered how AI image generators work."}

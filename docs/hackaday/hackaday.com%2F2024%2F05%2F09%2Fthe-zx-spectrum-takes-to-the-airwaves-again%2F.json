Through our colleague [Voja Antoni\u0107] for example weve gained an unparalleled insight into the cutting edge of 8-bit computing in 1980s Yugoslavia, of his Galaksija home computer, and of software being broadcast over [Zoran Modli]s Ventilator 202 radio show.\nWere strongly reminded of this by hearing of the Slovenian Radio \u0160tudent broadcasting the classic Slovenian ZX Spectrum text adventure game Kontrabant 2, at the behest of the\u00a0 Slovenian Computer History Museum. Its been four decades and a lot of turbulent history, but once again 8-bit code will be heard on FM in Europe.\nSome of our younger readers may never have experienced the joy of loading software from cassette, but in those days it represented a slow alternative to the eye-wateringly expensive floppy drives of the day. The software was represented as a serial bitstream translated into tones and recorded on a standard cassette recorder which was standard consumer electronics back then, and when played back through a speaker it was an ear-splitting sound with something in common with that of a modem handshake from a decade or more later. This could easily be transmitted over a radio station, and a few broadcasters tried experimental technology shows doing just that.\nWe havent heard from any listeners who managed to catch the game and run it on their Spectrum, but we hope that Slovenias retrocomputing community were out in force even if Audacity and a n emulator replaced the original hardware. Given that more than one hacker camp in our community has sported radio stations whether legal or not, it would be nice to hear the dulcet tones of 8-bit software on the airwaves again.\nMeanwhile if cassettes are too cheap for you, feast your eyes on Sir Clives budget storage solution.\nThanks [Stephen Walters].", "title": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6700\u5148\u7aef\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u300cHackaday\u300d\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u30011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u3067\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u306e\u56de\u9867\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u3002\u30b9\u30ed\u30d9\u30cb\u30a2\u306eZX Spectrum\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304cFM\u3067\u653e\u9001\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u559c\u3073\u3084\u3001\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u6280\u8853\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6700\u5148\u7aef\u6280\u8853", "\u30b9\u30ed\u30d9\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40\u3001Spectrum\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092FM\u653e\u9001", "\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8aad\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\uff1a\u6614\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40\u30678\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1aSir Clives\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

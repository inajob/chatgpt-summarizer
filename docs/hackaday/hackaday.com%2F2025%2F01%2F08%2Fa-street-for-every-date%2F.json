An aspect of this fascinated [Ben Ashforth], who decided to find all the streets in Europe named after auspicious dates, and then visit enough to make a calendar. He gave a lightning talk about it at last years EMF Camp, which weve embedded below.\nStarting with an aborted attempt to query Google Maps, he then moved on to the OpenStreetMap database. From there he was able to construct a list of date-related street name across the whole of Europe, and reveal a few surprising things about their distribution. He came up with a routing algorithm to devise the best progression in which to see them, and with a few tweaks to account for roads whose names had changed, arrived at an epic-but-efficient traversal of the continent. The result is a full years calendar of street names, which you can download from his website.\nBeing used to significant Interrail travel where this is written, we approve of an algorithmically generated Euro trip. Were indebted to [Barney Livingstone] for the tip, and we agree with him that 150 slides in a 5 minute talk is impressive indeed.\n\n", "title": "- \u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u5409\u65e5\u540d\u306e\u8857\u3092\u5de1\u308b\u5192\u967a", "body": "\u30d9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u8857\u540d\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u65c5\u884c\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u7acb\u3066\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u5409\u65e5\u540d\u306e\u8857\u3092\u5de1\u308b\u5192\u967a", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u6b27\u5dde\u306e\u8857\u9053\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u8857\u540d\u63a2\u7d22", "- \u65c5\u884c\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u540d\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- EMF\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6982\u8981"]}

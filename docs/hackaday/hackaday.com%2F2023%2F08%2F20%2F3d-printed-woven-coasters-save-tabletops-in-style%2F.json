But there is so much more to 3D printing, as [andrei.erdei]s printed, woven coasters demonstrate.\nThe design is based on the stake and strand basket weaving technique, which uses rigid strips called stakes in one direction and thinner strips called strands in the other. Since the flexibility of PLA is questionable, [andrei] printed the stakes already bent in a square wave pattern that accommodates the strands fairly easily. To tie the coasters together and make them look more polished and commercial, [andrei] designed a holder as well.\nThe awesome thing about this technique is that you can do so much with it, like varying the stakes widths or making them diagonal instead of square. [andrei] designed these in Tinkercad using Codeblocks; of course, they are open source. Be sure to check out the assembly video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7de8\u307f\u6a21\u69d8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u300d", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u7de8\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002PLA\u306e\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u3001\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u56db\u89d2\u6ce2\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u66f2\u3052\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u3082\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u53c2\u8003\u307e\u3067\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u3054\u89a7\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7de8\u307f\u6a21\u69d8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u300d", "\u300c\u53ef\u5909\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30af\u5e45\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u300d", "\u300c\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308bPLA\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7de8\u307f\u6a21\u69d8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u52d5\u753b\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7de8\u307f\u6a21\u69d8\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6848\u300d"]}

But [The Swedish Maker] decided to put this concept to the test, diving into a full woodworking project while wearing a Meta Quest 3. You can check out the full experiment here, but let\u2019s break down the highs, lows, and slightly terrifying moments of this unconventional build.\nThe plan: complete a full furniture build while using the VR headset for everything\u2014from sketching ideas to cutting plywood. The Meta Quest 3\u2019s passthrough mode provided a semi-transparent AR view, allowing [The Swedish Maker] to see real-world tools while overlaying digital plans. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, the reality was more like a VR fever dream. Depth perception was off, measuring was a struggle, and working through a screen-delayed headset was nauseating at best. Yet, despite the warped visuals, the experiment uncovered some surprising advantages\u2014like the ability to overlay PDFs in real-time without constantly running back to a computer.\nSo is VR useful to the future of woodworking? If youre a woodworking novice, you might steer clear from VR and read up on the basics first. For the more seasoned: maybe, when headsets evolve beyond their current limitations. For now, it\u2019s a hilarious, slightly terrifying experiment that might just inspire the next wave of augmented reality workshops. If youre more into electronics, we did cover the possibilities with AR some time ago.

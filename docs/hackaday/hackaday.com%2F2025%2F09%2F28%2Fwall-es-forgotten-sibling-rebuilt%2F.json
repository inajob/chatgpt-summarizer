Apparently, [Leviathan engineering] did, and he wasnt as struck by the title character, or Eva, or even the Captain. He was captivated by BURN-E. His working model shows up in the video below.\nWell be honest. BURN-E didnt ring a bell for us, though we remember the movie. He grabbed a 3D design for the robot on the Internet and planned out holes for some servos and other hardware.\n\nThat was the idea, anyway. Turns out he didnt quite leave enough clearance for the motors, so a little hand surgery was in order. The painting was, by his own admission, suboptimal (we would point him to oil paint markers, which are amazing).\nThe next step was to get the servos actually working, along with the small LCD screen. Space in the body is tight, so it took a few tries to get everything wired up. We didnt see any code, but it should be pretty simple to draw the eyes and move the servos as you like.\nWe cant remember seeing another BURN-E build. But weve seen a number of WALL-Es.\u00a0 Some have even been useful.\n"}

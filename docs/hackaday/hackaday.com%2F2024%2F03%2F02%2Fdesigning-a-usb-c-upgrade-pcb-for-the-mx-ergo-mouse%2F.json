But its fair to say that these days a micro USB port has become a pretty rare sight, and the once ubiquitous cable can be a bit elusive in the event that you encounter an older device that requires it.\n[Solderking] has a high-end Logitech cordless mouse with just this problem, and so he replaced its micro USB socket with a USB-C port. That makes the task sound deceptively simple, because in fact he had to reverse engineer one of the devices PCBs in its entirety, making a new board with the same outline and components, but sporting the new connector.\nInstead of attempting to replicate the complex shape with geometry he started with a scan of the board and had Fusion 360 trace its outline before 3D printing a version of it to check fit in the Logitech case. Then it was a case of tracing the circuit, designing the replacement, and hand transferring the parts from board to board.\nThe result is a USB-C chargeable mouse, and while all the design files dont appear to be online, its possible to download the Gerbers from a PCBWay page. On top of that theres a YouTube video of the process which weve placed below the break.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen somebody spin up a new board to add USB-C to an older device  this drop-in replacement for Sonys DualShock 4 comes to mind. If youve got enough free space inside your particular gadget, you might be able to pull of a USB-C conversion with nothing more exotic than a hacked up Adafruit breakout board.\n\n"}

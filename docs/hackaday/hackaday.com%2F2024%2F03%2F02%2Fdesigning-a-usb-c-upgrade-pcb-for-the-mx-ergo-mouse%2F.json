But its fair to say that these days a micro USB port has become a pretty rare sight, and the once ubiquitous cable can be a bit elusive in the event that you encounter an older device that requires it.\n[Solderking] has a high-end Logitech cordless mouse with just this problem, and so he replaced its micro USB socket with a USB-C port. That makes the task sound deceptively simple, because in fact he had to reverse engineer one of the devices PCBs in its entirety, making a new board with the same outline and components, but sporting the new connector.\nInstead of attempting to replicate the complex shape with geometry he started with a scan of the board and had Fusion 360 trace its outline before 3D printing a version of it to check fit in the Logitech case. Then it was a case of tracing the circuit, designing the replacement, and hand transferring the parts from board to board.\nThe result is a USB-C chargeable mouse, and while all the design files dont appear to be online, its possible to download the Gerbers from a PCBWay page. On top of that theres a YouTube video of the process which weve placed below the break.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen somebody spin up a new board to add USB-C to an older device  this drop-in replacement for Sonys DualShock 4 comes to mind. If youve got enough free space inside your particular gadget, you might be able to pull of a USB-C conversion with nothing more exotic than a hacked up Adafruit breakout board.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30ed\u30b8\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u300d", "body": "USB-C\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db\u4f5c\u696d\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001[Solderking]\u304c\u9ad8\u7d1a\u306aLogitech\u7121\u7dda\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306emicro USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u5370\u5237\u3057\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3057\u3066\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u3002USB-C\u3067\u5145\u96fb\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30ed\u30b8\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edUSB\u304b\u3089USB-C\u3078\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306bPCB\u3092\u9006\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u3044USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300cUSB-C\u5145\u96fb\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01\u624b\u9806\u306eYouTube\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u300d", "\u300cUSB-C\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db\u306fAdafruit\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\uff1f\u300d"]}

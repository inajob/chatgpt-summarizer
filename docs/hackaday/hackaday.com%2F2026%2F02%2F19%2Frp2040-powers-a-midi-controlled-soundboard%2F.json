If thats who you want to be, you might like this soundboard project from [Biker Glen].\nThe build is based around an RP2040 microcontroller. Its paired with an I2S digital-to-analog converter for sound output, which in turn feeds a small amplifier hooked up to a speaker or a line output.\u00a0 The RP2040 is programmed to respond to MIDI commands by playing various sounds in response, which are loaded off a microSD card. Its able to act as a USB MIDI host, which allows it to work seamlessly with all sorts of off-the-shelf MIDI controllers like the MIDI Fighter or the Novation Launchpad.\nIts an interesting hardware solution to a problem that you could probably also solve with software on your streaming machine, especially if youve already got a USB MIDI controller. However, theres something to be said for lightening the load when your streaming computer is already doing lots of hard work to truck video up to the cloud already. Files are on Github if youre eager to replicate the build.\nSoundboards are just\u00a0fun,\u00a0which is why weve featured them before. Meanwhile, if youre whipping up your own streaming accessories at home, be sure to let us know on the tipsline!"}

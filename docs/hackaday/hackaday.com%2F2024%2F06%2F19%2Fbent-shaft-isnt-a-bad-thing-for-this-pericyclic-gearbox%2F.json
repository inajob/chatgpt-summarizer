We generally want everything running straight and true, with gears and wheels perfectly perpendicular to their shafts, with everything moving smoothly and evenly. Thats not always the case, though, as this pericyclic gearbox demonstrates.\nAlthough most of the components in [Retsetman] model gearboxes seem familiar enough  its mostly just a collection of bevel gears, like youd see inside a differential  its their arrangement that makes everything work. More specifically, its the shaft upon which the bevel gears ride, which has a section that is tilted relative to the axis of the shaft. Its just a couple of degrees, but that small bit of inclination, called mutation, makes the ring gear riding on it wobble as the shaft rotates, allowing it to mesh with one or more ring gears that are perpendicular to the shaft. This engages a few teeth at a time, transferring torque from one gear to another. Its easier to visualize than it is to explain, so check out the video below.\nGearboxes like these have a lot of interesting properties, with the main one being gear ratio. [Retsetman] achieved a 400:1 ratio with just 3D printed parts, which of course impose their own limitations. But he was still able to apply some pretty serious torque. The arrangement is not without its drawbacks, of course, with the wobbling bits naturally causing unwelcome vibrations. That can be mitigated to some degree using multiple rotatins elements that offset each other, but that only seems to reduce vibration, not eliminate it.\n[Retsetman] is no stranger to interesting gearboxes, of course, with his toothless magnetic gearboxes coming to mind. And this isnt the only time weve seen gearboxes go all wobbly, either.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip."}

(Credit: Matt Denton)\nIts part of the great circle of life that toys and scale models that provide a reflection of macro-sized objects like vehicles and buildings will eventually be scaled up again to life-sized proportions. Case in point the LEGO Technic dune buggy that [Matt Denton] recently printed at effectively human scale, while also making it actually drivable.\nThe basis for this project is the 8845 Dune Buggy which was released in 1981. Unlike the modern 42101 version, its more straightforward and also seems more amenable to actually sitting in despite featuring more pieces for a total of 174 pieces.\u00a0 Naturally, [Matt] didnt simply go for a na\u00efve build of the 8845 buggy, but made a few changes. First is the scale thats 10.42 times larger than the LEGO original, based around the use of 50 mm bearings. The model was also modified to be a single-seater, with the steering wheel placed in the center.\nWith some structural and ergonomic tweaks in place, the resulting CAD model was printed out mostly in PLA with a 1 mm nozzle and 10% infill using a belt FDM printer to help with the sheer size of the parts. After that it was mostly a LEGO kit assembly on a ludicrous scale that resembles a cross between building a LEGO kit and assembling Ikea flatpack furniture.\nAt merely the cost of most of his sanity, [Matt] finally got the whole kit together, still leaving a few suspension issues to resolve, as it turns out that so much plastic actually weighs a lot, at 102 kg. With that and other issues resolved, the final touch was to add an electric motor to the whole kit using a belt-driven system on the rear axle and bringing every LEGO minifigs dreams to life.\nAfter a few test drives, some issues did pop up, including durability concerns and not a lot of performance, but overall it performs much better than youd expect from a kids toy.\n\n"}

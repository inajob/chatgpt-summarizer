The reality of living in a 1950s or 60s house was probably to be surrounded by the usual mess of possessions from many past decades, but the promise was of a beautiful sleek and futuristic living space. Central to this in most homes would have been the TV set, and manufacturers followed the trends of the age with cases that are now iconic. Here in 2026 we put up with black rectangles, but fortunately theres Cordova Woodworking with a modern take on a retro TV cabinet.\nWeve put the build video below, and its a wonderfully watchable piece of workshop titillation in a fully-equipped modern shop. While we appreciate theyve put the design up for sale, we think many Hackaday readers could come up with their own having already been inspired. One thing we notice over the originals is that they use proper wood for their case, when we know the 60s version would have had veneer-faced ply or chipboard.\nThe result is a piece of furniture which nicely contains the modern TV and accessories, but doesnt weigh a ton or dominate the room in the way one of the originals would have, much less emit that evocative phenolic hot-electronics smell. Wed have one in our living room right now. Meanwhile if youd like a wallow in mid-century TV, we have you covered.\n\n"}

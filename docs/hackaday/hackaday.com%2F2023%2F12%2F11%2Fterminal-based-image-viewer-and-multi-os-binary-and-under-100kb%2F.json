Its also a small binary executable capable of running on six different operating systems: Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. All without having to be installed or otherwise compiled first. On top of it all, its less than 100 kb.\nHow is this possible? Its thanks to [Justine]s \u03b1c\u03c4\u00b5\u03b1lly p\u03b4r\u03c4\u03b1bl\u03b5 \u03b5x\u03b5c\u00b5\u03c4\u03b1bl\u03b5 format, implemented by a project called Cosmopolitan which aims to turn C into a build-once-run-anywhere language. The printimage.com source code is included within the Cosmopolitan project.\nIf the name sounds a familiar, its probably because the Cosmopolitan project is a key piece of a tool we recently covered: llamafile, which allows people to package up an LLM (large language model) as a single-file, multi-OS executable.\nAs printimage.com shows, terminal windows are capable of more than just text. Still, plain ASCII has its appeal. Check out the ASCII art STL file viewer which might just make your next sick ASCII art banner a bit easier to generate."}

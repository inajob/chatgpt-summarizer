This semi-spherical hunk of metal would become the heart of the Selectric typewriter line. [James Brown] has now leveraged that very concept to create a pivoting mouth mechanism for a robot that appears to talk.\nWhat youre looking at is a plastic ball with lots of different mouth shapes on it. By pivoting the ball to different angles inside the head of a robot, its possible to display different mouth shapes on the face. By swapping mouth shapes rapidly in concert with recorded speech, its possible to make the robot appear to be speaking. We dont get a great look at the mechanism that operates the ball, but Selectric typeball operation is well documented elsewhere if you seek to recreate the idea yourself.\nThe real benefit of this mechanism is speed. It might not look as fluid as some robots with manually-articulated flexible mouths, but the rapid mouth transitions really help sell the effect because they match the pace of speech. [James] demonstrated the finished product on Mastodon, and it looks great in action.\nThis isnt the first time weve featured [James Brown]s work. You may recall he got DOOM running on a tiny LEGO brick a few years back.\nThanks to [J. Peterson] for the tip!"}

It was found to be hackable, and one of the most successful projects to take advantage of it was a media centre. You know it as Kodi, but its previous name was XBMC, for Xbox Media Centre. The last version that still ran on an original Xbox saw the light of day in 2016, so its definitely a surprise that a new version has appeared.\nXBMC version 4.0 brings a host of new features to the venerable platform, including the Estuary user interface that will be famniliar to users of more recent Kodi versions, a better games library,, and more. The plugin system has been revamped too, and while it retains the Python 2 version from back in the day its promised that a Python 3 update is in the works. Thats right, it sounds as though there will be more releases. Get them from the GitHub repository.\nWere not sure how many of you have early Xbox hardware along with the inclination to use it as a media centre, after all Kodi runs so well on a lot of very accessible hardware. But were impressed that the developers of this release have managed so much within the confines of a machine with a 2000s-era spec, and have released it at all.\nIf youre curious about Xbox hacking, take a look at some of its early history.", "title": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebXbox\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u606f\u5439\uff1aXBMC 4.0\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebXbox\u5411\u3051\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044XBMC 4.0\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebXbox\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u606f\u5439\uff1aXBMC 4.0\u306e\u767b\u5834", "Xbox\u306b\u518d\u6d3b\u529b\uff01\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u306eXBMC 4.0", "\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eXbox\uff1aKodi\u306e\u9032\u5316", "\u53e4\u3044Xbox\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "Xbox\u306e\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308bXBMC 4.0"]}

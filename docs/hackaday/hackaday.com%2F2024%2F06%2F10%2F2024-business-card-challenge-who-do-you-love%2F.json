But what if you could know almost instantly whether they felt the same way? With the Dr. Love card, you can erase all doubt.\nAs you may have guessed, the card uses Galvanic Skin Response. Thats the fancy term for the fact that your skins electrical properties change when you sweat, making it easier for electricity to pass through it. There are two sensors, one on each short end of the card where you would both naturally touch it upon exchange. Except this time, if you want to test the waters, youll have to wait 10-15 seconds while Dr. Love assesses your chemistry.\nThe doctor in this case is an RP2040-LCD-0.96, which is what it sounds like  a Raspberry Pi Pico with a small LCD attached. For the sensors, [Un Kyu Lee] simply used 8mm-wide strips of nickel. If you want to build your own, be sure to check out the build guide and watch the video after the break for a demonstration of Dr. Love in action.\n\n\n \n\n"}

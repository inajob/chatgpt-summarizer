[Mootroidxproductions] recently released the official music video for I Fight Dragons 2019 song Oh the Places Youll Go.\nThe song was written by lead vocalist [Brian Mazzaferri] with inspiration from the classic Dr. Seuss book. [Brain] wrote it for his newborn daughter, and were pretty sure it will hit any parent right in the feels.\n[Mootroidxproductions] isnt a parent themselves, but they expanded on the theme to create a video about sacrificing oneself to save a loved one. With a self deprecating wit, they take us through the process of turning broken Bionicle parts, bits of Gundam, Lego, and, armature wire to make the two robots in the film. He also explains how he converted garbage into sets, greebles, and lighting effects.\nThe robots had to be designed so that they could fulfill their roles in the film. From the size of their hands down to their individual walking gaits, he thought of everything. His encyclopedic knowledge of Bionicle parts is also on full display as he explains the origin of the major parts used to build Little Blue and Sherman\nClick through the break for both the main video and the behind-the-scenes production.\n\nI Fight Dragons themselves have a strong chiptune influence. Many of their songs make use of the NES, SNES, and GameBoy sound engines.\u00a0 They even used retro controllers, a power glove, and a power pad in some of their earlier works. Were saddened to hear the band has gone on an indefinite hiatus. We just hope theyll be back someday to make more great music  hopefully with [Mootroidxproductions] animating the videos.\n\n\n"}

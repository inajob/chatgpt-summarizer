With each new version of the hardware weve gotten the occasional peek under the hood or source code walk-through, but these limited presentations have made it somewhat difficult to really appreciate the scale of this undertaking.\nBut now thanks to this epic hour-long tour of the hardware and software that makes up version 2.5 of his\u00a0Voyager tricorder, we can finally see just how incredible the engineering thats gone into this project really is. Every detail has been meticulously considered to deliver a final product thats not only as visually accurate as possible, but reliable enough to actually carry around.\nIn the video, [Mangy_Dog] demonstrates how the new version of the tricorder can be dissembled with just a few common tools, which he felt was an important goal for the project so that it could be repaired and potentially even upgraded over time. Not that theres much breathing room inside the enclosure for new goodies  the density of the internal electronics is astounding, perhaps the highest weve ever seen in a homebrew project like this.\nTheres seven separate PCBs in the top half of the tricorder alone, with the most important ones being (relatively) easy to remove should they require service. More electronics are hiding in the lower half of the device, but unfortunately those needed to be permanently sealed up in the case so as not to ruin the futuristic Trek aesthetic with unsightly screws or access hatches.\nWhat we found particularly interesting was hearing about all the little bodges and fixes that hes had to implement. Even after several hardware revisions, with the dizzying array of components packed into this build, the occasional goof is simply inevitable. [Mangy_Dog] points each one out, explains what the cause was, and shows how he implemented the repair. Its an important reminder that, even in the most fantastically engineered projects, theres always room to improve and sharpen your skills.\nWhile three-quarters or so of the videos total runtime is dedicated to going over the hardware, he does dedicate a bit towards the end towards the software that pulls it all together. Though he only goes through a few subroutines and functions, its clear that [Mangy_Dog] is just as adept with with the keyboard as he is with the soldering iron.\nEven Starfleet Engineering needs to use the occasional bodge wire.\nTo close out the video he goes over some of the other projects hes working on, and knowing the level of detail and professionalism he brings to all of his creations, we cant wait to see what hes got in store for us next.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u51c4\u3044\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30c0\u30a4\u30d6", "body": "\u300cMangy_Dog\u300d\u306f\u3001\u6700\u3082\u6280\u8853\u7684\u304b\u3064\u7f8e\u7684\u306b\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f32.5\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5de5\u5b66\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306f\u4fee\u7406\u3084\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3082\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u51c4\u3044\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30c0\u30a4\u30d6", "\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u88fd\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u9ad8\u5091\u4f5c", "\u5bc6\u96c6\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u9a5a\u304d\uff01\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f32.5\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3082\u629c\u7fa4\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5168\u8c8c"]}

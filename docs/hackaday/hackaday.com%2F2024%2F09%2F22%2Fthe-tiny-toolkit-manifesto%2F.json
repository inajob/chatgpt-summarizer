If an items seems to see little use, put a piece of tape with the date on it every time it comes out, to put a number on it. As an example he ended up culling a multi-tool from his kit, not because its not an extremely useful tool, but because he found everything it did was better done by other items in the kit.\nIts probable well all look at our carry-around kit with new eyes after watching this, its certain that ours could use a few tweaks. Whats in your kit, and how could you improve it? Let us know in the comments.\n\n"}

[Robo Hub] now has a plastic sunflower that tracks the sun using, of course, an Arduino. It may not qualify as a real robot, but it does mimic a real sunflower. The electronics arent earth-shattering, of course. An Arduino, a light sensor, and a servo motor are all you really need. But we enjoyed the whimsy and the artistic sensibility. This would be a great school project, for example. Interesting enough to get kids interested but not so hard as to be undoable. You can see a video of the ersatz flower below.\nThere are actually a pair of light sensors, as you might expect. That way you can determine which sensor is getting the most light. Obviously, these cant be on-off sensors. They are, in fact, light-dependent resistors, so you get a nice analog reading.\nOf course, you might not need an Arduino for this. A 555 driving a servo and a handful of discrete components could measure a bridge with the photoresistors and get the same effect. On the other hand, a microcontroller these days is inexpensive and versatile, so why not?\nUsually, people tracking the sun are trying to get more energy. That doesnt have to be any more complicated, though.\n\n", "title": "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u3072\u307e\u308f\u308a\u304c\u592a\u967d\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b", "body": "Robo Hub\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u3072\u307e\u308f\u308a\u3002Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u592a\u967d\u3092\u8ffd\u5c3e\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3067\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002\u5149\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\uff12\u500b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u3072\u307e\u308f\u308a\u304c\u592a\u967d\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3059\u308b", "\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3044\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u592a\u967d\u8ffd\u8de1\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc", "\u5b50\u4f9b\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u592a\u967d\u8ffd\u8de1\u30b5\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u592a\u967d\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u308b", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u592a\u967d\u8ffd\u8de1\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

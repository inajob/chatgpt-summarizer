Thats not to say it cant do\u00a0anything\u00a0that sounds cool, however. As [Action Retro] demonstrates,\u00a0 its got some really impressive tricks up its sleeve if you know what youre doing.\nThe video centers around Music Mouse, a piece of software created by Laurie Spiegel for the Macintosh Plus all the way back in 1986. Spiegel saw the Macintosh Plus as a potential instrument for musical expression, with the then-innovative mouse as the key human interface.\n[Action Retro] shows off the software, which is able to create rather pleasing little melodies with little more than a swish and a swash across the mousepad. The software makes smart use of scales so youre not forever dodging around dissonant notes, so its quite easy to play something beautiful. He then makes things more interesting by pairing the Macintosh Plus with his favorite guitar pedal\u2014the Old Blood Noise Endeavors Sunlight. Its a dynamic reverb that really opens up the sonic landscape when paired with the Mac Plus. If youre looking for a weird avant-garde setup to take on stage at your next noise show, this has to be it.\nWere usually used to seeing Nintendo and Commodore products in the retro computer music space. The Mac makes a nice change. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "Macintosh Plus\u3068Music Mouse\uff1a\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u697d\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u306f\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u3084\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u95a2\u9023\u304c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3059\u8a18\u4e8b\u30021986\u5e74\u306bLaurie Spiegel\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305fMusic Mouse\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u8868\u73fe\u80fd\u529b\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["Macintosh Plus\u3068Music Mouse\uff1a\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u697d\u88fd\u4f5c", "Macintosh Plus\u3068Guitar Pedal\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306aMacintosh Plus\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u524d\u885b\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u697d", "Macintosh Plus\u3068Mouse\uff1a\u97f3\u697d\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5", "Macintosh Plus\u3068\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b"]}

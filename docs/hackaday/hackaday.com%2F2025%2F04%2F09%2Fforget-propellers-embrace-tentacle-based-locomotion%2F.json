The result is a pretty unconventional-looking device that can not only get around effectively, but can do so without disturbing marine life.\nZodiAq sports a soft flexible appendage from each of its twelve faces, but they arent articulated like you might think. Despite this, the device can crawl and swim.\nWith movement inspired by bacterial flagella, ZodiAq moves in an unusual but highly controllable way.\nEach soft appendage is connected to a motor, which rotates the attached appendage. This low-frequency but high-torque rotation, combined with the fact that each appendage has a 45\u00b0 bend to it, has each acting as a rotor. Rotation of the appendages acts on the surrounding fluid, generating thrust. When used together in the right way, these appendages allow the unit to move in a perfectly controllable manner.\nThis locomotion method is directly inspired by the swimming gait of bacterial flagella (which the paper mentions are regarded as the only example of a biological wheel.)\nHow fast can it go? The prototype covers a distance of two body lengths every fifteen seconds. True, its no speed demon compared to a propeller, but it doesnt disturb marine life or environments as it moves around. This method of movement has a lot going for it. Its adaptable and doesnt use all twelve appendages at once; so theres redundancy built in. If some get damaged or go missing, it can still move, just slower.\nZodiAqs design strikes us as a very accessible concept, should any aspiring marine robot hackers wish to give it a shot. Weve seen other highly innovative and beautiful underwater designs as well, like body-length undulating fins and articulated soft arms.\nWe do notice that since it lacks a front  it might be a challenge to decide how to mount something like a camera.

We sure do  they were all the rage for a while, and then it seemed like everyone just sort of lost interest in them. There are probably a lot of reasons for that, not least of which is likely the amount of work it takes to put one together from discrete LEDs and separate pieces of wire. Could there be a better way?\nOf course there could, and [Sasa Karanovic] thought he had it all figured out with this PCB-based LED cube. At first glance, it seems to make perfect sense; after all, werent PCBs invented to take the place of all that pesky point-to-point wiring in the early days of electronics? The boards [Sasa] designed are pretty cool, actually. Theyve each got room for 16 addressable WS2812 LEDs in 5 mm packages, with every possible bit of substrate removed to block the minimum amount of light. That left very little room for traces on the 2-mm-wide arms, so the PCBs had to have four layers, which raised eyebrows at the PCB house when [Sasa] submitted the design.\nSuch an airy and open design obviously has the potential for mechanical issues, which [Sasa] addressed by adding pads at three corners of each board; a vertical PCB connects to each LED board to provide mechanical support and distribute signals to the LEDs. The cube seems solid enough as a result, and even when handled the LED boards dont really flop around too much. See the cube in action in the video below.\nWhats nice about this design is the perfect spacing between the LEDs in all three dimensions, and the way everything lines up nice and straight. That would be really hard to do with wire, even for the most practiced of circuit sculptors. [Sasa] seems to agree, but still deems the build a failure because the PCBs block too much of the view. We suppose hes got a point, and were not sure how well this would scale to an 88 cube. Were not sure how wed feel about paying for PCBs that are mostly air either, but as failures go, this one still manages to be pretty successful.\n", "title": "PCB\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3001\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "LED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306f\u624b\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308a\u3001\u4eba\u6c17\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u3053\u306ePCB\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u3060\u300216\u500b\u306eWS2812 LED\u304c5mm\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308a\u3001\u8a2d\u8a08\u3082\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u306e\u304c\u96e3\u70b9\u3002", "titles": ["PCB\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3001\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\u306eLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1aPCB\u6280\u8853\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "PCB\u306e\u914d\u7f6e\u304c\u5b8c\u74a7\u306aLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u306b", "\u4f5c\u696d\u91cf\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059LED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u3078\uff1aPCB\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLED\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

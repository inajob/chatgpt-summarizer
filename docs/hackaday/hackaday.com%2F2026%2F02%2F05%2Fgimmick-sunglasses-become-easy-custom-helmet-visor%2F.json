But the best part is the technique used to create the visor: just design around a cheap set of full-face sunglasses to completely avoid having to mold your own custom faceplate.\nOne of the most challenging parts of any custom helmet build is how to make a high-quality visor or faceplate. Most folks heat up a sheet of plastic and form it carefully around a mold, but [GizmoThrill] approached the problem from the other direction. After spotting a full-face sun visor online, they decided to design the helmet around the readily-accessible visor instead of the other way around.\nThe first thing to do with the visor is cover it with painters tape and 3D scan it. Once thats done, the 3D model of the visor allows the rest of the helmet to be designed around it. In the case of the Satisfactory helmet, the design of the visor is a perfect match for the games helmet, but one could easily be designing their own custom headgear with this technique.\nThe hexagon grid pattern? Its actually a clear vinyl sticker and doesnt obstruct vision at all. Another clever touch.\nWith the helmet 3D printed, [GizmoThrill] heads to the bandsaw to cut away any excess from the visor, and secure it in place. Thats all there is to it! Sure, you dont have full control over the visors actual shape, but it sure beats the tons and tons of sanding involved otherwise.\nTheres a video tour of the whole process that shows off a number of other design features we really like. For example, metal mesh in the cheek areas and in front of the mouth means a fan can circulate air easily, so the one doesnt fog up the inside of the visor with ones very first breath. The mesh itself is concealed with some greebles mounted on top. You can see all those details up close in the video, embedded just below.\nThe helmet design is thanks to [Punished Props] and weve seen their work before. This trick for turning affordable and somewhat gimmicky sunglasses into something truly time-saving is definitely worth keeping in mind.\n\n", "title": "\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u300c\u30b5\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u30d8\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9f\u5ea6\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "body": "\u300cSatisfactory\u300d\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u6280\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b5\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u300c\u30b5\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d\u30d8\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9f\u5ea6\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30b5\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u6cd5", "3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d8\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30d8\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u5fc5\u9808\uff01\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u901a\u6c17\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u624b\u9593\u3092\u7701\u304f\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u306e\u89e3\u8aac"]}

They say so much about a person, because you see whats paramount to them in a keyboard. You can almost feel their frustration at other keyboards come through their design choices. And the Lobo by [no-restarts] is no exception to any of this.\nTheres just something about this Corne-like object with its custom case and highly-tappable and variously tilted keycaps. The list of reasons for being begins innocently enough with [no-restarts] wanting a picture of their dog on the case.\nImage by [no-restarts] via redditFrom there, things get really personal. You may notice the thumb cluster is slightly different  [no-restarts] doesnt like the thumb tuck required by the Corne to reach the innermost keys. I really dig the homing bumps on the middle thumb keys. Another difference is the splayed layout, as [no-restarts] is especially prone to pinky splay. Finally, there are a pair of OLEDs hiding on the inner sides of the case, which are designed to be visible when tented.\nOverall, [no-restarts] is happy with it, but has some ideas for revision. Yep, that sounds about right. The Lobo is all hand-wired, and theres a PCB with hot swap sockets in its future. If youre interested in the case files, GitHub is your friend.\n\nGetting a Handle on Grabshell\n[kurisutofujp] recently saw a GrabShell in the flesh, and why havent I heard of this keyboard before? The next best time is now, so here we go with the explanation, both for myself and the other 9,999.\nImage by [kurisutofujp] via redditEssentially, this thing is made for using while you wander around the office (or the Metaverse). You can hold it in mid-air, secured in your Gargoyle-ness with a pair of straps, your fingers wrapped around to hit the alphas.\nBut you dont have to use it that way, see. You can stand it up on the desk if you dont want to type in mid-air. It can also be opened sort of halfway and used like a SafeType vertical keyboard.\nIf none of this excites you, GrabShell can also be laid flat on the desk. The distance between the two halves in this configuration is quite generous, and frankly, Im a bit jealous.\nSo lets talk about the generous thumbing-around area. As youll see in the video below, the left has a joystick and a toggle switch that flips it from arrow keys to mouse cursor. Theres a serious-looking scroll wheel beneath that. All three of these can be pushed in for additional inputs.\nThe right side of the thumb panel has a sweet-looking trackball thats housed in a really cool-looking way. Another cool thing: theres a frigging I2C port on the top, just exposed and hanging out because reasons.\nSwitch-wise, the board is a mix of hot-swappable Gateron G Pro browns and low-profile Gaterons under double-shot ABS keycaps. I think it sounds nice in the video below; others say it sounds cheap and hollow. To each their own.\n\nThe Centerfold: ZMK Dongle Repackaged As Vintage Computer\nImage by me using images by [mharzhyall] via redditIts just so cute, thats why its here. The buttons, they do nothing, but thats okay  they might could do something in the future.\nThis is a ZMK dongle, like I said in the subheading, and [mharzhyall] put a new case around it. Basically it lets you connect keyboards wirelessly.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Edland Typewriter Was a Total Flop\nThe Antikey Chop reports that this curious little rook-looking index typewriter was such as flop as to be nearly lost to history entirely.\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nProduced between 1891 and 1893 by the Liberty Mfg. Company, the machine was conceived by Joseph Laurentius Edland of Brooklyn, NY. All seemed lost until 1964, when a handful of Edlands were found languishing in a warehouse in Galway, NY.\nAlthough only made for two years, there were three different versions developed. The one pictured here is the second, with a metal base and embossed index, whereas the first had a wood base and flat index.\nThe third version, the Typewheel Edland, had a typewheel for a print element \u00e0 la the Blick. Edlands cost a semi-reasonable $5 at the outset, but eventually doubled in price.\nSo, why the absolute failure? It was no better or worse a machine than its contemporaries, but perhaps just wasnt well-marketed.\u00a0Another theory is that the Edland failed because they were made of pot metal. Seems reasonable. Want to know how to use one? RTFM (PDF).\nFinally, a Keyboard with a Mechanical Watch Movement\nWait, what? Why though? Well, it ticks along as you type, is that cool? It might be fun to see if you can keep up a certain number of keystrokes per second. Okay, Im warming up to this idea pretty quickly, can you tell?\nThe Nama keyboard, dubbed after the scientific term for the mammoth, is appropriately named. It can weigh up to an astonishing 19.4 lbs (8.8 kg) depending on the case material. (Consider that a Model M, a proper bludgeoning device in its own right, weighs just 5 lbs (2.2 kg).)\nThis Nama has a tourbillion movement, the granddaddy of them all. Image by Wuque Studio via Notebook Check\nNama comes from Wuque Studio, and was built as an ode to their manufacturing capabilities. Now this is starting to make more sense. They are the Banana Republic to vendor Chilkeys Old Navy, who are the brand behind the ND75, if that rings any bells.\nNow the Nama looks like your basic mechanical keyboard on the surface, but five years of design decisions went into this line. You can get it with an aluminium case (14.5 lbs / 6.6 kg) or a brass CNCd case (18.95 lbs / 8.6 kg), which of course is what makes it so heavy.\nBut yeah, the defining feature is definitely the watch movement. You bet your Backspace its fully functional except as a watch, and it doubles as a volume control knob, so you dont have to settle for touching it with just your eyeballs.\nYeah, so the astute among you will have noticed that there are no numbers or hands on the watch movement, which would be, what, tacky? I dont know anymore. At any rate, its protected by a piece of sapphire glass, which should keep Cheetos dust and such out of there.\nOh, you want to know the cost? $749 for the bare-bones with no movement, and $1299 for the brass-bottomed boy with the tourbillion. Thats actually not that bad for a tourbillion movement.\n\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two.

LEGO happens to offer just such a device, built using its Technic line of blocks, shafts, and gears. Only, it has a serious limitation\u2014it has to be cranked manually to make it spin the Earth around the sun. [G\u00f6rkem] set out to fix this glaring oversight with some good old-fashioned hardware.\nThe setup removes just five LEGO pieces from the original design, eliminating the hand crank from the mechanism. In its place, [G\u00f6rkem] installed a NEMA 17 stepper motor, paired with a custom PCB mounted on the back. That carries an ESP32 microcontroller and a TMC2208 stepper motor driver set up for silent drive. Rigged up like so, the orrery can simulate the motion of the Earth and Moon around the Sun in real time. Theres also a knob to track back and forth in time, and a button to reset the system to the correct real-time position.\nThe final build looks great, combining the LEGO Technic parts with some chunky electronics and 7-segment displays that make it a wonderful techy desk decoration. Down the line, [G\u00f6rkem] hopes to offer a plug-and-play kit to others who wish to duly animate their own LEGO orrery sets (set #42179).\nWe love a good LEGO build around these parts. Weve featured everything from parts sorters to functional typewriters in the past.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2LEGO\u30aa\u30eb\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "LEGO\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2LEGO\u30aa\u30eb\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u5929\u4f53\u6a21\u578b", "- LEGO Technic\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730", "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30eb\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f", "- \u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5f69\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u88c5\u98fe\u54c1\u306e\u63d0\u6848"]}

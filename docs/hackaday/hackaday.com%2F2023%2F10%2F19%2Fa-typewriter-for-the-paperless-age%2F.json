For your best work theres a need to be in that elusive Zone, and for some that means making the experience as distraction free as possible. For them theres an entire class of minimalist word-processors and text editors which reduce the UI to nothing more than the text. [Adam Blumenberg] has taken this a step beyond software with his digital typewriter, a single-purpose Raspberry Pi-based cyberdeck that serves only for distraction-free writing.\nTheres not a lot in the way of descriptive text at the above link but in a way there doesnt need to be as the photographs tell the story. A mechanical keyboard and a wide but not very tall display fit with the Pi in a fairly rudimentary wooden case, and running Focuswriter it leaves very little in the way of distraction. In that sense its not quite so much a cyberdeck in its application as something more like the smart digital typewriters from a few decades ago without the printer, but we can see that it makes for a very handy writing implement. Sadly the job of writing for Hackaday requires constant access to online sources on a larger screen, or wed be tempted to try one ourselves.\nThe one-purpose writing computer is an idea weve seen before from time to time, for example in this one with an e-paper display."}

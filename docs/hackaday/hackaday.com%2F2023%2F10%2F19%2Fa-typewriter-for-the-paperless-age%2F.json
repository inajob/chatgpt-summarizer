For your best work theres a need to be in that elusive Zone, and for some that means making the experience as distraction free as possible. For them theres an entire class of minimalist word-processors and text editors which reduce the UI to nothing more than the text. [Adam Blumenberg] has taken this a step beyond software with his digital typewriter, a single-purpose Raspberry Pi-based cyberdeck that serves only for distraction-free writing.\nTheres not a lot in the way of descriptive text at the above link but in a way there doesnt need to be as the photographs tell the story. A mechanical keyboard and a wide but not very tall display fit with the Pi in a fairly rudimentary wooden case, and running Focuswriter it leaves very little in the way of distraction. In that sense its not quite so much a cyberdeck in its application as something more like the smart digital typewriters from a few decades ago without the printer, but we can see that it makes for a very handy writing implement. Sadly the job of writing for Hackaday requires constant access to online sources on a larger screen, or wed be tempted to try one ourselves.\nThe one-purpose writing computer is an idea weve seen before from time to time, for example in this one with an e-paper display.", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u6587\u7ae0\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3002\u6587\u5b57\u3060\u3051\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u3001\u5206\u6563\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Raspberry Pi\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc", "\u96c6\u4e2d\u529b\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7a76\u6975\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u74b0\u5883", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u6728\u88fd\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u6614\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u611f\u899a\u3092\u5473\u308f\u3048\u308bRaspberry Pi\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc"]}

EasyThreed make a range of very small printers pitched as toys, and while theyre no great shakes by the standards of most Hackaday readers, they do at least work out of the box. For their roughly $75 price tag they deliver what youd expect, but can such a basic machine be improved with a few upgrades? [Made with Layers] has taken a look.\nThese printers have an all-plastic snap-together construction with a 10 cm by 10 cm bed and a set of small geared stepper motors driving their axes. He concentrates on stiffening the structure, upgrading those motors, and because hes sponsored by a 3D printer electronics company, upgrading their controller.\nThe motors were replaced first with some NEMA 11 steppers, and then by some over-sized ones which maybe push the idea a little far. By moving the motors to a bracket he was able to free up their mountings to secure a 3D printed insert to stiffen the arms. Perhaps hes pushing it a little for the video with the electronics upgrade, but we think theres a happy medium with the smaller of the two motor upgrades and the stiffening.\nSo if you have an EasyThreed in your life its possible to upgrade it into something a little better, but its worth asking whether that $75 might be better spent in saving for a better machine in the first place. Weve been curious about these tiny printers for a while though, and its interesting to have some more of our questions answered.\n\n", "title": "\u300c$75\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u300d", "body": "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b5i3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u8131\u5374\u3057\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8d85\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002EasyThreed\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306f\u73a9\u5177\u3068\u3057\u3066\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u5f37\u5316\u306a\u3069\u6539\u5584\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u691c\u8a3c\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f$75\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u8cfc\u5165\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3059\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3059\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c$75\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f\u300d", "\u300cEasyThreed: \u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u8d85\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u300d", "\u300c\u5c0f\u578b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u300d", "\u300cNEMA 11\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3068\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u88dc\u5f37\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u300d"]}

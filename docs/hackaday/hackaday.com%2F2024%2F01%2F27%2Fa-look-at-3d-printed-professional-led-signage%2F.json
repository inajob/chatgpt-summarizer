High-quality signage can go a long way into creating a good impression in this respect. [king process] decided to show us how professional-grade LED signage is made in a Korean shop that specializes in the work.\nThe signs were shown are custom builds that are matched to the shape of a companys logo. No rectangular printed lightboxes here, this is fully custom stuff. To that end, a 3D printer is the perfect tool for the job, as it lets the shop produce signs in any shape desired with no need for custom tooling.\nThe 3D printers that build up the signs have seriously large build volumes, though more so in the X and Y dimensions rather than the Z. We see a whole fleet of printers working away to allow multiple signs to be produced quickly. The first step is to produce the outline of a sign, which serves as a base for the build. Cavities in the sign are then filled with a translucent silicone solution to act as diffuser material. Once cured, these various sections are colored by hand as required. LED strips are then installed on a backing plate to illuminate the sections of the sign.\nThe final result is a sign with clean, bright glowing lines. Its vaguely reminiscent of a neon sign, but without any of the limitations of the glass tubes influencing how it looks. Its also neat to see the techniques a professional shop uses to make things right the first time, without dinging or marring any of the parts along the way.\nIndeed, it seems the classical neon sign is, these days, bested by a variety of alternative technologies.\n\n"}

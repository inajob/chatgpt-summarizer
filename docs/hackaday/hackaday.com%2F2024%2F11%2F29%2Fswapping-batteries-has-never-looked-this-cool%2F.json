Watch it in action, itll explain itself.\nBefore 3D printers made it onto hobbyist workbenches, prototyping something like this would have been much more work.\n[Kounotori_DIY] uses a small plastic linear guide as an interface for an 18650 battery holder and as you can see, its pretty slick. A little cylindrical container slides out of the assembly, allowing a spent cell to drop out. Loading a freshly charged cell consists of just popping a new one into the cylinder, then snapping it closed. The electrical connection is made by two springy metal tabs on either end that fit into guides in the cylindrical holder.\nIts just a prototype right now, and [Kounotori_DIY] admits that the assembly is still a bit big and theres no solid retention  a good bump will pop the battery out  but we think this is onto something. We cant help but imagine how swapping batteries in such style with a nice solid click would go very nicely on a cyberdeck build.\nIts not every day that someone tries to re-imagine a battery holder, let alone with such style. Any ideas how it could be improved? Have your own ideas about reimagining how batteries are handled? Let us know in the comments!\n\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ssstwitter.com_1732825429623.mp4", "title": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a18650\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "[Kounotori_DIY]\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u5f0f\u3067\u4ea4\u63db\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6539\u826f\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a18650\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4ea4\u63db\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Kounotori_DIY\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4ea4\u63db\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u518d\u8003\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u3068\u63d0\u6848\u52df\u96c6"]}

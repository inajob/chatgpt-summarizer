For that curio cabinet-worthy appeal, you need to look a bit further back. Say, about 150 years. Yes, thatll do. A Crookes tube, the original electron beam-forming vacuum tube of glass, invented by Sir William Crookes et al. in the late 19th century, is what you need.\nAnd a Crookes tube is what [Markus Bindhammer] found on AliExpress one day. He felt that piece of historic lab equipment was asking to be put on display in proper fashion. So he set to work crafting a wooden stand for it out of a repurposed candlestick, a nice piece of scrap oak, and some brass feet giving it that antique mad-scientist feel.\nAfter connecting a high voltage generator and switch, the Crookes tube should have been all set, but nothing happened when it was powered up.\u00a0It turned out that a capacitance issue was preventing the tube from springing to life. Wrapping the cathode end of the tube in aluminum foil, [Markus] formed what is effectively a Leyden jar, and that was the trick that kicked things into action.\nAs of this writing, there are no longer any Crookes tubes that we could find on AliExpress, so youll have to look elsewhere if youre interested in showing off your own 19th century electron-streaming experiment. Check out the Crookes Radiometer for some more of Sir Williams Crookess science inside blown glass.\n\n"}

Unlike many Logitech mice, this one doesnt include a Unifying receiver, though its capable of pairing to one. Instead, it comes with a pre-paired CU0019 receiver that, it turns out, is based on a fairly obscure TC32 chipset by Telink, the kind weve seen in cheap smart wristbands. If youre dealing with a similarly obscure MCU, how do you even proceed?\nIn this case, GitHub had a good few tools developed by other hackers earlier  a Ghidra integration, and a tool for working with the MCU using a USB-UART and a single resistor. Unfortunately, dumping memory through the MCUs interface was unreliable and frustrating. So it was time to celebrate when fuzzing the HID endpoints uncovered a memory dump exploit, with the memory dumper code helpfully shared in the blog post.\nFrom a memory dump, the exploration truly began  [endes0] uncovers a fair bit of dongles inner workings, including a guess on which project it was based on, and even a command putting the dongle into a debug mode where a TC32-compatible debugger puts this dongle fully under your control.\nYet another hands-on course on Ghidra, and a wonderful primer on mouse dongle hacking  after all, if you treat your mouses dongle as a development platform, you can easily do things like controlling a small quadcopter, or pair the dongle with a SNES gamepad, or build a nifty wearable.", "title": "USB HID\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u5165\u9580\uff1aLogitech M185\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306eUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u89e3\u6790", "body": "[endes0]\u3055\u3093\u306f\u6700\u8fd1USB HID\u3067\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30ed\u30b8\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306eM185\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306eUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002GitHub\u3067\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3001\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001TC32\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u5b66\u3073\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["USB HID\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u5165\u9580\uff1aLogitech M185\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306eUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u89e3\u6790", "\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u306b\u8f1d\u304f\uff1aUSB-UART\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMCU\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30a4\u30c8", "Ghidra\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3066\uff1aUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306eUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3057\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306eUSB\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc: \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

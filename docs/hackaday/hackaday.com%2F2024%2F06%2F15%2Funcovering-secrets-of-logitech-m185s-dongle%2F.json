Unlike many Logitech mice, this one doesnt include a Unifying receiver, though its capable of pairing to one. Instead, it comes with a pre-paired CU0019 receiver that, it turns out, is based on a fairly obscure TC32 chipset by Telink, the kind weve seen in cheap smart wristbands. If youre dealing with a similarly obscure MCU, how do you even proceed?\nIn this case, GitHub had a good few tools developed by other hackers earlier  a Ghidra integration, and a tool for working with the MCU using a USB-UART and a single resistor. Unfortunately, dumping memory through the MCUs interface was unreliable and frustrating. So it was time to celebrate when fuzzing the HID endpoints uncovered a memory dump exploit, with the memory dumper code helpfully shared in the blog post.\nFrom a memory dump, the exploration truly began  [endes0] uncovers a fair bit of dongles inner workings, including a guess on which project it was based on, and even a command putting the dongle into a debug mode where a TC32-compatible debugger puts this dongle fully under your control.\nYet another hands-on course on Ghidra, and a wonderful primer on mouse dongle hacking  after all, if you treat your mouses dongle as a development platform, you can easily do things like controlling a small quadcopter, or pair the dongle with a SNES gamepad, or build a nifty wearable."}

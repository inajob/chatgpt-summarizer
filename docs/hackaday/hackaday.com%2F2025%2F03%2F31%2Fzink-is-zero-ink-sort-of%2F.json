If you happen to think of a thermal printer, we bet you think of something like a receipt printer: fast and monochrome. But in the last few decades, theres been a family of niche printers designed to print snapshots in color using thermal technology. Some of them are built into cameras and some are about the size of a chunky cell phone battery, but they all rely on a Polaroid-developed technology for doing high-definition color printing known as Zink  a portmanteau of zero ink.\nFor whatever reason, these printers arent a household name even though theyve been around for a while. Yet, someone must be using them. You can buy printers and paper quite readily and relatively inexpensively. Recently, I saw an HP-branded Zink printer in action, and I wasnt expecting much. But I was stunned at the picture quality. Sure, it cant print a very large photo, but for little wallet-size snaps, it did a great job.\nThe Tech\nPolaroid was well known for making photographic paper with color layers used in instant photography. In the 1990s, the company was looking for something new. The Zink paper was the result. The paper has three layers of amorphochromic dyes. Initially, the dye is colorless, but will take on a particular color based on temperature.\nThe key to understanding the process is that you can control the temperature that will trigger a color change. The top layer of the paper requires high heat to change. The printer uses a very short pulse, so that the top layer will turn yellow, but the heat wont travel down past that top layer.\nThe middle layer  magenta  will change at a medium heat level. But to get that heat to the layer, the pulse has to be longer. The top layer, however, doesnt care because it never gets to the temperature that will cause it to turn yellow.\nThe bottom layer is cyan. This dye is set to take the lowest temperature of all, but since the bottom heats up slowly, it takes an even longer pulse at the lower temperature. The top two layers, again, dont matter since they wont get hot enough to change. A researcher involved in the project likened the process to fried ice cream. You fry the coating at a high temperature for a short time to avoid melting the ice cream. Or you can wait, and the ice cream will melt without affecting the coating.\n\nThe pulses range from about 500 microseconds for yellow up to 10 milliseconds for cyan. The dyes need to not erroneously react to, say, sunlight, so the temperature targets ranged from 100 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C. A solvent melts at the right temperature and causes the dye to change color. So, technically, the dye doesnt change color with heating. The solvent causes it to change color, and the heat releases the solvent.\nIt works well, as you can see in the short clip below. Theres no audio, but the printer does make a little grinding noise as it prints:\n\nThe History\nZink started as research from Polaroid. The companys instant film used color dyes that diffuse up to the surface unless blocked by a photosensitive chemical. The problem is that diffusion is difficult to control, so they were interested in finding another alternative.\nChemists at Polaroid had the idea of using a colorless chemical until exposed to light. They would eventually give up in the 1980s, but revisited the idea in the 1990s when digital photography started eroding their market share.\nOne program designed to save the company was to build a portable printer, and the earlier research on colorless dyes came back around. Thermal print heads were already available. You only needed a paper showing different colors based on some property the print head could control.\nThe team had success in the early 2000s. A 2 x 3 print required 200 million pulses of heat, but the results were impressive, although not quite as good as they needed to be for a commercial device. Unfortunately, in 2001, Polaroid filed for bankruptcy. The company changed hands a few times until the new owner decided it was too expensive to continue researching the new printer technology.\nA New Hope\nThe people driving the project knew they had to find a buyer for the technology if they wanted to continue. Many companies were interested in a finished product, but not as interested in a prototype.\nThey were using a modified but existing thermal printer from Alps to demonstrate the technology, and when they showed it to Alps, they immediately signed on as a partner to make the hardware. This was enough to persuade an investor to step up and pull the company out of what was left of Polaroid.\nCalibration\nOf course, there were trials, but the new company, Zink Imaging, managed to roll out a commercially viable product. One problem solved was dealing with the slightly different paper between batches. The answer was to have each pack of paper have a barcode on the first sheet that the printer uses to calibrate itself.\nZinks business model involves selling the paper it makes. It licenses its technology to companies like Polaroid, Dell, Kodak, and HP, which then have the usual manufacturing partners build the printers. Search your favorite retailer for zink printer and youll find plenty of options. The 2 x 3 paper is still popular, although you can get 4 x 6 printers, too.\nOf course, saying it is inkless isnt really true. The ink is in the paper and, as you might expect, the paper isnt that cheap. On the other hand, inkjet ink is also expensive, and you dont have to worry about a printer clogging up if it is unused for a few months.\nMore\nOne of many internal photos in the FCC filing\nWhile Skymall no longer sells from airplanes, their YouTube channel shows a high-level view of how the printer works in a video, which you can see below.\nIf you were hoping for a teardown, check out the FCC filings to find plenty of internal pictures (weve mentioned how to do this before).\nWe are always surprised these arent more common. Do you have one of these printers? Let us know in the comments. The best use weve seen of one of these was in a fake Polaroid camera. If you really want nostalgic photography, break out your 3D printer.\n"}

We were drawn to [Max Pflaum]s ESP32 Dashboard as a great example, its an ESP32 hooked up to an e-paper display. The hardware is simple enough, but the software is what makes it interesting.\nThis is deigned as a configurable notification tool, so to make it bend to the users will a series of widgets can be loaded onto it. The device runs MicroPython, making it easy enough to write more than the ones already on place. The screen is divided into four zones, allowing for a range of widgets to be used at once. All the details can be found in a GitHub repository.\nWe like it for its configurability and ease of programming, and because it delivers well on the promise of a useful device. An ESP32 and e-ink combination with MicroPython apps is something weve seen before in the world of badges."}

In the US, push-back from lawmakers  no doubt spurred by radio industry lobbyists  has put the brakes on the move a bit, on the understandable grounds that an entire emergency communication system largely centered around AM radio has been in place for the last seven decades or so. Not so in Japan, though, as thirteen of the nations 47 broadcasters have voluntarily shut down their AM transmitters in whats billed as an impact study by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The request for the study actually came from the broadcasters, with one being quoted in a hearing on the matter as hop[ing] that AM broadcasting will be promptly discontinued. So the writing is apparently on the wall for AM radio in Japan.\n\nThere was another close call this week with our increasingly active sun, which tried but didnt quite launch a massive stream of plasma out into space. The M-class flare was captured in the act by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, which keeps an eye on whats going on with our star. The video of the outburst is fascinating; it almost looks like a CGI render, but its real imaging and pretty spectacular. The active region on the suns surface suddenly belches out a few gigatons of plasma, which quickly get sucked right back down to the surface. You can actually see the material following ethereal lines of magnetic force, and the way it splashes when it hits the surface is just beautiful. Seeing this puts us in the mood for a feature on the SDO and how it gets these fascinating images, so stay tuned for that.\nAlso in space news, were saddened by the sudden loss of yet another of the Apollo astronauts. Bill Anders, lunar module pilot on Apollo 8, died Friday in a small plane crash off San Juan Island in Washington. Anders, 90, was piloting the Beechcraft T-34 Mentor, a single-engine military trainer aircraft from the 1950s. Anders only trip in space was Apollo 8, but what a trip it was. Along with Commander Frank Borman and pilot James Lovell, they were the first humans to leave Earths gravity well and visit another world, riding the mighty Saturn V rocket all the way to the Moon for a ten-orbit visit that paved the way for the landing on Apollo 11. He is also officially the luckiest photographer in history, having been in just the right place at just the right time to snap the famous Earthrise picture that gave us for the first time a Moons-eye-view of our fragile little world:\n\n\n\nGodspeed, Major General Anders.\nIn more mundane news, a story from Maryland that should give anyone who depends on tools for a living a moments pause. Police cracked a massive tool-theft ring thanks to the actions of a carpenter who, sick of having his tools ripped off repeatedly, stashed a couple of AirTags among his stock in trade. When the inevitable occurred and his tools took a walk yet again, he tracked them to a storage facility and alerted police. They in turn conducted an investigation and got search warrants for twelve locations, where the scale of this criminal enterprise became apparent. Check out the photos in the story; mountains of cordless tools sorted by brand, DeWalt yellow here and Milwaukee red there. Theres a surprising amount of puke-green Ryobi, too; are people really trying to make money with those tools? Between the piles of cordless tools and the rows of air compressors, the total value of the haul is estimated to be from $3 to $5 million. Hats off to the carpenter for running his own mini-sting operation.\nAnd finally, from the Genuinely Interesting Apps files we have ShadeMap, which does exactly what you think it does: plot shade and shadow on a map. It has controls for time and date, and zooms down to a pretty fine level of detail, even for the free version. Shadows from buildings, terrain, and trees are calculated and displayed, making it perfect for surveys of locations for solar power installations. Theres also supposed to be a way to virtually remove shadow-casting features, although we couldnt find it; perhaps in a paid version? That would be a handy tool indeed to see which trees need to be cut down or which buildings demolished to improve your solar aspect. YMMV on that last one, of course.", "title": "EV\u8eca\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u4f34\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u306eAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3078", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304cAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u5ec3\u6b62\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u7c73\u56fd\u3067\u306f\u8b70\u54e1\u3089\u304c\u53cd\u5bfe\u3002\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306f47\u306e\u653e\u9001\u5c40\u306e\u3046\u306113\u304cAM\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u505c\u6b62\u3057\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u7701\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u8abf\u67fb\u5b9f\u65bd\u3002\u592a\u967d\u6d3b\u52d5\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Beachcraft\u6a5f\u4e8b\u6545\u3067Apollo8\u306e\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8Bill Anders\u304c\u6b7b\u53bb\u3002 Maryland\u306e\u5de5\u5177\u76d7\u96e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3082\u8a71\u984c\u3002ShadeMap\u306f\u65e5\u9670\u3092\u5730\u56f3\u4e0a\u306b\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3002", "titles": ["EV\u8eca\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u4f34\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u306eAM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u304c\u7d42\u4e86\u3078", "\u592a\u967d\u306eM\u7d1a\u30d5\u30ec\u30a2\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3001SDO\u304c\u77ac\u9593\u3092\u64ae\u5f71", "\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed8\u53f7\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u30d3\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u5c0f\u578b\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u4e8b\u6545\u3067\u6b7b\u4ea1", "\u5de5\u5177\u76d7\u96e3\u306e\u4e00\u5927\u7d44\u7e54\uff1a\u30e1\u30ea\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u5dde\u3067\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u76d7\u96e3\u5de5\u5177\u304c\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u8a2d\u5099\u306e\u5834\u6240\u8abf\u67fb\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064ShadeMap\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u767b\u5834"]}

[Proper Printing] didnt just think it, hes made a working hot glue 3D printer. As youd expect, its the extruder which forms the hack here.\nA Dremel hot glue gun supplies the hot end, whose mains heater cartridge is replaced with a low voltage one with he help of a piece of brass tube. He already has his own design for an extruder for larger diameters, so he mates this with the hot end. Finally the nozzle is tapped with a thread to fit an airbrush nozzle for printing, and hes ready tp print. With a much lower temperature and an unheated bed it extrudes, but it takes multiple attempts and several redesigns of the mechanical parts of the extruder before he finally ended up with the plastic shell of the glue gun as part of the assembly.\nThe last touch is a glue stick magazine that drops new sticks into a funnel on top of the extruder, and its printing a Benchy. At this point you might be asking why go to all this effort, but when you consider that there are other interesting materials which are only available in stick form its clear that this goes beyond the glue. If youre up for more hot glue gun oddities meanwhile, in the past weve shown you the opposite process to this one.\n\n", "title": "\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "body": "\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52a0\u71b1\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc3D\u5370\u5237", "\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "Dremel\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u6750\u6599\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

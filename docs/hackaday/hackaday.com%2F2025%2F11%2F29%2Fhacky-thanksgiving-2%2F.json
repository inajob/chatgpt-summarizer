But it\u2019s also when we think about what we\u2019ve been grateful for over the past year. And here at Hackaday, that\u2019s you all: the people out there making the crazy projects that we get the pleasure of writing about, and those of you just reading along. After all, we\u2019re just the hackers in the middle. You are all Hackaday.\nAnd it\u2019s also the time of year, at least in this hemisphere, when the days get far too short for their own good and the weather gets frankly less than pleasant. That means more time indoors, and if we play our cards right, more time in the lab. Supercon is over and Hackaday Europe is still far enough in the future. Time for a good project along with all of the festive duties.\nSo here we sit, while the weather outside is frightful, wishing you all a pleasant start to the holiday season. May your parts bin overflow and your projects-to-do-list never empty!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks. It also includes our favorite articles from the last seven days that you can see on the web version of the newsletter.\n\nWant this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning?

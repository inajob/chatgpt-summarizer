It was just a bunch of simple animations on a monochrome LCD, but it had heart, and people responded to that. Modern technology is capable of so much more, so [CiferTech] set out to build a virtual pet that can sniff out WiFi networks.\nThe build employs an ESP32-S3, perhaps the worlds favorite microcontroller that has WiFi baked right in from the factory. Its paired with a 240240 TFT LCD that delivers bright, vivid colors to show the digital pet living inside. Addressable WS2812B LEDs and a simple sound engine provide further feedback on the pets status.\nThe pet has various behaviors coded in, like hunting, exploring, and resting, and moods such as happy, curious, and bored. For a bit of environmental reactivity, [CiferTech] also made the local WiFi environment play a role. Nearby networks can influence the hunger, happiness, and health of the pet.\nIncidentally, if youve ever wondered what made the Tamagotchi tick, weve explored that before, too.\n\n"}

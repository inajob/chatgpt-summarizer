It was just a bunch of simple animations on a monochrome LCD, but it had heart, and people responded to that. Modern technology is capable of so much more, so [CiferTech] set out to build a virtual pet that can sniff out WiFi networks.\nThe build employs an ESP32-S3, perhaps the worlds favorite microcontroller that has WiFi baked right in from the factory. Its paired with a 240240 TFT LCD that delivers bright, vivid colors to show the digital pet living inside. Addressable WS2812B LEDs and a simple sound engine provide further feedback on the pets status.\nThe pet has various behaviors coded in, like hunting, exploring, and resting, and moods such as happy, curious, and bored. For a bit of environmental reactivity, [CiferTech] also made the local WiFi environment play a role. Nearby networks can influence the hunger, happiness, and health of the pet.\nIncidentally, if youve ever wondered what made the Tamagotchi tick, weve explored that before, too.\n\n", "title": "- WiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u611f\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "CiferTech\u304cWiFi\u3092\u611f\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002ESP32-S3\u3068\u30ab\u30e9\u30fcLCD\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u884c\u52d5\u3084\u611f\u60c5\u8868\u73fe\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- WiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u611f\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- ESP32-S3\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 240x240 TFT LCD\u3067\u8868\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u74b0\u5883\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u3068\u611f\u60c5\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u9032\u5316\u7248\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u904a\u3076\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

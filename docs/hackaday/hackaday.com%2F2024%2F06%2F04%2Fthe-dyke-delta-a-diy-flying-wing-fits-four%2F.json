Built to copy some of the 1950s era innovations in delta-style jet aircraft, the plane is essentially a flying wing that seats four.\nAnd its not just all good looks: people who have flown them say theyre very gentle, they get exceptional gas mileage, and the light wing-loading means that they can land at a mellow 55 miles per hour (88 kph). And did we mention the wings fold up so you can store it in your garage?\nWant to build your own? [John] still sells the plans. But dont jump into this without testing the water first  the frame is entirely hand-welded and he estimates it takes between 4,000 and 5,000 hours to build. Its a labor of love. Still, the design is time-tested, and over 50 of the planes have been built from the blueprints. Just be sure to adhere to the specs carefully!\nIts really fun to see how far people can push aerodynamics, and how innovative the experimental airplane scene really is. The JD-2 was (and probably still is!) certainly ahead of its time, and if we all end up in flying wings in the future, maybe this plane wont look so oddball after all.\n\n", "title": "60\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u98db\u884c\u7ffc\u306eJD-2 Dyke Delta", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b[John Dyke]\u304c\u8a2d\u8a08\u30fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305fJD-2 Dyke Delta\u306f\u3001\u76ee\u3092\u5f15\u304f\u98db\u884c\u7ffc\u30674\u4eba\u4e57\u308a\u3002\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u52b9\u7387\u3082\u826f\u304f\u3001\u7740\u9678\u901f\u5ea6\u308255 mph\uff0888 kph\uff09\u3068\u4f4e\u901f\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u52b4\u529b\u304c\u8981\u308b\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13\u6a5f\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "titles": ["60\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u98db\u884c\u7ffc\u306eJD-2 Dyke Delta", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aJD-2 Dyke Delta\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30c9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u3001JD-2 Dyke Delta\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e\u4e16\u754c\uff1aJD-2 Dyke Delta\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u3055", "\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226\uff1aJD-2 Dyke Delta\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

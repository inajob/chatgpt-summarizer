The truck is equipped with four proximity sensors, one front, one front left, one front right, and one rear. The sensor readings from the truck are transmitted to the artificial brain which determines which way to turn and whether to go forward or backward. The inputs to each neuron, the synapses, can be excitatory to increase the firing rate or inhibitory to decrease the firing rate. The output commands are then returned wirelessly to the truck via a hacked remote control.\nThis particular type of neural network is called a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) which uses discrete events, called spikes, instead of continuous real-valued activations. In these types of networks when a neuron fires matters as well as the strength of the signal. There are other videos on this channel which go into more depth on these topics.\nThe name of this experimental vehicle is the GSN SNN 4-8-24-2 Autonomous Vehicle, which is short for: Global Science Network Spiking Neural Network 4 Inputs 8 Neurons 24 Synapses 2 Degrees of Freedom Output. The circuitry on both the vehicle and the breadboards is littered with LEDs which give some insight into how it all functions.\nIf youre interested in how neural networks can control behavior you might like to see a digital squids behavior shaped by a neural network.\n\n", "title": "\u4eba\u5de5\u8133\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308bRC\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u3067RC\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\uff18\u3064\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3\u3067\u81ea\u5f8b\u8d70\u884c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u4eba\u5de5\u8133\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308bRC\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u81ea\u5f8b\u8d70\u884c", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u304c\u64cd\u308b\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af", "\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7d4c\u56de\u8def\u306e\u878d\u5408\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2", "GSN SNN 4-8-24-2 \u81ea\u5f8b\u578b\u30d3\u30fc\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

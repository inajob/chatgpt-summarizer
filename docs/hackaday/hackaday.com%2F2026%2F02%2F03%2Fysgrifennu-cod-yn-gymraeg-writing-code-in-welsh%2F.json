Its particularly obvious in the world of programming languages, where English-derived language and syntax rules the roost.\nIts always IF foo THEN bar, and\u00a0 never SI foo ALORS bar. It is now possible to do something akin to OS foo YNA bar though, because [Richard Hainsworth] has created y Ddraig (the Dragon), a programming language using Welsh language as syntax. (The Welsh double D, Dd is pronounced something like an English soft th as in their)\nUnder the hood its not an entirely new language, instead its a Welsh localisation of the Raku language. A localisation file is created, that can as we understand it handle bidirectional transcription between languages. The write-up goes into detail about the process.\nThere will inevitably be people asking what the point of a programming language for a spoken language with under a million native speakers is, so its worth taking a look at that head on. Its important for Welsh education and the Welsh tech sector because a a geeky kid in a Welsh-medium school Pwllheli deserves to code just as much as an English kid in a school near Oxford, but it goes far beyond Welsh alone. There are many languages and cultures across the world where English is not widely spoken, and every single one of them has those kids like us who pick up a computer and run with it. The more of them that can learn to code, and thrive without having the extra burden of knowing English, the better. Perhaps in a couple of decades well be using code from people who learned this way, without our ever knowing it.\nAs your scribe, this needs to be added: Maen ddrwg gyda fi ffrendiau Cymraeg, mae Cymraeg i yn wael iawn. Dwin d\u00f4d or Rhydychen, ni Pwllheli.\n\nHeader image: Jeff Buck, CC BY-SA 2.0."}

(Credit: TommyB, YouTube)\nBuilding your own handheld gaming console has been a popular project for many years, but recently it has become significantly easier to get a lot of power into a small package. Like many others, [TommyB] made his own Raspberry Pi SBC-based handheld in the past, which results in a rather bulky and underpowered package. A more performant solution would be to stuff laptop guts into a handheld case, but until Framework came onto the scene this wasnt easy and would get you a sloppy one-off solution. With [TommyB]s current handheld project he uses a standard Framework laptop mainboard, along with the official battery to get a very capable gaming system.\nGetting the ergonomics and fit for the components just right took many tries, but eventually a prototype shell was designed that fits the Framework mainboard, the battery, twin Framework speakers, an 8 LCD panel from Waveshare (connected via USB-C to HDMI) and mechanical switches for the buttons. These switches connect to an RP2040-based board that runs the GP2040-CE firmware, allowing the operating system to detect it as an XBox controller. Although still far from finished, it shows just how beneficial standard laptop parts are, with a massive gap in the market where Framework could make its own handheld shell available. Were looking forward to [TommyB] demonstrating the finished version of his Framework handheld, and the inevitable upgrade from the 11th-gen Intel mainboard to one of the sparkling new mainboards with even better specs.\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u307b\u307c\u6700\u7d42\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u300d", "body": "\u624b\u6301\u3061\u578b\u306eFramework\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u307b\u307c\u6700\u7d42\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3002\u643a\u5e2f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u9803\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002[TommyB]\u6c0f\u306fFramework\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u307b\u307c\u6700\u7d42\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u300d", "\u300c\u6a19\u6e96\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u300d", "\u300cGP2040-CE\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fXbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u300d", "\u300c\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d", "\u300c\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u300d"]}

When [Skye] was looking at the current state of connected pH meters they realized there was incredible room for improvement.\nCalled the Nectar Monitor, this pH meter is a more modern take on what is currently offered in this space. Open source and based on the ESP32, its accessible to most people with a soldering iron, fits into a standard project box, and includes other modern features like USB and WiFi connectivity. It can even measure conductivity and temperature. But the main improvement here is that unlike other monitors that can only be submerged temporarily, this one is designed to be under water for long time periods thanks to a specially designed probe and electrical isolation.\nThis design makes it an appealing choice for people with aquariums, hydroponic farms, or any other situation where constant monitoring of pH is extremely important to maintaining a balanced system. Weve seen some unique takes on hydroponics before especially, including this build that moves the plants instead of the nutrient solution and this fully automated indoor garden.", "title": "- \u6700\u65b0\u306epH\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044pH\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cNectar Monitor\u300d\u306f\u3001ESP32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u9577\u671f\u6d78\u6c34\u53ef\u80fd\u3002USB\u30fbWiFi\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u3001\u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u3084\u6c34\u8015\u683d\u57f9\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6700\u65b0\u306epH\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "- ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u6c34\u4e2d\u3067\u9577\u671f\u9593\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306apH\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u7279\u9577", "- \u6c34\u8cea\u7ba1\u7406\u306b\u6700\u9069\uff01\u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u3084\u6c34\u8015\u683d\u57f9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- USB\u304a\u3088\u3073WiFi\u63a5\u7d9a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb"]}

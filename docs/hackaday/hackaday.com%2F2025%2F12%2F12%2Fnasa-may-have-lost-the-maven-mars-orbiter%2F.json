Unfortunately, the Deep Space Network hasnt heard from the science orbiter since. Engineers are currently trying to troubleshoot this issue, but without a sign of life from the stricken spacecraft, there are precious few options.\nAs noted by [Stephen Clark] over at\u00a0ArsTechnica this is a pretty big deal. Even though MAVEN was launched in November of 2013, its a spring chicken compared to the other Mars orbiters. The two other US orbiters: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Odyssey, are significantly older by around a decade. Of the two ESA orbiters, Mars Express and ExoMars, the latter is fairly new (2016) and could at least be a partial backup for MAVENs communication relay functionality with the ground-based units, in particular the two active rovers. ExoMars has a less ideal orbit for large data transfers, which would hamper scientific research.\nWith neither the Chinese nor UAE orbiters capable of serving as a relay, this puts the burden on a potential replacement orbiter, such as the suggested Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, which was cancelled in 2005. Even if contact with MAVEN is restored, it would only have fuel for a few more years. This makes a replacement essential if we wish to keep doing ground-based science missions on Mars, as well as any potential manned missions.", "title": "- MAVEN\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u3001\u706b\u661f\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u55aa\u5931", "body": "MAVEN\u885b\u661f\u304c\u706b\u661f\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u5931\u3044\u3001\u9023\u7d61\u4e0d\u660e\u306b\u3002\u9577\u671f\u7684\u306a\u901a\u4fe1\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- MAVEN\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u3001\u706b\u661f\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3067\u4fe1\u53f7\u55aa\u5931", "- \u5730\u7403\u306e\u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3001MAVEN\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9023\u7d61\u304c\u9014\u7d76\u3048\u305f\u7406\u7531", "- \u706b\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u3001MAVEN\u306e\u6545\u969c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "- MAVEN\u306e\u5f8c\u7d99\u6a5f\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f", "- \u706b\u661f\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u6697\u96f2\u3001MAVEN\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

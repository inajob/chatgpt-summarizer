It was great to see everyone, and meet a whole bunch of new folks to boot! The talks were great, and you can see a good half of them already on the Hackaday YouTube channel, so for that you didn\u2019t even have to be there.\nThe badge hacks were, as with most years, out of this world. I\u2019ll admit that my cheeks were sore from laughing so much after emceeing it this year, due in no small part to two hilarious AI projects, both of which were also righteous hacks in addition to full-on comedy routines. A group of six programmers got all of their hacks working together, and the I2C-to-MQTT bridge had badges blinking in sync even in the audience. You want blinkies? We had blinkies.\nBut the hack that warmed everyones\u2019 hearts was \u201cI figured it out\u201d by [Connie]. Before this weekend, she had never coded MicroPython and didn\u2019t know anything about I2C. But yet by Sunday afternoon, she made a sweet spiral animation on the LED wheel, and blinked the RGBs in the touchwheel.\nWhat I love about the Hackaday audience is that, when the chips are down, someone doing something new for the first time is valued as much as some of the more showy work done by more experienced programmers. Hacking is also about learning and pushing out boundaries after all. The shouts for \u201cI figured it out\u201d were louder than any others in the graphics hacks category, it took home a prize, and I was smiling from ear to ear.\nHackaday can learn from this too. [Connie]\u2019s hack definitely shows the need for another badge-hack category, first timers, because we absolutely should recognize first tries. There was also a strong petition / protest from people who had worked new hacks onto previous year\u2019s badges \u2013 like [Andy] and [Cope]s addition of bit-banged I2C to the Voja 4 badge from two years ago, and [Instant Arcade]\u2019s Polar Pacman, which he named \u201cIneligible for this Competition\u201d in protest. Touche.\nWere stoked to learn new things, see new hacks, and basically just catch up with everything folks did over the weekend. We cant wait to see what youre up to next year!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

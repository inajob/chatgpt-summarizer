We find that last attribute to be a big part of its charm, but thats not to say an electronic version of the classic toy cant be pretty cool, especially when its done without the aid of a microcontroller.\nThis is one of those because I can projects that we always find so interesting, and more so because it wasnt entirely clear to [BigZaphod] that he had the skills to pull it off. While his initial design centered around a bunch of 88 LED matrix displays and a 2564-bit RAM chip, the rest of it was a lot of hand-waving. After a few experiments with addressing the LEDs, [Zaphod] started filling in the blanks with a refresh circuit using a 555  naturally  and a pair of counters. Properly debounced encoders for the horizontal and vertical controls came next, along with more counters to track the cursor and a host of other circuits that ended up looking like a one of each selection from the 7400-series catalog.\nWhile we do wish for a schematic on this one, its still a pretty enjoyable video, and the end product seems to work really well. The electronic version has a few features the original lacks, such as wrapping the cursor to the other side of the screen. Wed imagine that the buttons on the encoders could be put to work, too; perhaps a click could make it so you can move the cursor without leaving a trail behind. That might be a challenge to execute in logic, but then again, that was the point of the whole thing.\nStill jonesing for that mechanical Etch-A-Sketch experience? Not a problem.\n\n"}

The preceding period, Advent, was traditionally a fast, not unlike Lent. When and why a fast became an excuse for chocolate calendars we cannot say, but this historical information is presented to explain that this great hack by [Kevin], making a vintage speech synthesizer chip sing the classic carol will remain relevant at least until January 5th  or perhaps even the 19th, for the Orthodox amongst us.\nThe chip in question is an SP0256A-AL2, which you may remember from various speech projects for 8-bit computers back in the day. It can talk, after a fashion, by reproducing 56 allophones  the sounds that make up English speech  from ROM. Singing, though? We cannot recall much of that back in the day, but then, a talking computer was impressive enough.\nAs it turns out this is building on an earlier hack [Kevin] did in which he used an Arduino to make the venerable speech chip MIDI controllable. In that projects write-up it is revealed that a Si5351 programmable clock module is used to give a variable pitch signal to the speech synthesizer. In this way hes able to get about an octave an a half, which is good enough when the carol in question only spans one octave.\nOf course the pitch signal needs to be varied by something and for that the venerable Arduino once again takes the place of an 8-bit computer. In this case its pre-programmed, but can also be set up for MIDI control.Of course nothing says you cant use true retro hardware or a more-capable RP2040 instead of the Amtel chip.\nIts sad to think how much compute power has been wasted this year on AI-generated novelty carols when a little bit of 1980s silicon and some ingenuity can do nearly as good  or better, depending on your tastes.\n"}

We know how it is \u2013 we are fully licensed procrastineers ourselves. So with an eye toward tradition, we\u2019re extending the Call for Speakers and the Call for Workshops one more week, until July 16th.\nThe Hackaday Superconference is really and truly our favorite event of the year. It\u2019s small, but not too small. The ideas everyone brings with them, however, are big. It\u2019s like the absolute best of Hackaday live and in person. If you\u2019re looking for a place to give a technical talk, or just to regale us all with the trials and triumphs of hacking, you won\u2019t find a more receptive audience anywhere. Plus, presenters get in free.\nIn other news, [Voja] has an alpha version of the badge finished, so all that\u2019s left is 90% of the work disguised as 10%. Some people have asked for clues, and what we\u2019ll say at this point is that \u201cSimple Add Ons have underutilized I2C pins\u201d.\nExpect tickets to go on sale in the next weeks \u2013 early bird tickets sell out fast. Keep your eyes on Hackaday for the announcement post when it goes live. Or, you can skip straight to the front of the line by giving a talk. But you can\u2019t give a talk if you don\u2019t submit your proposal first. Get on it now, because we\u2019re not going to extend the CFP twice!"}

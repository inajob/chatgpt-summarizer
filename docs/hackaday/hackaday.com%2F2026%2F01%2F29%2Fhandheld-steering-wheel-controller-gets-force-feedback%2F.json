These steering wheels often have force feedback, with a small motor inside that can provide resistance to a users input that feels the same way that a steering wheel on a real car would. Inexpensive or small joysticks often omit this feature, but [Jason] has figured out a way to bring this to even the smallest game controllers.\nThe mechanism at the center of his controller is a DC motor out of an inkjet printer. Inkjet printers have a lot of these motors paired with rotary encoders for precision control, which is exactly what is needed here. A rotary encoder can determine the precise position of the controllers wheel, and the motor can provide an appropriate resistive force depending on what is going on in the game. The motors out of a printer arent plug-and-play, though. They also need an H-bridge so they can get driven in either direction, and the entire mechanism is connected to an Arduino in the base of the controller to easily communicate with a computer over USB.\nIn testing the controller does behave like its larger, more expensive cousins, providing feedback to the driver and showing that its ready for ones racing game of choice. Its an excellent project for those who are space-constrained or who like to game on the go, but if you have more space available you might also want to check out [Jason]s larger version built from a power drill instead parts from an inkjet.\n\n"}

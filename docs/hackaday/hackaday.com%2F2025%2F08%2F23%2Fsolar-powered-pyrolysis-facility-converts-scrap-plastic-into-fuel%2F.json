According to the video, this is the worlds most complex hand-made pyrolysis reactor ever made. We will give him some wiggle room there around complex and hand-made, because whatever else you have to say about it this machine is incredibly cool!\nAs you may know pyrolysis is a process wherein heat is applied to organic material in an inert environment (such as a vacuum) which causes the separation of its covalent bonds thereby causing it to decompose. In this case we decompose scrap plastic into what it was made from: natural gas and petroleum.\nHis facility is one hundred percent solar powered. The battery is a 100 kWh Komodo commercial power tank. He has in the order of twenty solar power panels laying in the grass behind the facility giving him eight or nine kilowatts. The first step in using the machine, after turning it on, is to load scrap plastic into it; this is done by means of a vacuum pump attached to a large flexible tube. The plastic gets pumped through the top chamber into the bottom chamber, which contains blades that help move the plastic through it. The two chambers are isolated by a valve  operating it allows either chamber to be pumped down to vacuum independently.\nOnce the plastic is in the main vacuum chamber, the eight active magnetrons  the same type of device youd find in your typical microwave oven  begin to break down the plastic. As theres no air in the vacuum chamber, the plastic wont catch fire when it gets hot. Instead it melts, returning to petroleum and natural gas vapor which it was made from. Eventually the resultant vapor flows through a dephlegmator cooling into crude oil and natural gas which are stored separately for later use and further processing.\nIf youre interested in pyrolysis you might like to read Methane Pyrolysis: Producing Green Hydrogen Without Carbon Emissions.\n\n", "title": "- \u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u5ec3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u71c3\u6599\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u88c5\u7f6e", "body": "\u5ec3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u71c3\u6599\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u5ec3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u71c3\u6599\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30d4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u53cd\u5fdc\u5668\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u5ec3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5929\u7136\u30ac\u30b9\u3068\u77f3\u6cb9\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u74b0\u5883\u306b\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6e90\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30d4\u30ed\u30ea\u30b7\u30b9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

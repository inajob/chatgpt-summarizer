We never thought much about how\u00a0shokuhin sampuru  the Japanese name  were made until we watched [Process X]s video showing a 71-year-old artist creating food models. We arent sure what we  or you  would do with this information, but it is a striking process, and there must be something you could do with it. We suggest turning on the English captions, but youd probably enjoy watching the unusual craftsmanship even with no words.\nIn years past, the food models were primarily made from wax, but since the 1980s, it is more common to use polyvinyl chloride, silicone, and resin. While some factories produce items, sometimes with a mold, single craftsmen like the one in the video still make up the largest part of the market.\nWe arent sure, but we think the material in the video is wax. We couldnt help but think that some of this could have been 3D printed, but even with the finest resins and resolution, it probably wouldnt be quite as artistic. We think wax is mainly underutilized in todays tech. But there are some places it still shows up.\n\n"}

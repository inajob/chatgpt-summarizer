We left the project with all the parts put together to make a complete but unfinished shell that was very recognizable as a Computer Space cabinet but had neither finishing nor internals. Now were very pleased to bring you the conclusion of the project, as it moves from unfinished 3D print to playable cabinet.\nThe video below the break is a journey of print finishing to a very high standard with that lustrous blue glitter resin, but oddly its most interesting to find out about the manufacturing quirks of the original. How the rear door was imprecisely cut from plywood and fixed on with gate hinges, how the ventilation holes differ from cabinet to cabinet, and how the collection vessel for those quarters was an old tin. The monitor is a newer broadcast CRT in this version and the electronics are naturally\u00a0 modern, but if you didnt know, youd be hard pressed to spot that you werent playing the real thing.\nFinally we see the gameplay which is admittedly frustrating, and a little bit of punditry as to why this wasnt the commercial success of the following Pong. Its a fascinating look at the early computer game industry.\nHave a look at our coverage of the first episode of this project.\n\n", "title": "\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5b8c\u7d50", "body": "Computer Space\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5b8c\u7d50\u3002\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u3084\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u70b9\u3001\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u696d\u754c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u63cf\u304b\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5b8c\u7d50", "\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u5316", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u5149\u308b\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "\u672a\u6765\u3078\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u300cComputer Space\u300d\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab"]}

But what if you could rotate the whole image itself? [Jeri Ellsworth] has shown us how to achieve this with an amusing mechanical hack.\nThe trick behind this is simple. On a standard CRT, the deflection yoke uses magnetic coils to steer the electron beam in the X and Y axes, spraying electrons at the phosphors as needed. To rotate the display as a whole, you could do some complicated maths and change how you drive the coils and steer the electron beams or you could just rotate the entire yoke instead. [Jeri] achieves this by putting the whole deflection yoke on a custom slip ring assembly. This allows it to receive power and signal as it rotates around the neck of the tube, driven by a stepper motor.\nAmusingly, [Jeri] even found a super nifty way to drive the stepper. There are no microcontrollers or fancy driver logic here\u2014instead, the quadrature output from a rotary encoder outputs a perfectly legible pulse train which can drive the stepper as needed. [Jeri] notes this provides a nicely instantaneous response.\u00a0Theres still work to be done, too. The project is due to get a 3D-printed housing, a homing system, and some improvements to the DIY slip ring setup.\nIf [Jeris] name sounds familiar, thats because shes built many a grand project over the years. You might have seen her work on the C64 DTV or the breadbin keytar.\n\nI have big plans for spinny CRT\n Jeri Ellsworth (@jeriellsworth.bsky.social) 2026-01-05T10:42:52.953Z\n\n[Thanks to Neonsystem95 for the tip!]", "title": "- CRT\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "body": "Jeri Ellsworth\u306f\u3001CRT\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- CRT\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u7684\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- \u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308bCRT\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fCRT\u6620\u50cf\u56de\u8ee2\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "- \u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Jeri Ellsworth\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aCRT\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

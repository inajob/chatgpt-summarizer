Plus, it looks awesome.\nThe system, which is made up of a stacked pair of PCBs, has been designed to resemble an audio cassette. Thanks to the full-color silkscreen service offered by PCBway, it certainly looks the part. But its also a fully functional Arduboy, which means it has access to all the games already written for the 8-bit system.\n\nIt would have been impressive enough if this new handheld was just a classic Arduboy, but instead, [Kevin] made it a considerable upgrade over the version of the system thats already on the market. If you squint\u00a0just right, you might even catch a glimpse of what the future of the Arduboy might look like.\nFor one thing, the system features six capacitive touch pads for the directional and action buttons. This capability has been implemented by pairing each pad with its own dedicated touch IC, which means existing software doesnt have to be modified to take advantage of them. Its also got a 64 MB flash chip, which makes the 16 MB used in the Arduboy FX look likewell, a cassette tape. Under the hood theres also some new RGB LEDs, an IR transmitter, and a real-time clock. In a particularly clever move, Kevin has taken over a few pins of the USB-C connector and tied it to the chips I2C lines, which lets a standard USB-C cable link two of the handhelds together.\nThe finished product looks and works great, which has [Kevin] considering doing a small run of them so folks other than the FX Game Jam winners can get in on the action.\n"}

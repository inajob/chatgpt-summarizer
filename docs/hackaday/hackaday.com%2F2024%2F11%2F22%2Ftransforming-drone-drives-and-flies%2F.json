Now, [Michael Rechtin] has made the dream a bit more accessible with a 3D printed quadcopter that seamlessly transforms into a tracked ground vehicle.\nThe design tackles a critical engineering challenge: most multi-mode vehicles struggle with the vastly different rotational speeds required for flying and driving. [Michael]s solution involves using printed prop guards as wheels, paired with lightweight tracks. An extra pair of low-speed brushless motors are mounted between each wheel pair, driving the system via sprockets that engage directly with the same teeth that drive the tracks.\nThe transition magic happens through a four-bar linkage mounted in a parallelogram configuration, with a linear actuator serving as the bottom bar. To change from flying to driving configuration the linear actuator retracts, rotating the wheels/prop guards to a vertical position. A servo then rotates the top bar, lifting the body off the ground. While this approach adds some weight  an inevitable compromise in multi-purpose machines  it makes for a practical solution.\nPowering this transformer is a Teensy 4.0 flight controller running dRehmFlight, a hackable flight stabilization package weve seen successfully adapted for everything from VTOLs to actively stabilized hydrofoils. \n", "title": "- \u5f62\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u56db\u8f2a\u99c6\u52d5\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3", "body": "\u5f62\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u56db\u65cb\u5f8b\u8eca\u4e21\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u98db\u884c\u3068\u8d70\u884c\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5f62\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u56db\u8f2a\u99c6\u52d5\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3", "- \u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u5909\u5f62\u6280\u8853\uff01\u7a7a\u3068\u5730\u9762\u3092\u884c\u304d\u6765\u3059\u308b\u8eca\u4e21", "- \u591a\u7528\u9014\u8eca\u4e21\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u98db\u884c\u304b\u3089\u8d70\u884c\u3078\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048", "- \u8efd\u91cf\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30da\u30e9\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u878d\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u79fb\u52d5\u624b\u6bb5", "- Teensy 4.0\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u6280\u8853"]}

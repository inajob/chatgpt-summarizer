However, there is finally such a game for the platform, thanks to [Jakub Trznadel]\u2014and its called World of Spells.\nLike so many other games of this type, it was inspired by the 3D raycasting techniques made so popular by Wolfenstein 3D back in the day. For that reason, it has a very similar look in some regards, but a very different look in others\u2014the latter mostly due to the characteristic palette available on the ZX Spectrum. A playable FPS is quite a feat to achieve on such limited hardware, but [Jakub] pulled it off well, with the engine able to reach up to 80 frames per second.\n\nThe game is available for download, and you can even order it on tape if you so desire. You might also like to check out the walkthrough on YouTube, where the game is played on an emulator. Dont worry, though\u2014the game works on real ZX Spectrum 48k hardware just fine.\nThe Speccy retains a diehard fanbase to this day. You can even build a brand new one thanks to a buoyant supply of aftermarket parts.\n\n[thanks to losr for the tip!]\n"}

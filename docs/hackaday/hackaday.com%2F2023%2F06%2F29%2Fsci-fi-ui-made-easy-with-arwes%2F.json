Todays computer interfaces have certainly grown fancier since the Windows 3.1 and Mac System 7 days, but theyre still nowhere near that gorgeous. The Arwes framework aims to change that, at least where web apps are concerned.\nThe framework is inspired by the cyberprep and synthwave aesthetics, while drawing from media like TRON: Legacy and Halo. You can get a peek at what it can do on the Arwes website, or look at how it runs on sites like SoulExtract or the Cyber Movie Database. Its very much about glowing lines, 1980s computer sounds, and screens with animated text fills.\nIts still in an alpha release, and likely isnt yet ready for business-critical production use. It currently consists of a set of basic components that can be assembled into a functional futuristic website design, but youll need some experience to use the tools at hand. Theres a sandbox for experimenting that should help in that regard.\nYou might just find that its the perfect tool to create an interface for your very own cyberdeck, or you might put it to work on your next website design. Either way, if you create something fantastic, dont hesitate to drop us a line.\n"}

But wed never heard of the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector implosion until stumbling upon [Alexander the OK]s video of the 2001 event. The first half of the video below describes neutrinos in some detail and the engineering problems related to detecting and studying a particle so elusive that it can pass through the entire planet without hitting anything. The Super-Kamiokande detector was built to solve that problem, courtesy of an enormous tank of ultrapure water buried 1,000 meters inside a mountain in Japan and lined with over 10,000 supersized photomultiplier tubes to detect the faint pulses of Chernkov radiation emitted on the rare occasion that a neutrino interacts with a water molecule.\n\nThose enormous PM tubes would be the trigger for the sudden demise of the Super-K , which is covered in the second half of the video. During operations to refill the observatory after routine maintenance, technicians noticed a bang followed by a crescendo of noise from the thirteen-story-tall tank. They quickly powered down the system and took a look inside the tank to find almost every PM tube destroyed. The resulting investigation revealed that the tubes had failed in sequence following the sudden implosion of a single tube at the bottom of the tank. That implosion caused a shock wave to propagate through the water to surrounding tubes which exceeded their design limits, causing further implosions and further destruction. The cascading implosion took a full ten seconds to finish its wave of destruction, which destroyed $7 million worth of tubes.\nThe interesting part about this is the root cause analysis, which boils down to the fact that you shouldnt stand on 50-cm photomultiplier tubes. Also at fault was the testing regimen for the tubes, which the project engineers anticipated could cause a cascading implosion. They tested this but were unable to cause a cascade failure, leading them to the conclusion it wasnt likely to happen. But analysis of the destruction revealed a flaw in the testing, which should give pause to anyone who ever had to design a test like this before.\nLuckily, nobody was killed or even hurt during the Super-K incident. The observatory was repaired with upgraded tubes and remains in service to this day, with an even bigger Hyper-Kamiokande detector in the works. Weve covered neutrino observatories before, so check that out if you want more background on the science.\n", "title": "\u8d85\u795e\u5ca1\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30ce\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u5d29\u58ca\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fcKamiokande\u306e\u7834\u640d\u4e8b\u6545\u306f\u3001\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306e\u4e0d\u904b\u306a\u4e00\u65e5\u3092\u63cf\u5199\u3002\u88fd\u9020\u7269\u306e\u5931\u6557\u539f\u56e0\u3068\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3092\u5206\u6790\u3002", "titles": ["\u8d85\u795e\u5ca1\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30ce\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u5d29\u58ca\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u5931\u6557\u306e\u6559\u8a13\uff1a\u8d85\u795e\u5ca1\u306e\u6559\u8a13", "\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30ce\u691c\u51fa\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3068\u8ab2\u984c", "\u7834\u58ca\u306e\u9023\u9396\uff1a\u8d85\u795e\u5ca1\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u60b2\u5287\u7684\u306a\u5d29\u58ca", "\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u8d85\u795e\u5ca1\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30ce\u89b3\u6e2c\u6240\u306b\u5411\u3051\u3066"]}

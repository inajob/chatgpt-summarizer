More is surely better, though, right? With that in mind, [Emily The Engineer] set out to make a third arm for popular YouTuber [This Old Tony], and our primary question is this: is it actually useful?\nThe basic design is based around a strapped-on arm brace, which mounts the additional appendage to the wearers forearm. It uses a motor-driven geared mechanism to open and close a gripper, but the first revision was incredibly slow to open and close, to the point of being almost useless. Changing out the threaded rod that drives the mechanism massively sped up the gripper, much to [Emily]s satisfaction. Strength and mounting upgrades got it to the point where it could actually be used to lift objects like spray cans and bricks. Ultimately, though, the arm mount and controls do kind of prevent the user from using their left hand when they have the third hand fitted.\nIts a fun project, if not exactly a useful one, even if [Emily] does use it to carry extra grocery bags . It does have us wondering if some kind of shoulder or backpack-mounted arms could be useful, though. Its certainly not up to the standards of modern prosthetic, but we do love the idea of human augmentation with additional robot limbs. Heres hoping technology advances further to make builds like this more capable in future!\n\n", "title": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u7b2c3\u306e\u8155\uff1a\u306f\u305f\u3057\u3066\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u3064\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "body": "YouTuber\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b3\u672c\u76ee\u306e\u8155\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5de6\u624b\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u306e\u304c\u96e3\u70b9\u3002\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u80cc\u4e2d\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u8155\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u7b2c3\u306e\u8155\uff1a\u306f\u305f\u3057\u3066\u5f79\u306b\u7acb\u3064\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7b2c3\u306e\u8155\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\uff01\u3000\u8a66\u7528\u7d50\u679c\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u958b\u9589\u3059\u308b\u7b2c3\u306e\u8155\uff1a\u901f\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3084\u30ec\u30f3\u30ac\u3092\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u308b\u7b2c3\u306e\u8155", "\u8ffd\u52a0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u8155\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u5f37\u5316\uff1a\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

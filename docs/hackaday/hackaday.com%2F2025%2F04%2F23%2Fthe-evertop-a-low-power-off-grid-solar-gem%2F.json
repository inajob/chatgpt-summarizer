Enter the Evertop, a portable IBM XT emulator powered by an ESP32 that doesnt just flirt with low power; it basically lives off the grid. Designed by [ericjenott], hacker with a love for old-school computing and survivalist flair, this machine emulates 1980s PCs, runs DOS, Windows 3.0, and even MINIX, and stays powered for hundreds of hours. It has a built-in solar panel and 20,000mAh of battery, basically making it an old-school dream in a new-school shell.\nWhat makes this build truly outstanding  besides the specs  is how it survives with no access to external power. It sports a 5.83-inch e-ink display that consumes zilch when static, hardware switches to cut off unused peripherals (because why waste power on a serial port youre not using?), and a solar panel that pulls 700mA in full sun. And you guessed it  yes, it can hibernate to disk and resume where you left off. The Evertop is a tribute to 1980s computing, and a serious tool to gain some traction at remote hacker camps.\nFor the full breakdown, the original post has everything from firmware details to hibernation circuitry. Whether youre a retro purist or an off-grid prepper, the Evertop deserves a place on your bench.

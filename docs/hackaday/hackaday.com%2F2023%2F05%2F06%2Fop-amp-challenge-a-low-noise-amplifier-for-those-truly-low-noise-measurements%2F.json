The higest quality magnetic tape is low noise compared to its cheaper sibling for example, but still has noise many would consider unacceptable. In instrumentation however, Low Noise has to really mean just that, with a range of specialist techniques to produce circuitry with a truly low noise level for the most demanding of signal applications. As an example [Floydfish] has created a low noise instrumentation amplifier that should serve as a learning exercise for anyone interested in pushing low noise circuitry to the limit.\nAnyone who can dredge the hazy recesses of their mind for barely-remembered electronics lectures will know that the overall noise figure of a system is dictated by that of its first component. Thus perhaps the most interesting part of the schematic is at the input, where a row of low-noise op-amps are presented in parallel. We have to admit having to look this one up, to find that its a technique whereby the signal outputs of each chip are the same and thus sum, while the noise output of each is different and thus the summed noise output is proportionally lower. This stage is then followed by a buffer and a set of filters for different output frequency ranges.\nOur op-amp competition of which this is a part is certainly delivering the goods when it comes to the amny techniques with which these versatile parts can be used. Few of us may need to make such a low noise amplifier, but at least now weve learned how.\n \n\n ", "title": "\u300c\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u6975\u9650\u307e\u3067\u6291\u3048\u305f\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\u300d", "body": "\u300cLow Noise\uff08\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\uff09\u300d\u3068\u306f\u3001\u76f8\u5bfe\u7684\u306a\u8a00\u8449\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306e\u78c1\u6c17\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u3082\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306f\u307e\u3060\u8a31\u5bb9\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u306f\u3001\u6975\u9650\u307e\u3067\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u4e0b\u3052\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u6280\u8853\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002[Floydfish]\u306f\u3001Low Noise instrumentation amplifier\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u5b66\u7fd2\u306e\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3068\u306a\u308b\u3002\u56de\u8def\u306e\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5168\u4f53\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30d5\u30a3\u30ae\u30e5\u30a2\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u5165\u529b\u6642\u306e\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u56de\u8def\u306f\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u51fa\u529b\u306f\u540c\u3058\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u51fa\u529b\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4e26\u5217\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u4e26\u5217\u63a5\u7d9a\u6cd5\u300d\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u7d9a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u304a\u3088\u3073\u51fa\u529b\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u7bc4\u56f2\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u7d9a\u304f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u6975\u9650\u307e\u3067\u6291\u3048\u305f\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u8a08\u6e2c\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u672c\u5f53\u306e\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u56de\u8def\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4e26\u5217\u3067\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u5c02\u9580\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u8d85\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5897\u5e45\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306b\u5fc5\u9808\uff01\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u56de\u8def\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3068\u5fdc\u7528\u300d"]}

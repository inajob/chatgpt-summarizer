For that reason, [Well Done Tips]s idea of 3D printing a gear chain from PLA\u00a0 did not seem like the most promising of hacks to us.\nContrary to expectations, though, it actually worked; at the end of the video (at about 13:25), hes on camera going 20 km/h, which while not speedy, is faster than we thought the fixed gearing would hold up. The gears themselves, as you can see, are simple spurs, and were modeled in Fusion360 using a handy auto-magical gear tool. The idler gears are held in place by a steel bar he welded to the frame, and are rolling on good old-fashioned skateboard bearingstwo each. (Steel ones, not 3D printed bearings.) The healthy width of the spur gears probably goes a long way to explaining how this contraption is able to survive the test ride.\nThe drive gear at the wheel is steel-reinforced by part of the donor bikes cassette, as [Well Done Tips] recognized that the shallow splines on the freewheel hub were not exactly an ideal fit for PLA. He does complain of a squeaking noise during the test ride, and we cant help but wonder if switching to helical gears might help with that. That or perhaps a bit of lubricant, as hes currently riding the gears dry. (Given that he, too, expected them to break the moment his foot hit the pedal, we cant hardly blame him not wanting to bother with grease.)\nWeve seen studies suggesting PLA might not be the best choice of plastic for this application; if this wasnt just a fun hack for a YouTube video, wed expect nylon would be his best bet. Even then, itd still be a hack, not a reliable form of transportation. Good thing this isnt reliable-transportation-a-day!\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30ae\u30a2\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30ae\u30a2\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u4e88\u60f3\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u3084\u7d20\u6750\u9078\u3073\u306b\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30ae\u30a2\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- PLA\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30ae\u30a2\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3068\u6027\u80fd", "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u52d5\u529b\u4f1d\u9054\u7cfb\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- \u92fc\u88fd\u30ae\u30a2\u3068\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3067\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ae\u30a2", "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u6539\u9020\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30ae\u30a2\u306e\u97f3\u554f\u984c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56"]}

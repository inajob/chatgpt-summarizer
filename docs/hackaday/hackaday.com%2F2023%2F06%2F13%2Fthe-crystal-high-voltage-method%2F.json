Honestly, we never thought about it, but [Joe] did and decided to risk his analyzer to find out. He started with some decidedly old-school crystals like you might have found in a 1960-era Novice rig. Since the crystal is piezoelectric, he wondered if using a high DC voltage to bend the crystal to move the frequency to create a variable crystal oscillator (sometimes called a VXO).\nHe created a rig to block DC away from the network analyzer and then feed voltage directly across the crystal. The voltage was from an ESD tester that provides over 1000 volts.\nGetting a crystal to change much in frequency is difficult, which is why they are useful. So we werent surprised that even at very high voltages, the effect wasnt very large. It did change the frequency, but it just wasnt very much.\nAt one point, it looked like he might have killed the test equipment. There was a time when letting the smoke out of a network analyzer would have been a costly mistake, but these days the cost isnt that prohibitive. In the end, this experiment probably doesnt produce any practical results. Still, it is interesting, and we always enjoy watching anything that gives us more intuition about the behavior of circuits or, in this case, circuit elements.\nIf you need a refresher on crystal oscillators, we can help. There are other ways to modify a crystals frequency, of course.\n\n", "title": "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u306f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u5171\u632f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f ", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6c34\u6676\u632f\u52d5\u5b50\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u30011,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u76f4\u6d41\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3001\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8abf\u3079\u305f\u3002\u8abf\u67fb\u3067\u306f\u6c34\u6676\u306e\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306f\u5909\u5316\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5287\u7684\u306a\u5909\u5316\u306f\u898b\u3089\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u306f\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u77e5\u898b\u306f\u751f\u307e\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u56de\u8def\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u306f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u5171\u632f\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f ", "\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u53ef\u5909\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u767a\u632f\u5668\uff08VXO\uff09\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f ", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f ", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u304b\u3051\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u7570\u5e38\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u9a13\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044 ", "\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u767a\u632f\u5668\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u518d\u3073\u5b66\u307c\u3046\u3002\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306f\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u3042\u308b\u3002"]}

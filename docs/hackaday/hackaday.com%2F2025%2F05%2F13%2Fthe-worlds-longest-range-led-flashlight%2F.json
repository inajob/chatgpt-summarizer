While technically handheld, youre gonna need both hands for this monster. According to the creator, it draws 1.2 kW (20 A @ 60 V) to deliver 100,000 lumens and approximately 20,000,000 candelas.\nThis spotlight is made from 48 white LEDs, wired in 16S3P configuration, and is powered by a similarly beefy 20S2P battery pack. That 1.2 kW power draw generates a lot of heat which is dissipated with an array of heat sinks and five cooling fans. Total cost was in the order of $2,000 USD.\nIt can be controlled via Bluetooth, and can run from its batteries for 30 minutes at full power. If youd like to geek out over the specs click-through and read the discussion, a lot of technical detail is given and there are a bunch of photos showing the internals and assembly.\nWeve seen high-output LED lights with water cooling in the past, and wonder if that might be the next step for this particular build.\nThanks to [kms] for the tip.", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2LED\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2\u306eLED\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u3001100,000\u30eb\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u3092\u767a\u5149\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9577\u8ddd\u96e2LED\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "100,000\u30eb\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30ebLED\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8", "20A@60V\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fcLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8", "Bluetooth\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u5de8\u5927LED\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8", "DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a2,000\u30c9\u30eb\u306eLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u5206\u6790"]}

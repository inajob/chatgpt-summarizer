While technically handheld, youre gonna need both hands for this monster. According to the creator, it draws 1.2 kW (20 A @ 60 V) to deliver 100,000 lumens and approximately 20,000,000 candelas.\nThis spotlight is made from 48 white LEDs, wired in 16S3P configuration, and is powered by a similarly beefy 20S2P battery pack. That 1.2 kW power draw generates a lot of heat which is dissipated with an array of heat sinks and five cooling fans. Total cost was in the order of $2,000 USD.\nIt can be controlled via Bluetooth, and can run from its batteries for 30 minutes at full power. If youd like to geek out over the specs click-through and read the discussion, a lot of technical detail is given and there are a bunch of photos showing the internals and assembly.\nWeve seen high-output LED lights with water cooling in the past, and wonder if that might be the next step for this particular build.\nThanks to [kms] for the tip."}

If you have a tendency to forget your reusable bags at home but love to wear hats, [Simone Giertz] has the bag hat for you.\nHaving conquered everything from making the first Tesla pickup to a tambour puzzle table, a hat that can turn into a grocery bag seems like a relatively easy challenge. It was not. One thing that [Giertz] observes early in the process is that fabric is a much less honest material since it can move in ways that many of the other materials she works with cannot, like glass or wood.\nAs with any good project, there are numerous iterations of the bag hat, mostly due to trying to balance the two distinct functions of bag and hat without overly-compromising either. In the end, the hat features a zipper down the center from ear to ear that opens up into a mesh grocery bag. The adjustable loop of the hat does double duty as the bag handle.\nIf youd like to build your own sewing machine for projects like this, maybe you should find out how they work. If youd rather just get on with the sewing bit, we can help you with that too.\n\n"}

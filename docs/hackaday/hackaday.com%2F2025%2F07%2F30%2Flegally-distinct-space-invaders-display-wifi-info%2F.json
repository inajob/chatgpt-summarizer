For this brief time a unique practice arose called wardriving  where people would drive around, document, and use these open wireless networks.\nAlthough the pursuit has diminished with the rise of mobile broadband and WPA encryption, there are still a few use cases for the types of hardware a wardriver would have used. [arduinocelentano] recently built a Wi-Fi strength monitor in this style but with a unique theme.\n\nThe Silly Space Invaders Dashboard (SSID) uses an ESP8266 to periodically scan for WiFi networks and makes a record of all of the ones it discovers. From there it takes a look at the signal strength that it receives and groups them into a few classes. For each class it assigns a Space Invaders-themed sprite corresponding to signal strength, with the strongest ranked at the top for quick and easy viewing. Theres even a special sprite to indicate that most illusive of beasts; the open WiFi network. By the way, if youre wondering why these Invaders dont look like the baddies from your youth, its because the company that owns the rights doesnt like other people playing with their toys.\nDuring the heyday of wardriving we could only have wished for hardware as powerful, capable, small, and power efficient as whats in this project. Most of us that partook in the hobby at its peak generally had bulky laptops, possibly some lead-acid batteries, and perhaps one or more wonky antennas to boot. In a way its almost a shame that this hobby has largely diminished, although there are still a few out there poking around unsecured networks.\n", "title": "- Wi-Fi\u5f37\u5ea6\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u98a8\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e00\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001\u7121\u7dda\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u304c\u6d41\u884c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u3001ESP8266\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fWi-Fi\u4fe1\u53f7\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- Wi-Fi\u5f37\u5ea6\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u98a8\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6700\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- ESP8266\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aWi-Fi\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3Wi-Fi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u63a2\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u9762\u767d\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2", "- \u904e\u53bb\u306e\u8da3\u5473\u300c\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9032\u5316"]}

But the companys history in its various entities stretches back as far as the 1950s in the world of slot machines and eventually electromechanical arcade games. [Arcade Archive] is starting to tell the take of how one of those games is being restored, its a mid-1960s version of Gun Fight, at the Retro Collective museum in Stroud, UK.\nThe game is a table-style end-to-end machine, with the two players facing each other with a pair of diminutive cowboys over a game field composed of Wild West scenery. The whole thing is very dirty indeed, so a substantial part of the video is devoted to their carefully dismantling and cleaning the various parts.\nThis is the first video in what will become a series, but it still gives a significant look into the electromechanical underpinnings of the machine. Its beautifully designed and made, with all parts carefully labelled and laid out with color-coded wiring for easy servicing. For those of us who grew up with electronic versions of Sega Gun Fight, its a fascinating glimpse of a previous generation of gaming, which were looking forward to seeing more of.\nThis is a faithful restoration of an important Sega game, but its not the first time weve featured old Sega arcade hardware.\n\n"}

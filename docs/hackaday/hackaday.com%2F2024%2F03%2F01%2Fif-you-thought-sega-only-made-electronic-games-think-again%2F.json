But the companys history in its various entities stretches back as far as the 1950s in the world of slot machines and eventually electromechanical arcade games. [Arcade Archive] is starting to tell the take of how one of those games is being restored, its a mid-1960s version of Gun Fight, at the Retro Collective museum in Stroud, UK.\nThe game is a table-style end-to-end machine, with the two players facing each other with a pair of diminutive cowboys over a game field composed of Wild West scenery. The whole thing is very dirty indeed, so a substantial part of the video is devoted to their carefully dismantling and cleaning the various parts.\nThis is the first video in what will become a series, but it still gives a significant look into the electromechanical underpinnings of the machine. Its beautifully designed and made, with all parts carefully labelled and laid out with color-coded wiring for easy servicing. For those of us who grew up with electronic versions of Sega Gun Fight, its a fascinating glimpse of a previous generation of gaming, which were looking forward to seeing more of.\nThis is a faithful restoration of an important Sega game, but its not the first time weve featured old Sega arcade hardware.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u300c\u30ac\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u300d", "body": "\u30bb\u30ac\u306f\u30011950\u5e74\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3001\u5f8c\u306b\u96fb\u6c17\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u3057\u30011960\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u76e4\u306e\u30ac\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30022\u4eba\u304c\u9854\u3092\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3001\u4e01\u5be7\u306b\u6383\u9664\u3055\u308c\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u304c\u6620\u50cf\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u300c\u30ac\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u300d", "\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u3089", "\u96fb\u6a5f\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u904a\u622f\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u578b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u5f80\u5e74\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u300c\u30ac\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u5fa9\u5143", "\u30b7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ec\u30b9\u306a\u4fee\u5fa9\uff1a\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u518d\u751f"]}

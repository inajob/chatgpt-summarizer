Theres no getting around it. If, like [Giovanni], you want to keep better track of your usage, you might find value in his DIY energy meter build.\n[Giovanni] built his energy meter to monitor energy usage in his whole home. An ESP32 serves as the heart of this build. Its hooked up with a JSY-MK-194G energy metering module, which uses a current clamp and transformer in order to accurately monitor the amount of energy passing through the mains connection to his home. With this setup, its possible to track voltage, current, frequency, and power factor, so you can really nerd out over the electrical specifics of whats going on. Results are then shared with Home Assistant via the ESPHome plugin and the ESP32s WiFi connection. This allows [Giovanni] to see plots of live and historical data from the power meter via his smartphone.\nA project like this one is a great way to explore saving energy, particularly if you live somewhere without a smart meter or any other sort of accessible usage tracking. Weve featured some of [Giovannis] neat projects before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

Its almost a magical thing, being able to dive into a random box and retrieve just the right part to perform a needful repair or to complete a project without the need to hit the web or hop in the car for a trip to the hardware store. For those who pride themselves on their resourcefulness, it can be a heady experience indeed.\nBut as with everything, such feats of fix-it come at a price. That little squirt of dopamine that comes from having just the right thing can make your monkey brain fixate on a simple equation: More stuff is better stuff. The higher and deeper your stash, the better your chances of having what you need, assuming you can find it, of course. This way lies madness, and perhaps an appearance on a reality TV show.\nIs there a better way? Its hard to say, but we figured it would be a good idea to loop in someone with a lot of experience collecting junk that somehow finds its way into some pretty cool projects. Gabe Emerson runs the popular and aptly named saveitforparts channel over on YouTube, and fancies himself an accomplished hoarder. Wed have to agree, given his recent 1,000-mile drive to pick up a used geodesic dome, or his ever-increasing collection of RV satellite dishes, which he somehow puts to good use. His junk collection is pretty epic; he even has a whole piece of property devoted to the larger pieces of his collection, like an entire monorail train. He seems uniquely qualified to discuss the Hoarders Dilemma and the painful process of deciding what stays and what goes.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, December 6 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.", "title": "12\u67086\u65e5\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u30db\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u30de\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "body": "12\u67086\u65e5\u306e\u5348\u5f8c\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u8981\u54e1\u3068\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\uff1f\n\u81ea\u4f5c\u3084\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3053\u3068\u306f\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5897\u3048\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3068\u7247\u4ed8\u3051\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7269\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308bGabe Emerson\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["12\u67086\u65e5\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u30db\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u30de\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30c0\u30f3\u30af\u30d0\u30f3\u306f\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\uff01\u30db\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u30de\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b", "\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u30b2\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30a8\u30de\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u3068\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3001\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u30de\uff1a\u4f55\u3092\u6368\u3066\u3001\u4f55\u3092\u4fdd\u3064\u3079\u304d\u304b\uff1f"]}

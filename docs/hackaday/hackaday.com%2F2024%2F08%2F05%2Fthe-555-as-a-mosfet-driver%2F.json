A variety of different approaches can be taken, from a bunch of logic buffers in parallel to a specialised MOSFET driver, but [Mr. Ts Design Graveyard] is here with a surprising alternative. As it turns out, the ever-useful 555 timer chip does the job admirably.\nIts a simple enough circuit, the threshold pin is pulled high so the output goes high, and the PWM drive from an Arduino is hooked up to the reset pin. A bipolar 555 can dump a surprising amount of current, so its perfectly happy with a MOSFET. Were warned that the CMOS variants dont have this current feature, and he admits that the 555 takes a bit of current itself, but if you have the need and a 555 is in your parts bin, why not!\nThis will of course come as little surprise to anyone who played with robots back in the day, as a 555 or particularly the 556 dual version made a pretty good and very cheap driver for small motors. If youve ever wondered how these classic hips work, we recently featured an in-depth look.\n\n", "title": "MOSFET\u3092\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u56de\u8def\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "MOSFET\u3092\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306b\u306f\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u5897\u5e45\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u9a5a\u304f\u307b\u3069\u3046\u307e\u304f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u5506\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306f\u3001Arduino\u304b\u3089\u306ePWM\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001MOSFET\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["MOSFET\u3092\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u56de\u8def\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fMOSFET\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u624b\u9806", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u4f8b", "555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5fdc\u7528\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

Unfortunately, though, thats just what happened to the Deep Space Networks 70-meter dish antenna at Goldstone, California. NASA announced the outage this week, but the accident that damaged the dish occurred much earlier, in mid-September. DSS-14, as the antenna is known, is a vital part of the Deep Space Network, which uses huge antennas at three sites (Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra) to stay in touch with satellites and probes from the Moon to the edge of the solar system. The three sites are located roughly 120 degrees apart on the globe, which gives the network full coverage of the sky regardless of the local time.\n\nLosing the Mars Antenna, as DSS-14 is informally known, is a blow to the DSN, a network that was already stretched to the limit of its capabilities, and is likely to be further challenged as the race back to the Moon heats up. As for the cause of the accident, NASA explains that the antenna was over-rotated, causing stress on the cabling and piping in the center of the structure.\u201d Its not clear which axis was over-rotated, but based on some specs we found that say the azimuth travel range is \u00b1265 degrees from wrap center, we suspect it was the vertical axis in the base. It sounds like the azimuth went past that limit, which wrapped the swags of cables and hoses that run the antenna tightly, causing the damage. Wed have thought there would be a physical stop of some sort to prevent over-rotation, but then again, running a structure that big up against a stop would be very much an irresistible force, immovable object scenario. Heres hoping they can get DSS-14 patched up quickly and back in service.\nSpeaking of having a bad day on the job, we have to take pity on these Russian engineers for the demo hell they went through while revealing the countrys first AI-powered humanoid robot. AIdol, as the bot is known, seemed to struggle from the start, doddering from behind some curtains like a nursing home patient with a couple of nervous-looking fellows flanking it. The bot paused briefly before continuing its drunk-walk, pausing again to deliver a somewhat feeble wave to the crowd before entering the terminal stumble and face-plant part of the demo. The bots attendants quickly dragged it away, leaving a pile of parts on the stage while more helpers tried  and failed  to deploy a curtain to hide the scene. It was a pretty sad scene to behold, made worse by the choice of walk-out music (Bill Contis iconic Gonna Fly Now, better known as the theme from Rocky).\n\nWe just noticed that pretty much everything we have to write about this week has a bad day at work vibe to it, so to continue on with that theme, witness this absolutely disgusting restoration of a GPU that spent way too many years in a smokers house. The card, an\u00a0Asus 9800GT Matrix, is from 2008, so it may have spent the last 17 years getting caked with tar and nicotine, along with a fair amount of dust and perhaps cat hair, from the look of it. Having spent way too much time cleaning TVs similarly caked with grossness most foul, we couldnt stomach watching the video of the restoration process, but its available in the article if you dare.\nAnd the final entry in our So you think your job sucks? roundup, behold the poor saps who have to generate training data for AI-powered domestic robots. The story details the travails of Naveen Kumar, who spends his workday on simple chores such as folding towels, with the twist of doing it with a GoPro strapped to his forehead to capture all the action. The videos are then sent to a U.S. client, who uses them to develop a training model so that humanoid robots can eventually copy the surprisingly complex physical movements needed to perform such a mundane task. Training a robot is all well and good, but how about training them how to move around inside a house made for humans? Thats where it gets really creepy, as an AI startup has partnered with a big real estate company to share video footage captured from those walk-through videos real estate agents are so fond of. So if your house has recently been on the market, theres a non-zero chance that its being used to train an army of domestic robots.\nAnd finally, we guess this one fits the rough-day-at-work theme, but only if your job is being a European astronaut, who may someday be chowing down on protein powder made from their own urine. The product is known as Solein  sorry, but have they never seen the movie Soylent Green?  and is made via a gas fermentation process using microbes, electricity, and air. The Earth-based process uses ammonia as a nitrogen source, but in orbit or on long-duration deep-space missions, urea harvested from astronaut pee would be used instead. Theres no word on what Solein tastes like, but from the look of it, and considering the source, wed be a bit reluctant to dig in.", "title": "NASA\u3001\u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u6545\u969c", "body": "NASA\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u6545\u969c\u3002\u6708\u3084\u592a\u967d\u7cfb\u5916\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3002", "titles": ["NASA\u3001\u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u6545\u969c", "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306eAI\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30e2\u3001\u60b2\u60e8\u306a\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u306e\u7159\u3067\u52a3\u5316\u3057\u305fGPU\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "AI\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u7528\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u751f\u6210\u4f5c\u696d\u306e\u82e6\u52b4", "\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u5c3f\u304b\u3089\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30bf\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u8cea\u30d1\u30a6\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u98df\u3079\u308b\u65e5\u304c\u6765\u308b\uff1f"]}

If the problem is supplying enough lithium to build batteries for all the electric vehicles that will be needed by 2030, then a new lithium deposit in Arkansas might be a resounding Yes! The discovery involves the Smackover Formation  and well be honest here that half the reason we chose to feature this story was to be able to write Smackover Formation  which is a limestone aquifer covering a vast arc from the Rio Grande River in Texas through to the western tip of the Florida panhandle. Parts of the aquifer, including the bit that bulges up into southern Arkansas, bear a brine rich in lithium salts, far more so than any of the brines currently commercially exploited for lithium metal production elsewhere in the world. Given the measured concentration and estimated volume of brine in the formation, there could be between 5 million and 19 million tons of lithium in the formation; even at the lower end of the range, thats enough to build nine times the number of EV batteries needed.\n\nThere are still a lot of unknowns, not least of which is whether any of the lithium in the brine is recoverable, and there are surely technical and regulatory hurdles aplenty. But the mere existence of a brine deposit that rich in lithium that covers such a vast area is encouraging; surely theres somewhere within the formation where itll be possible to extract and concentrate the brine in an environmentally sensitive manner. And, once again just for fun, Smackover Formation.\nWhile not ones to cheer for interstellar catastrophes, we cant say that we havent been rooting for Betelgeuse to go supernova these last few years. Ever since the red supergiant star that sits on Orions shoulder started its peculiar dimming a while back, talk among astronomy buffs was that the activity presaged an imminent explosion of the star, one that could make Betelgeuse the brightest object in the night sky for a few months, and possibly make it visible in the daytime as well. As thrilling  and foreboding, at least by ancient astronomy standards  as that sounds, it seems as if the unusual dimming recently observed has a more prosaic explanation: a Betelbuddy star. According to astronomers who pored over observations, after ruling out all the other possibilities to explain the dimming, it seems like there must be a smaller star orbiting Betelgeuse thats periodically plowing a clear spot through the cloud of dust surrounding the dying star. That would explain the periodic dimming and brightening, but why have we not seen this Betelbuddy before? It could be that the smaller star is lost in the giants glare, hiding in its halo of incandescent gas. So, dont hold your breath on seeing a supernova anytime soon.\nDo you find password rules annoying? We sure do, and even using a password manager with a generator that can handle all sorts of restrictions like password length and special characters, being told how to generate a password seems silly, especially since the information on what characters a valid password would have seems like valuable clues to potential crackers. But if for some reason you havent had enough password pestering, try out the password game. You start by entering a password  we, of course, started with correct horse battery staple  and then deal with the consequences of your obviously poor choices. Youll be asked to do all the silly stuff that only decreases the entropy of your password, which only makes it harder to remember and easier to guess. We havent played it through  its way too annoying  but we assume that if you ever actually manage to compose a suitable password, youll be asked to change it every 90 days.\nAnd finally, weve managed to live long enough now to have cycled completely through all the major music recording modalities except wax cylinders. Having heard them all, weve got to agree with the hipsters: vinyl is the best. Thats especially true after watching this fascinating look at the LP record production process, which covers everything from mastering to packaging. The painstaking steps at the beginning are perhaps the most interesting, but anyone who doesnt appreciate the hot vinyl squeezing out from the press is a cold, heartless monster. The video is only 15 minutes long and mercifully free of narration, so enjoy.\n"}

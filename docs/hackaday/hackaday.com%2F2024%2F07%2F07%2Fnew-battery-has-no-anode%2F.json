While this has been done before, according to the University, this is the first time a solid-state sodium battery has successfully used this architecture.\nSodium is abundant compared to lithium, so batteries that use sodium are attractive. According to the University of Chicagos news release:\nAnode-free batteries remove the anode and store the ions on an electrochemical deposition of alkali metal directly on the current collector. This approach enables higher cell voltage, lower cell cost, and increased energy density\n\nOf course, there are also downsides. In particular, making anodeless batteries with liquid electrolytes can be easier to build, but the liquid forms solids that impede the batterys performance over time.\nThe new battery uses an aluminum powder as a current collector. Interestingly, while this is a solid, it flows more like a liquid. Combined with a solid electrolyte, the battery flips the usual idea of a solid cathode and a liquid electrolyte.\nWe are always interested in new battery tech. However, we rarely see them out in the wild. Maybe AI will have better luck."}

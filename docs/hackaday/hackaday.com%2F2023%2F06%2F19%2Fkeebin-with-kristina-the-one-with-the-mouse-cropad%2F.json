What now? Well, most people use some kind of mouse to go along with it, but no one uses a mouse like this creation by [Joe_Scotto].\nThis is the mouse no one asked for, and yet I think its pretty awesome for something thats supposed to be a joke. Maybe its in the great execution, I dont know. I will ignore the suggestion that MX Browns are part of the joke, however. *cries in OG tactility*\nEssentially, this is a macropad that uses QMK mouse keys to emulate a mouse. The build itself couldnt be more straightforward  its six MX browns wired up to six pins on a Pico, and they all share a common ground. Keep the joke going by commissioning one from [Joe] or building it yourself.\nVia [r/cyberdeck]\nNews: Microsoft Discontinues Natural Keyboard\nImage via Wikipedia\nIts often peoples first ergonomic keyboard  some variation of Microsofts Natural keyboard, that 90s split that took up so much real estate on the desk with its built-in wrist rest.\nIll admit that despite using one for years at the office, I went back to whatever clicky rectangles I could get from the IT department. Then came the pain, and I got a Logitech Wave. Then came the surgery, and the Kinesis Advantage.\nWell, now it seems that after 30 years and several ergonomic models, Microsoft are exiting the keyboard game. While I dont personally understand why when there are so many fans, [Jeff Atwood] believes its because keyboards are exploding in popularity and tons of people are building their own. While that may be true, there are legions of normies trying to stave off carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome and have absolutely no interest in building anything, much less a keyboard. So, get these things while theyre hot, I guess.\n\nThe Centerfold: Hobbies, a Family Photo\n\nSometimes one expensive hobby leads to another, and other times they just happily co-exist in peoples lives from some early point. One such Venn diagram centers on mechanical keyboards, headphones, and nice pens, and of course theres a subreddit for that particular trinity. Thats where this is from.\nAlthough there isnt a lot of detail, I can tell you that that is an Alice-like keyboard called the Jabberwocky from [nopunin10did]. And thats an iPod classic 5/5.5 with some kind of mods. And dont those headphones look comfy, whatever they may be?\nLook, its a centerfold. Do you really need a lot of detail, or can you just appreciate it for what it is? I sure would like to know what desk pad that is, though.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Hall Braille Typewriter\nOnce upon a time, Braille typists used a stylus and a writing board to impress dots on paper. The page would then have to be flipped over to read.\nThen, in 1892, Frank H. Hall, superintendent of a school for the blind, invented a Braille typewriter that would change everything. It had six keys that could be pressed in any combination, and the paper was embossed from the back, meaning that the typist could read what theyd written as they went along. Typists could now average 30-60 words per minute, a drastic improvement over the stylus and writing board.\nHalls typewriter buoyed along the six-dot Braille scheme, eventually replacing the eight-dot Kleidograph system. Never intending to profit from the invention, Hall didnt patent it and charged $1 over the manufacturing cost of $10.\nICYMI: Dyeing for the Right Color Keycaps\nIt seems like there are a literal ton of keycap colorways out there, but there will probably never be enough to please everyone. So why not dye your own keycaps? Its really not that difficult, and only takes a minimal setup. Just be sure you have a sacrificial pot to dye them in.\nAll it really requires is Rit dye in whatever colors you need to make up the right shade, some PBT keycaps, and some dish soap. I am very interested to see whether they darken over time from finger oils, so Ill probably have to make some of my own.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

It can be a real pain, especially when the only heat problem a photographer might face back in the day was fogged film from storing a camera in a hot car. Then again, the things a digital camera can do while its not overheated are pretty amazing compared to analog cameras. Win some, lose some, right?\nMaybe not. [Zachary Tong], having recently acquired an Insta360 digital camera, went to extremes to solve its overheating problem with this slick external heat sink project. The camera sports two image sensor assemblies back-to-back with fisheye lenses, allowing it to capture 360\u00b0 images, but at the cost of rapidly overheating. [Zach]s teardown revealed a pretty sophisticated thermal design that at least attempts to deal with the excess heat, including an aluminum heat spreader built into the case, which would be the target of the mod.\nHe attached a custom copper heatsink to a section of the heat spreader, which had been carefully milled flat to provide the best thermal contact. [Zach] used a fancy boron nitride heat transfer paste and attached the heat sink to the spreader with epoxy. A separate aluminum enclosure was bonded to the copper heat sink, giving [Zach] a place to mount his audio sync and timecode recorder and providing extra thermal mass.\nDoes it help? It sure seems to; where [Zach] was previously getting about twenty minutes before thermal shutdown with both cameras running, the heatsink-adorned rig was able to run about six times longer, with the battery giving out first. True, the heatsink takes away from the original sleek lines of the camera and might make it tough to use while snowboarding or surfing, but its still more portable than some external camera heatsinks weve seen. And besides, the copper is pretty gorgeous. \n", "title": "Insta360\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u5916\u90e8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u6700\u8fd1\u3001\u9023\u7d9a\u4f7f\u7528\u5f8c\u6570\u5206\u3067\u904e\u71b1\u3084\u7a81\u7136\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u306b\u60a9\u307e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001[Zachary Tong]\u306fInsta360\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5916\u90e8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7acb\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3067\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u7a3c\u50cd\u6642\u9593\u304c6\u500d\u306b\u5ef6\u3073\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Insta360\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u5916\u90e8\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u306e360\u00b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u51e6\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051", "\u71b1\u3092\u9003\u304c\u3057\u9577\u6642\u9593\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u9632\u6b62\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

This resulted in numbness and paralysis in his right shoulder and arm, with the prognosis being a partial recovery at best. As a writer, this meant facing the most visceral fear possible of writing long-form content no longer being possible. While searching for solutions, [Kurt] looked at various options, including speech-to-text (STT), before focusing on single-handed keyboard options.\nMore after the break\n\nThe reason why STT didnt really work was simple: beyond simple emails and short messages, the voice-driven process just becomes too involved and tedious with editing, rearranging, and deleting of text fragments. [Kurt] couldnt see himself doing a single-pass narration of an article text or dealing with hours of dictating cursor movements.\nOne of the first single-hand typing methods he tried is as simple as its brilliant: by moving the functional hand a few keys over (e.g. left hands index finger on J instead of F), you can access all keys with a single hand. This causes a lot more stress on the good hand, though. Thus, for a long-term solution, something else would be needed.\nThanks to his state loan program (MNStar), [Kurt] was able to try out Maltrons Key Bowl, the TIPY Big Fan, and the Matias Half-QWERTY keyboard, which describes pretty much what they look like. Of these, the Maltron was functional but very clunky, the TIPY required learning a whole new keyboard layout, something which [Kurt] struggled with. Despite its mere 22 keys, the Matias half-QWERTY offered the most straightforward transition from using a full keyboard.\nIt was the Matias keyboard that worked the best for [Kurt], as it allowed him to use both his left hand normally, along with adapting the muscle memory of his right hand to the left one. Although [Kurt] didnt select the Matias in the end, it did inspire him to choose the fourth option: using a custom keymap on his full-sized QWERTY keyboard. In the remaining two parts in this series, Kurt] takes us through the design\u00a0of this keymap along with how others can set it up and use it.\nOur own [Bil Herd] found himself on a similar quest after losing a finger to a ladder accident.\nThanks to [J. Peterson] for the tip.", "title": "\u4e8b\u6545\u304b\u3089\u306e\u56de\u5fa9: \u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u63a2\u7d22", "body": "\u4e8b\u6545\u306b\u3088\u308a\u7247\u624b\u3067\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u56f0\u96e3\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305fKurt\u306f\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8a66\u884c\u3057\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u914d\u7f6e\u3092\u9078\u629e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e8b\u6545\u304b\u3089\u306e\u56de\u5fa9: \u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u63a2\u7d22", "\u97f3\u58f0\u5165\u529b\u306e\u9650\u754c: \u66f8\u304f\u3053\u3068\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u5de6\u624b\u3067\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0: \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u624b\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30b9\u534aQWERTY\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u529b", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u6a21\u7d22"]}

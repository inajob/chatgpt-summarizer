Its become a meme in our community, and its certainly quite funny.\u00a0 But could there be a little truth behind the unintentional joke? [Tedu] presents some possibilities, and theyre not all either far-fetched or without application.\nThe first is called Duelmon, and its a split-screen process and network monitor worthy of two players, while the second is Mirrorkeys, a keyboard splitter which uses the Windows keys as modifiers to supply the missing half. As they say, the ability to use both at once would be the mark of the truly 1337.\nMeanwhile here at Hackaday were evidently closer to 1336.5, as our pieces are written by single writers alone at the keyboard. We would be fascinated to see whether readers could name any other potential weapons in the dual-hacker arsenal though, and wed like to remind you that as always, the comments are open below.\nThe intense hacking scene from NCIS can be found below the break. Be warned though, it contains the trauma of seeing a computer unplugged without shutting down first.\n\n"}

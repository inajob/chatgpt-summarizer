But unless youve really dug into it, you may only know the formula the way a school kid knows how to find the area of a circle. You have to have a bit of higher math to figure out why the equation is what it is. [Old Hack EE] wanted to figure out why the formulas are what they are, so he dug in and shared what he learned in a video you can see below.\nThe key to understanding this is simple. The reactance describes the voltage over the current through the element, just like resistance. The difference is that a resistance is just a single number. A reactance is a curve that gives you a different value at different frequencies. Thats because current and voltage are out of phase through a reactance, so it isnt as easy as just dividing.\nIf you know calculus, the video will make a lot of sense. If you dont know calculus, you might have a few moments of panic, but you can make it. If you think of frequency in Hertz as cycles per second, all the 2\u03c0 you find in these equations convert Hz to radian frequency since one cycle per second is really 360 degrees of the sine wave in one second. There are 2\u03c0 radians in a circle, so it makes sense.\nWe love developing intuition about things that seem fundamental but have a lot of depth to them that we usually ignore. If you need a refresher or a jump start on calculus, it isnt as hard as you probably think. Engineers usually use vectors or imaginary numbers to deal with reactance, and weve talked about that too, if you want to learn more.\n"}

However, [Justinas Petkauskas] still appreciates the iPod for its tactility and portability, and wanted to bring that vibe back. Enter JPL.mp3\nThe build is based around the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. Its hooked up with a PCM5102 DAC hooked up over I2S to provide quality audio, along with a micro SD card interface for music storage, and a small IPS LCD. The best feature, though? The mechanical click-wheel which provides a very tactile way to scroll and interact with the user interface. Everything is assembled into a neat 3D printed case, with a custom four-layer PCB lacing all the electronics together.\nOn the software side, [Justinas] cooked up some custom software for organizing music on the device using a SQLite database. As he primarily listens to classical music, the software features fields for composer/piece and conductor, orchestra, or performer.\n[Justinas] calls the final build chunky, but nevertheless functional and notes it is vaguely reminiscent of classic iPods. We can definitely see the fun in building your own personalized version of a much-enjoyed commercial product, for sure. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own similar hardware, wed certainly love to hear about it.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5cMP3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u300cJPL.mp3\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u3063\u305fMP3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3002\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u611f\u899a\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5cMP3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u300cJPL.mp3\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "ESP32-S3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30bf\u30af\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u97f3\u697d\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

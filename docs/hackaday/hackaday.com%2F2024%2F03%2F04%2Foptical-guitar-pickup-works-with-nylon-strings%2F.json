That doesnt work with nylon strings, because they dont tend to perturb magnetic fields nearly as much, beyond some infinitesimal level that some quantum physicist could explain. So what do you do? You follow [Simon]s example, and build an optical pickup instead.\nThe concept is simple. You place an LED and a phototransistor in a U-shaped channel, and place it so that the string runs through it. You repeat this for each string. Thus, as a string vibrates, it interrupts the light travelling from the LED to the phototransistor. This generates a voltage that varies with the frequency of the strings vibration. Funnily enough, this type of pickup will work just fine on both nylon and steel strings, if you were so inclined to try it.\n[Simon] designed a nifty PCB with six LED-phototransistor pairs (using off-the-shelf interruptor sensors) for use with a nylon-stringed guitar. He reports that sound from the strings comes through clearly, but that there is some noise that is evident in the pickups output, too. Listening to the demo, it seems to capture the sound of the nylon strings well, its just a shame that the noise floor is so high.\nIf you prefer your guitar pickups to be the regular magnetic kind, you can always wind your own from scrap. Demo after the break.\n\nhttps://codeberg.org/Luno/KlimperLux/raw/branch/main/media/demo1.0.flac"}

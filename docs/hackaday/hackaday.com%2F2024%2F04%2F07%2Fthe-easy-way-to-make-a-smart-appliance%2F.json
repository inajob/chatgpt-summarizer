Many of us resolutely refuse to connect these smart appliances to the Internet, but not because we dont see the appeal  we just want to do it on our own terms.\n[Terence Eden] did just this with his rice cooker, using a surprisingly straightforward approach. He simply connected it to the mains via an energy monitoring smart plug, and that was the hardware part, done. Of course, were it that simple we probably wouldnt be featuring this here, as the meat of this project lies in connecting it to his smart home systems and getting something useful from it.\nHes using Home Assistant, and after a bit of messing about had it part of his home automation system. Then it was time for Appliance Status Monitor, which allowed him to easily have the rice cooker send him a notification once it has done its thing by monitoring the power it was using. All online, part of a smart home, and not a byte of his data captured and sold to anyone!\nThis isnt the first home automation project weve brought you from this source."}

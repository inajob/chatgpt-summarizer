He made a short video on the practice, and it\u2019s like a whole new world of sounds exists just outside of our hearing.\nFor instance, a dropped toothpick sounds like you\u2019ve just dropped a piece of lumber, a broken lightbulb sounds like a shattered window, and a blackbird sounds like a blue whale. Besides simply sounding super, [Iftah] speculates that there\u2019s some regularity here: that as you slow down the sound it sounds like it came from sources that are physically bigger. He follows this up in a second video, but if you just think about the basic physics, it makes sense.\nIf you\u2019re interested in recording your own ultrasound, there are a bunch of options on the market. With modern audio processors running up to 192 kHz or even 384 kHz out of the box, all that\u2019s missing is the high-frequency-capable microphone. Those aren\u2019t unobtainable anymore either with many MEMS mics performing well above their rated frequency response specs. Recording ultrasound sounds like a fun and not-too-expensive project to us!\nOf course, most of the ultrasound recording we\u2019ve seen has been about the bats. Check out the Pipistrelle or this pair of DIY bat detectors for some good background. But after watching [Iftah]\u2019s video, we\u2019re no longer convinced that the cute little insectivores are the coolest thing going on in the ultrasound.\n\n", "title": "- \u672a\u77e5\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u97f3\u3067\u63a2\u308b\uff1a\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u9332\u97f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Iftah\u306f\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u3092\u9332\u97f3\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u4f4e\u97f3\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u97f3\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u672a\u77e5\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u97f3\u3067\u63a2\u308b\uff1a\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u9332\u97f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u97f3\u97ff\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u6b6fpick\u306e\u97f3\u304c\u6728\u6750\u306b\uff1f", "- \u9332\u97f3\u30de\u30cb\u30a2\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u9332\u97f3\u306e\u59cb\u3081\u65b9", "- MEMS\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u3067\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c1\uff1aDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "- \u30b3\u30a6\u30e2\u30ea\u9332\u97f3\u304b\u3089\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2\u97f3\u97ff\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u63a2\u6c42\u3078"]}

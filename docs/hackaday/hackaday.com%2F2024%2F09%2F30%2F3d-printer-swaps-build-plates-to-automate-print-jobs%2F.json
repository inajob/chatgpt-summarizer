A stack of fresh build plates is behind the printer, and the printer slips a new one from the bottom when needed. Again, since the printers bed is magnetic, all one has to do is get the new plate to reliably line up and the magnetic attraction does the rest.\nSome methods of automating print jobs rely on ejecting the finished parts\u00a0and others swap the print beds. [Andre]s is the latter type and we do really like how few moving parts are involved, although the resulting system has the drawback of requiring considerably more table space than just the printer itself. Still, its not at all a bad trade-off.\nWatch it in action in the two videos embedded below. The first shows a time-lapse of loading and ejecting over 100 build plates in a row, and the second shows the whole system in action printing bowls in different colors.\n\n", "title": "Bambu A1 Mini\u306e\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b", "body": "Andre Me\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30e7\u30d6\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306fBambu A1 Mini\u3067\u306e\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9774\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u7684\u306b\u3001\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u591a\u304f\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u826f\u3044\u53d6\u5f15\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["Bambu A1 Mini\u306e\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u3067\u4ea4\u63db", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u81ea\u52d5\u4ea4\u63db\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u81ea\u52d5\u5efa\u7bc9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u4ea4\u63db\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

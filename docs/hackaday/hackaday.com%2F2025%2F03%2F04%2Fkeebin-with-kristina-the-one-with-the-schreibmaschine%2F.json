Yeah you do. Well, so does [Sasha K.], who saw the original reddit post and got inspired. [Sasha K.] has more than one IBM Selectric lying around, which is a nice problem to have, and decided to strip one of its keycaps and get to experimenting.\nThe result is a nice adapter that allows them to be used with Kailh chocs  you can find the file on Thingiverse, and check out the video after the break to see how they sound on a set of clicky white chocs.\nThose white chocs are attached to a ThumbsUp! v8 keyboard, a line that [Sasha K.] designed. His daily driver boards are on v9 and v10, but the caps were getting jammed up because of the spacing on those. So instead, he used v8 which has Cherry MX spacing but also supports chocs.\nAs you can see, there is not much to the adapter, which essentially plugs the Selectric keycaps slot and splits the force into the electrical outlet-style pair of holes that chocs bear This feels like an easier problem to solve than making an adapter for MX-style switches. What do you think?\n\n\nDesk-Mounted Macro Pad Does Not Control Desk Height\nImage by [CloffWrangler] via redditBut it sure is a nice-looking first design, isnt it? Especially with that colorway and the ISO Return. Mmm. Reminds me of the Data General Dasher, and for good reason  those are Drops Dasher key caps.\nSo why the number scheme? It means nothing more than that it is representative of the keycaps that [CloffWrangler] had lying around. They are currently used for volume control, toggling mic and webcam in Zoom, and some other stuff that [CloffWrangler] hasnt landed on just yet.\nThis hand-wired, 3D-printed beauty is ruled by a Raspberry Pi Pico and contains Gateron Oil Kings switches. I sure would like to have something similar, but I think I would hit it with my chair quite a bit unless I put it way over there to the right or something. But then I wonder, would it be as useful? If it were at arms length, I might be tempted to rotate the thing 90\u00b0 to the right so it wouldnt be awkward to use.\nThe Centerfold: A Cat Person Lives Here\nImage by [moobel] via redditDont these friendly keycaps look nice and soft? Apparently theyre not, according to [moobel]. Thats unfortunate. But they do feel nice to type on nonetheless.\nSo, thats not too many keys, is it? Thats because this isnt technically a keyboard. Its a pair of Taipo keyboards, which are meant for to be used to chord with either one or both hands. I really appreciate that [moobel] discovered the Taipo and decided to make a pair in order to learn the layout.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: Der Kanzler\nImage by [DonaldDutchie] via redditHow quickly can you type on a typewriter? To a certain extent, it depends on the machine. Der Kanzler Schreibmaschine was a fine piece of German engineering that allowed one to type quickly for an interesting reason: it could print 88 characters using only 11 type bars with 8 characters each.\nHow did that work? Well, each key changed the position of the linkages, moving the slug either up or down. The top row articulates the deepest, while the home row doesnt move at all. Makes sense.\nThe Kanzler was designed by Paul Gruetzmann, and the Kanzler model 1B shown here hit the market in 1903. With the Kanzler line, Gruetzmann was trying to produce a machine that was faster and more stable than others. The company claimed that 200 WPM was technically achievable. Can you imagine typing that fast on your best day, on your favorite keyboard? No chording allowed! :P\nFinally, Some 3D-Printed keycaps for the Kinesis Advantage\nIf youre a Kinesis Advantage owner, one of the first things you notice is that you might not really like the ABS keycaps and will probably want something different. But then you find out that although you can get fun keycap sets in ergo layouts, theyre never gonna be contoured like the factory set, and thats something youll have to get used to that, in my opinion, degrades the Kinesis experience. Right now, it seems like the best option is to just print your own.\nImage by [SimplifyAndAddCoffee] via redditAnd here are the files. If youre wondering about E, that is the original Maltron layout where this whole idea of the concave curvy girl got its start.\nAccording to [SimplifyAndAddCoffee], these lovely keycaps were printed in Siraya Tech Blue Obsidian Black resin on an MSLA printer.\nAfter printing, those inset legends were filled with white epoxy putty. [SimplifyAndAddCoffee] then scraped away the excess and completed the process by wiping them all with an isopropyl alcohol-soaked rag.\nPersonally, I suffer with the original ABS caps on my daily driver Kinesis, but my go-somewhere board has blank PBT caps for ultimate intrigue. Id love to have a set of printed ones, but Id have to have them made somewhere since I dont have any type of resin printer around.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

And indeed, that appears to be exactly what happened to the Rohde  Schwarz 75 dB step attenuator, a part that may have lived in the front end of one of their spectrum analyzers. As one would expect from such an expensive component, the insides have some pretty special engineering. The signal is carried through the five attenuation stages on a narrow strip of copper. Each stage uses a solenoid to move the strip between either a plain conductor or a small Pi pad with a specified attenuation. The attention to detail inside the cavity is amazing, with great care taken to maintain the physical orientation of the stripline to prevent impedance mismatches and unwanted reflections.\nThe Pi pads themselves are fascinating, too, especially under [Shahriar]s super-duper microscope. All of them were destructively removed from the cavity before getting to him, but its still pretty clear whats going on. Thats especially true with the 5-dB pad, which bears clear signs of the overload that brought on the demise of the whole attenuator. We suppose a repair would have been feasible if it had been just the one pad that needed replacement, but with all of them broken, its off to the scrap bin. Or to the recycler  there appears to be plenty of gold in there.\nWe thought this was a fantastic look under the covers of an exquisitely engineered part. Too bad it didnt rate the [Shahriar] X-ray treatment, as this multimeter repair or this 60-GHz phased array did. Oh, well  maybe next time.\n\n"}

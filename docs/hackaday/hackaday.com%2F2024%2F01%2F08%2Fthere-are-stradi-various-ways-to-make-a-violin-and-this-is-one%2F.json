While that dream may never come to pass, it would be far more likely to happen if many of the instruments could be 3D-printed, like this electric violin.\nWe really like this compact design, which mimics a headless guitar with the tuning pegs down by the bridge. [Carmensr] started with a model on Thingiverse, which uses violin strings wound around electric guitar tuners instead of wooden friction pegs. To further the guitar comparison, the three-piece neck contains a truss rod of sorts.\nSo how does it work, though? The magic is in the special bridge, which contains a piezo element. The bridge picks up the strings vibrations and sends them to a little pre-amplifier, which creates a signal that can then be used by a program like Audacity or connected directly to a speaker. Be sure to give it a listen in the video after the break.\nOf course, theres no reason not to design and print acoustic violins. It would be fun to experiment with different filaments for different sounds.\n\n"}

A few days of mingling with the Hackaday community, going through mild panic over badges and SAOs, and enjoying the unique atmosphere of that city.\nAfter discussing the weekends festivities we dive right into the hacks, touching on the coolest of thermal cameras, wildly inefficient but very entertaining wireless power transfer, and a restrospective on the capacitor plague from the early 2000s. Was it industrial espionage gone wrong, or something else? We also take a moment to consider spring PCB cnnectors, as used by both one of the Hackaday Europe SAOs, and a rather neat PCB resistance decade box, before looking at a tryly astounding PCB blinky that sets a new miniaturisation standard.\nIn our quick roundup the standouts are a 1970s British kit synthesiser and an emulated 6502 system written in shell script, and in the cant-miss section we look at a new contender fro the smallest microcontroller, and the posibility that a century of waste coal ash may conceal a fortune in rare earth elements.\nFollow the link below, to listen along!\n\nWant the podcast in MP3?\u00a0 Get it in MP3!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 312 Show Notes:\nWhats that Sound?\n\nIf you know what that sound was, and we think you probably do, put your name down here to be in the drawing for the t-shirt.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nThe Capacitor Plague Of The Early 2000s\nMake Your Cheap Thermal Camera Into A Microscope\nTransmitting Wireless Power Over Longer Distances\nA Decade Resistance Box From PCBs\nWorld\u2019s Smallest Blinky, Now Even Smaller\nWriting A GPS Receiver From Scratch\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nReviving A Maplin 4600 DIY Synthesizer From The 1970s\nMake Fancy Resin Printer 3D Models FDM-Friendly\nChemistry Meets Mechatronics In This Engaging Art Piece\nCurrent Mirrors Tame Common Mode Noise\nSpeeding Up Your Projects With Direct Memory Access\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\nPick Up A Pebble Again\nTurning Down The Noise On SMPS\nA 6502, In The Shell\nRepairing A Kodak Picture Maker Kiosk\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\n\n\nAsk Hackaday: What Would You Do With The World\u2019s Smallest Microcontroller?\nFrom The Ashes: Coal Ash May Offer Rich Source Of Rare Earth Elements\n\n\n"}

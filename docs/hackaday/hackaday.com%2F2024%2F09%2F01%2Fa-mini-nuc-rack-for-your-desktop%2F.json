And if that thing actually does what its supposed to? Squee! So naturally, we rushed to bring you news of this mini NUC rack designed by [Jeremy Weatherford].\nInspiration comes from a lot of places, often times from stuff that lives on your desk. [Jeremy] had a pile of NUCs and thought they resembled a mini rack already, so why not build them one to live in? It was the perfect excuse to learn CAD, so off [Jeremy] went. Although this is a mini rack, the parts were too big to print. Another opportunity presented itself, and [Jeremy] tried out an online service to get the acrylic cut.\nAssembly may have been fiddly with super glue all over the nice black acrylic, but [Jeremy] learned an important tip: excess glue can be removed with vegetable oil. Once it was built, he decided to make it into a control system lab and even found a perfect little five-port switch to top it off. The logo plate, of course, is the icing on this cake.\nIf you prefer your tower of mini-computers to be extruded, we covered a clever design from [Jay Doscher] back in May.", "title": "Jeremy Weatherford\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30df\u30cbNUC\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u5c0f\u3055\u306aNUC\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002CAD\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u826f\u3044\u6a5f\u4f1a\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u3092\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u306b\u306f\u591a\u5c11\u624b\u9593\u53d6\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u91ce\u83dc\u6cb9\u3067\u4f59\u5206\u306a\u63a5\u7740\u5264\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u9664\u304f\u30b3\u30c4\u3092\u5b66\u3093\u3060\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Jeremy Weatherford\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30df\u30cbNUC\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30e9\u30c3\u30af", "CAD\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3092\u8a66\u3059", "\u30df\u30cb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u5ba4\u306b"]}

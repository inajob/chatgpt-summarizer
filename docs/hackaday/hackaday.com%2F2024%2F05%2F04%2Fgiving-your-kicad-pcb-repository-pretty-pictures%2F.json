On their own, however, your board files might have the repo look a bit barren; having a picture or two in the README is the best. Making them yourself takes time  what if you could have it happen automatically? Enter [kicad-render], a GitHubGitLab integration for rendering your KiCad projects by [linalinn].\nThis integration makes your board pictures, top and bottom view, generated on every push into the repo  just embed two image links into your README.md. This integration is made possible thanks to the new option in KiCad 8s kicad-cli  board image generation, and [linalinn]s code makes KiCad run on GitHub/GitLab servers.\nFor even more bling, you can enable an option to generate a GIF that rotates your board, in the style of that one [arturo182] demo  in fact, this integrations GIF code was borrowed from that script! Got a repository with many boards in one? Theres an option you could make work for yourself, too.\nAll you need to do is to follow a couple of simple steps; [linalinn] has documented both the GitHub and GitLab integration. Weve recently talked about KiCad integrations in more detail, if youre wondering what else your repository could be doing!"}

But in most cases, that\u2019s simply not true. Space is rather dark, so to make out dim objects, you\u2019ll need to amplify the available light. This can be done with a larger telescope, but that\u2019s an expensive route. Alternatively, you can observe objects for longer periods. This second approach is what [BLANCHARD Jordan] chose, creating a budget electronic eyepiece for his telescope.\nThis eyepiece is housed in a 3D printed enclosure designed to fit a standard 1.25 telescope focuser. The sleek, ergonomic enclosure resembles a night vision device, with a 0.39 screen for real-time observation of what the camera captures through the telescope. The screen isn\u2019t the only way to view  a USB-C video capture module lets you connect a phone or computer to save images as if you were peering through the viewfinder.\nThe star of this project is the IMX307 camera module, which supports sense-up mode for 1.2-second exposures and increased gain to capture dim objects without post-processing. This sensor, commonly used in low-light security cameras and dash cams, excels at revealing faint celestial details. All combined, this project cost under 200 Euros, an absolute steal in the often pricey world of astronomy.\nDont have a telescope? Dont worry, you can build one of those as well.", "title": "- \u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u4ed8\u304d\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\u6c0f\u306f\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u30a2\u30a4\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001\u6697\u3044\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3002IMX307\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001200\u30e6\u30fc\u30ed\u672a\u6e80\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u4ed8\u304d\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30eb\u30b4\u30ce\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u7528\u30a2\u30a4\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9", "- IMX307\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6697\u3044\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c\u8853", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3084PC\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUSB-C\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u30c6\u30ec\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306a\u3057\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

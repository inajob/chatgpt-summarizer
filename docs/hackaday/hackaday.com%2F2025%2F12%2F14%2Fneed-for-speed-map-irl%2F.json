This idea goes back well before the first in-vehicle GPS systems, and although these real-world mini maps are commonplace now, they dont have the same feel as the mini maps from retro video games. [Garage Tinkering] set out to solve this problem, and do it on minimal hardware.\nBefore getting to the hardware, though, the map itself needed to be created. [Garage Tinkering] is modeling his mini map on\u00a0Need For Speed: Underground 2, including layers and waypoints. Through a combination of various open information sources he was able to put together an entire map of the UK and code it for main roads, side roads, waterways, and woodlands, as well as adding in waypoints like car parks, gas/petrol stations, and train stations, and coding their colors and gradients to match that of his favorite retro racing game.\nTo get this huge and detailed map onto small hardware isnt an easy task, though. Hes using an ESP32 with a built-in circular screen, which means it cant store the whole map at once. Instead, the map is split into a grid, each associated with a latitude and longitude, and only the grids that are needed are loaded at any one time. The major concession made for the sake of the hardware was to forgo rotating the grid squares to keep the car icon pointed up. Rotating the grids took too much processing power and made the map updates jittery, so instead, the map stays pointed north, and the car icon rotates. This isnt completely faithful to the game, but it looks much better on this hardware.\nThe last step was to actually wire it all up, get real GPS data from a receiver, and fit it into the car for real-world use. [Garage Tinkering] has a 350Z that this is going into, which is also period-correct to recreate the aesthetics of this video game. Everything works as expected and loads smoothly, which probably shouldnt be a surprise given how much time he spent working on the programming. If youd rather take real-world data into a video game instead of video game data into the real world, we have also seen builds that do things like take Open Street Map data into Minecraft.\nThanks to [Keith] for the tip!\n\n"}

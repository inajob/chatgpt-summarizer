Its likely that few people dont own something made in that city or with parts that have passed through companies in the legendary electronic component markets of its Huaqiangbei district.\nFor years now the essential introduction to this world has come in the form of [Bunnie Huang]s Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen, a publication that unlocks the Chinese-speaking maze of vendors. All paper publications eventually become dated though, and this guide is no exception, so were very pleased to see a new version is on its way. Better still, it comes courtesy of Shenzhen native and maker extraordinaire [Naomi Wu], whose video series on YouTube has opened up so many corners of her city for those of us thousands of miles away. We cant wait to see what she puts in it.\nIts also very good indeed on another level to see [Naomi]s involvement, as earlier in the year she had to curtail her social media output under pressure from the Chinese government. We miss her unique window into the wonders of her city, and aside from her online shop its been concerning to hear very little from her of late. You can hear her talking about the book in a promotional video below the break.\n\n"}

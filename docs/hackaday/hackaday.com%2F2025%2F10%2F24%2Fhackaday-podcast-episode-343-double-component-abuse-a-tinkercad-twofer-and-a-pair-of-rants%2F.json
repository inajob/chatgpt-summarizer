We watch as a POV globe takes to the skies, once it has enough motors.\nThen we discuss several awesome hacks such as an incredible desk that simulates beehive activity, a really great handheld PC build, and a Tinkercad twofer. Finally, we discuss the future of removable batteries, and the history of movable type.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 343 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nAnnouncing The 2025 Hackaday Superconference Communicator Badge\nComponent Abuse Challenge\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nWho can say?

He has managed to pull off the ultimate mind-bender: running Linux inside a PDF file. Yep, you read that right. A full Linux distro chugging along in a virtual machine all encapsulated within a document. Just when you thought running DOOM was the epitome of it. You can even try it out in your own browser, right here. Mind-boggling, or downright Pandoras box?\nLets unpack how this black magic works. The humble PDF file format supports JavaScript  with a limited standard library, mind you. By leveraging this, [vk6] managed to compile a RISC-V emulator (TinyEMU) into JavaScript using an old version of Emscripten targeting asm.js instead of WebAssembly. The emulator, embedded within the PDF, interfaces with virtual input through a keyboard and text box.\nThe graphical output is ingeniously rendered as ASCII characters  each line displayed in a separate text field. It\u2019s a wild solution but works astonishingly well for something so unconventional.\nSecurity-wise, this definitely raises eyebrows. PDFs have long been vectors for malware, but this pushes things further: PDFs with computational power. We know not to trust Word documents, whether they just capable of running Doom, or trash your entire system in a blink. This PDF anomaly unfolds a complete, powerful operating system in front of your very eyes. Should we think lightly, and hope itll lead to smarter, more interactive PDFs  or will it bring us innocent looking files weaponized for chaos?\nCurious minds, go take a look for yourself. The project\u2019s code is available on GitHub.\n\n"}

In this case, we follow the journey of [Marc Corfmat]s Polaroid OneStep Camera from his initial attempts at LEGO stardom with his brother [Nick] to the current set that took off.\nWhile the initial idea and build are the seed for a new set, once the project is in the hands of LEGO, designers meticulously make revision after revision to ensure the set is enjoyable to build and any moving parts continue to function for thousands of cycles. This is all weighed against the total cost of the BOM as well as any licensing required for intellectual property. One particularly interesting part of the article is how designers at LEGO are afforded a certain number of frames for custom bricks which leads to some interesting hacks and collaboration as all good constraints do.\nFor more LEGO hacks, checkout LEGOs long lost cousin, testing LEGO-compatible axle materials, or these giant LEGO-like pieces."}

While we suppose it is technically unnecessary, we love the look of it, and we hope he just used it to get the quirky acronym.\nWhen we build custom CPUs they look suspiciously like FPGA development boards, but not BURP. We immediately thought of the IMSAI and the H8 when we saw it, but [Bob] points out it also borrows from the PDP-11.\n\nOn the other hand, none of those computers had gorgeous dot matrix LED disassemblers on the front panel. The computer uses its own language, CHASM, which is a bit like assembly language and a bit like C.\nThe case is a tank. At first, [Bob] didnt use all TTL chips but didnt want to go as far as FPGAs, so he settled for CPLDs, which were smaller forerunners to modern FPGAs. However, his microcode ROM is a well umm 32-bit microcontroller. But he swears to us it is used only as a ROM that he can program without hassle. This wasnt entirely successful, so he finally bit the bullet and switched to an FPGA. There are still some CPU-emulated ROMs in the new system. There are also CPUs dealing with the front panel (especially the disassembler) and managing USB and mass storage.\nUnlike some homebrew computers, BURP can address 64K of memory, has 16 registers, and clocks at a respectable 2.1 million instructions per second. There are 99 instructions in 27 broad categories.\nWhile we know it was unnecessary, we liked it. There arent plans for the build that hwe could find, but there were a lot of ideas wed like to borrow next time were building a toy CPU. Weve seen builds that were a Z-80 (or other CPU) with a microcontroller for all the other parts. Or, just emulate everything. We dont judge. Building your own CPU is a feat if you use relays, tubes, transistors, ICs, or even software.\n"}

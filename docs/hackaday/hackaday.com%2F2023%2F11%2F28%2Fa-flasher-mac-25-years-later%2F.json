In many cases this was on a SIMM-like daughter board, and it would have been a true ROM that was unable to be reprogrammed. This is not the end of the story though, and [Doug Brown] set out on the trail of a Flash-based ROM module allowing the firmware on these machines to be updated.\nThe trail was warm thanks to an Apple developer utility found on a secondhand Mac prototype, allowing ROM flashing. A little disassembly allowed a list of valid IDs to be made, and this info coupled with a bit of reverse engineering from online photos of a real Apple Flash ROM from the 90s allowed a new board to be created with four Am28F020\u00a0 chips. He can now flash at will, with such oddities as running ROMs from different machines with the wrong startup chime. Its an interesting little piece of 1990s Mac trivia, settled.\nThis isnt the first time weve peered at Apple ROMs, indeed some of the older ones had plenty of Easter eggs hidden within."}

Frustration with this is what led [Simon Willison] to make The Incomplete JSON pretty printer, a single-purpose web tool that pretty-prints JSON regardless of whether its complete or not.\nMaking a tool to solve a particular issue is a fantastic application of software, but in this case it also is a good lead-in to some thoughts [Simon] has to share about vibe coding. The incomplete JSON printer is a perfect example of vibe coding, being the product of [Simon] directing an LLM to iteratively create a tool and not looking at the actual code once.\nSometimes, however the machine decides to code something is fine.\n[Simon] shares that the term vibe coding was first used in a social media post by [Andrej Karpathy], who weve seen shared a hello world of GPT-based LLMs\u00a0as well as how to train one in pure C, both of which are the product of a deep understanding of the subject (and fantastically educational) so he certainly knows how things work.\nAnyway, [Andrej] had a very specific idea he was describing with vibe coding: that of engaging with the tool in almost a state of flow for something like a weekend project, just focused on iterating ones way to what they want without fussing the details. Why? Because doing so is new, engaging, and fun.\nSince then, vibe coding as a term seems to get used to refer to any and all AI-assisted coding, a subject on which folks have quite a few thoughts (many of which were eagerly shared on a recent Ask Hackaday on the subject).\nOf course human oversight is critical to a solid and reliable development workflow. But not all software is the same. In the case of the Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer, [Simon] really doesnt care what the code actually looks like. He got it made in a short amount of time, the tool does exactly what he wants, and its hard to imagine the stakes being any lower. To [Simon], however the LMM decided to do things is fine, and theres a place for that.", "title": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306aJSON\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306aJSON\u3092\u6574\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30e2\u30f3\u3002\u6d41\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u300c\u30d0\u30a4\u30d6\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8003\u3048\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u306aJSON\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u300c\u30d0\u30a4\u30d6\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "Simon Willison\u304c\u8a9e\u308bAI\u652f\u63f4\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u672a\u6765", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6d41\u308c\uff1a\u6d41\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13", "\u786c\u76f4\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\uff01\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

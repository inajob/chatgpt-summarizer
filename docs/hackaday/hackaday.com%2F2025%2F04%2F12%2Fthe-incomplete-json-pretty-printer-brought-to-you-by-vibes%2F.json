Frustration with this is what led [Simon Willison] to make The Incomplete JSON pretty printer, a single-purpose web tool that pretty-prints JSON regardless of whether its complete or not.\nMaking a tool to solve a particular issue is a fantastic application of software, but in this case it also is a good lead-in to some thoughts [Simon] has to share about vibe coding. The incomplete JSON printer is a perfect example of vibe coding, being the product of [Simon] directing an LLM to iteratively create a tool and not looking at the actual code once.\nSometimes, however the machine decides to code something is fine.\n[Simon] shares that the term vibe coding was first used in a social media post by [Andrej Karpathy], who weve seen shared a hello world of GPT-based LLMs\u00a0as well as how to train one in pure C, both of which are the product of a deep understanding of the subject (and fantastically educational) so he certainly knows how things work.\nAnyway, [Andrej] had a very specific idea he was describing with vibe coding: that of engaging with the tool in almost a state of flow for something like a weekend project, just focused on iterating ones way to what they want without fussing the details. Why? Because doing so is new, engaging, and fun.\nSince then, vibe coding as a term seems to get used to refer to any and all AI-assisted coding, a subject on which folks have quite a few thoughts (many of which were eagerly shared on a recent Ask Hackaday on the subject).\nOf course human oversight is critical to a solid and reliable development workflow. But not all software is the same. In the case of the Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer, [Simon] really doesnt care what the code actually looks like. He got it made in a short amount of time, the tool does exactly what he wants, and its hard to imagine the stakes being any lower. To [Simon], however the LMM decided to do things is fine, and theres a place for that."}

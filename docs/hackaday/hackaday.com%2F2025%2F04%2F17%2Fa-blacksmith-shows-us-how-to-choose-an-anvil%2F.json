For anyone not knowing where to turn theres a video from [Black Bear Forge], in which he takes us through a range of budget options.\nHe starts with a sledgehammer, the simplest anvil of all, which we would agree makes a very accessible means to do simple forge work. He shows us a rail anvil and a couple of broken old anvils, before spending some time on a cheap Vevor anvil and going on to some much nicer more professional ones. Its probably the Vevor which is the most interesting of the ones on show though, not because it is particularly good but because its a chance to see up close one of these very cheap anvils.\nAre they worth taking the chance? The one hes got has plenty of rough parts and casting flaws, an oddly-sited pritchel and a hardy hole thats too small. These anvils are sometimes referred to as Anvil shaped objects, and while this one could make a reasonable starter its not difficult to see why it might not be the best purchase. Its a subject we have touched on before in our blacksmithing series, so were particularly interested to see his take on it.\n\n", "title": "- \u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u935b\u51b6\u7089\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "body": "\u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u935b\u51b6\u7528\u91d1\u5e8a\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6b20\u70b9\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e88\u7b97\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305f\u935b\u51b6\u7089\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "- \u7c21\u6613\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb: \u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u935b\u51b6\u5165\u9580", "- Vevor\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc: \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u5f62\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "- \u935b\u51b6\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d3\u30eb\u9078\u3073\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8"]}

In his talk, well hear about a vision of the future where consumer electronics can be tossed in the garden and turned into compost instead of sitting in a landfill for the next 1,000 years or so.\nYoull also hear about a particularly clever manipulation of Apples AirTag infrastructure, how a classic kids toy was turned into a unique display with the help of computer vision, and the workarounds required to keep older Global Positioning System (GPS) hardware up and running. Theyll also cover DIY toasters, extracting your data from a smart ring before the manufacturer can sell it, a LEGO interferometer, and a new feature added to the Bus Pirate 5s already impressive list of capabilities.\nCapping off the episode theres a discussion about the surprising (or depending on how you think about it, unsurprising) amount of hardware that was on display at FOSDEM this year, and the history of one of mans most infernal creations, the shopping cart wheel lock.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and listen from the comfort of your shopping cart.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 311 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Europe 2025 Welcomes David Cuartielles, Announces Friday Night Bring-a-Hack\nSkype Is Shutting Down On May 5th\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nKnow that sound?

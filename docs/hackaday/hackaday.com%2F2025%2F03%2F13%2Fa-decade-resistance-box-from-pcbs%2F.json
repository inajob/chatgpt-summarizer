They used to be quite expensive in line with the cost of close-tolerance resistors, but the prices have come down and its within reach to build your own. Electronic design consultancy Dekimo have a nice design for one made from a series of PCBs which they normally give out at trade fairs, but now theyve released the files for download.\nIts released as Gerbers and BOM with a pick-and-place file only, and theres no licence so its free-as-in-beer, but that should be enough if you fancy a go. Our Gerber viewer is playing up so were not entirely sure how reliable using PCBs as wafer switches will be long-term, but since the pictures are all ENIG boards wed guess the gold plating will be much better than the HASL on all those cheap multimeters.\nWe like this as a conference giveaway, being used to badges its refreshing to see a passive take on a PCB artwork. Meanwhile this isnt the first resistance box weve seen with unconventional switches.", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30c7\u30ab\u30c7 resistance box \u304c\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u30c7\u30ab\u30c9\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "- \u7121\u6599\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\uff01\u30c7\u30ab\u30c9\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb", "- PCB\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30ab\u30c9\u62b5\u6297\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

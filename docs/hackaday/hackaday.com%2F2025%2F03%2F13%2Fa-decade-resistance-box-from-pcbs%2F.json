They used to be quite expensive in line with the cost of close-tolerance resistors, but the prices have come down and its within reach to build your own. Electronic design consultancy Dekimo have a nice design for one made from a series of PCBs which they normally give out at trade fairs, but now theyve released the files for download.\nIts released as Gerbers and BOM with a pick-and-place file only, and theres no licence so its free-as-in-beer, but that should be enough if you fancy a go. Our Gerber viewer is playing up so were not entirely sure how reliable using PCBs as wafer switches will be long-term, but since the pictures are all ENIG boards wed guess the gold plating will be much better than the HASL on all those cheap multimeters.\nWe like this as a conference giveaway, being used to badges its refreshing to see a passive take on a PCB artwork. Meanwhile this isnt the first resistance box weve seen with unconventional switches."}

Initially the goal was to get the GameCube keyboard controller integrated with the game Animal Crossing. The GameCube keyboard controller is a genuine part manufactured and sold by Nintendo but the game Animal Crossing isnt compatible with this controller. Rather, Animal Crossing has an on-screen keyboard which players can use with a standard controller. [Hunter] found this frustrating to use so he created an adapter which would intercept the keyboard controller protocol and replace it with equivalent keypresses from an emulated standard controller.\n\nIn this project [Hunter] intercepts the controller protocol and the keyboard protocol with a Raspberry Pi Pico and then forwards them along to an attached GameCube by emulating a standard controller from the Pico. Having got that to work [Hunter] then went on to add a bunch of extra features.\nFirst he designed and 3D-printed a new set of keycaps to match the symbols available in the in-game character set and added support for those. Then he made a keyboard mode for entering musical tunes in the game. Then he integrated a database of cheat codes to unlock most special items available in the game. Then he made it possible to import images (in low-resolution, 3232 pixels) into the game. Then he made it possible to play (low-resolution) videos in the game. And finally he implemented a game of Snake, in-game! Very cool.\nIf you already own a GameCube and keyboard controller (or if you wanted to get them) this project would be good fun and doesnt demand too much extra hardware. Just a Raspberry Pi Pico, two GameCube controller cables, two resistors, and a Schottky diode. And if youre interested in Animal Crossing you might enjoy getting it to boot Linux!\nThanks very much to [Hunter] for writing in to let us know about this project. Have your own project? Let us know on the tipsline!\n", "title": "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u7528\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u300e\u3042\u3064\u307e\u308c \u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee\u300f\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306fGameCube\u7528\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3067Animal Crossing\u3068\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u7528\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u300e\u3042\u3064\u307e\u308c \u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee\u300f\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u3084\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7279\u5225\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u300e\u3042\u3064\u307e\u308c \u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee\u300f\u3067\u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

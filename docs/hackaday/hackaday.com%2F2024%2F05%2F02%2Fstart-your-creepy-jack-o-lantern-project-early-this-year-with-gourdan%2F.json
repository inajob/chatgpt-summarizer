Thus, if youre starting your Halloween builds\u00a0after the holiday displays have already hit the stores, youre probably too late. Were here to implore you to start building early this year\u2014and you can take inspiration from a great pumpkin called Gourdan.\nGourdan is the work of [Braden Sunwold]. Its a pumpkin with a fearsome visage and creepy eyes that follow you around the room. This is achieved thanks to a Raspberry Pi 3 nestled within Gourdans gourdy body. Gourdans eyes are a pair of 1.54-inch LCDs which display animated eyes. Thus, no mechanical wizardry is required here\u2014its all done digitally. A camera attached to the Raspberry Pi tracks people with the aid of OpenCV, and the eyes are created and animated with the help of Adafruit example code.\nTheres never a better time to start hacking for Halloween than right now. And hey, who knows\u2014your neighbour might have kicked off in January, so theyll have an almighty head start. They could have something really impressive in the works!\nAnd dont forget\u2014you can always send us your holiday hacks, whatever the time of year! Just hit up the tipsline. Happy making!"}

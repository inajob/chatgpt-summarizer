It was soon eclipsed by Netscape Navigator, and later Internet Explorer, which became the titans of the 1990s browser market. In turn, they too would falter. Navigators dying corpse ended up feeding what would become Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer later morphed into the unexceptional browser known as Edge.\nFew of us have had any reason to think about Netscape Navigator since its demise in 2008. And yet, the name lingers on. A zombie from a forgotten age, risen again to haunt us today.\n\nThe Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall\nNetscape Navigator was once\u00a0the browser to use, dominating its rivals with a 90% market share. Unfortunately, that reign of glory only lasted until the last few years of the 1990s, when Internet Explorer began to embrace, extend, and extinguish. Explorer was included with every copy of Windows sold, it was distributed by AOL and minor ISPs alike, and it was better at keeping up with, or outright creating, new standards at a time when Netscapes developers became stuck in the quagmire of an an increasingly aging codebase.\nNetscape was great right through the 4.0s, but Netscape 5 was cancelled, and Netscape 6 was a mess. The company was bought out by AOL, and the product limped on into the early 2000s, but it was eventually declared dead on March 1, 2008. With almost no user base to speak of at that point, it simply did not make sense to continue.\nYou might think, then, that the Netscape name died with the browser and that it would never be seen or heard again. Unfortunately, thats almost never the case when it comes to recognizable names in the tech world. Somebody always seems to hang on to the rights to do something with them, even if its usually unsuccessful. Sometimes it goes well, but more often than not, it amounts to little more than a hackneyed old logo slapped on a product that nobody really cares about.\nConnect to the Internet by dialing up the Netscape ISP! Ironically founded several years after the browser ceased to be relevant at all.

It would go on to use the name to start a dial-up ISP in 2004, called Netscape Internet Service. Its unclear precisely why this was done, given that AOL already\u00a0was an ISP in its own right, which ran dial-up service all the way up until September 2025.\nBut for whatever reason, Netscape ISP kicked off operations on January 8, 2004, initially offering unlimited use for just $9.95 a month. Notably, it seems the name was the point\u2014with the barebones site noting that you were getting a reliable Internet connection from a name you trust. It was also somewhat different from the contemporary AOL offering, in that you didnt need a CD full of bloatware to access the service.\u00a0 The signup site went so far as to explain that you didnt need to use a Netscape Navigator browser to access the service; any would do. As a cool bonus, you got a sweet @netscape.com email address when you signed up.\nEven in 2016, the Netscape ISP was still offering dial-up connections only. However, you could get additional netscape.com email addresses for an extra $2.00 a month, along with various other add-ons of questionable value.

It also later added Web Accelerator, which was a simple compression tool that promised to let you surf the web up to 5x faster. In reality, it was marketing fluff that did not make a lot of difference to dial-up users chugging along on slow connections. Weirdly, the Netscape ISP never transitioned over to selling DSL or fiber or any sort of modern broadband connection. As recently as 2018, you could still sign up for a service that was entirely dial-up only. Eventually, at some point in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Netscape ISP appeared to stop accepting new signups, with the main webpage (isp.netscape.com) eventually turning into a generic news aggregator. It remains in that state today at the time of writing.\nPerhaps the most hilarious part of the Netscape ISP story, though, is that it eventually spawned its own browser. Somewhere deep in the bowels of an AOL office, some poor developer had to hack together a Chromium fork to slap the Netscape ISP branding on it. You can still download it today, thanks to a link lurking on the bottom of the Netscape ISP site. We gave it a look.\nThe Netscape ISP page as it stands in 2026. This format has been used on the site since at least 2022; it appears the ISP stopped accepting new customers some years prior.

The browser is very obviously a reskinned version of Chromium from mid-2024, with a bit of AOL search bloatware thrown in for good measure.\nWhile you can\u00a0still download the silly 2024 Netscape browser, you cant use the ISP anymore. Thats because AOL killed it dead in November 2025. Affected users will be able to maintain their super-cool netscape.com email addresses, but no more will you be able to dial up to access the Internet with your Netscape ISP account. To ease the change, AOL offered to transition affected users over to the Complete by AOL service, while also recommending alternatives like Starlink, HughesNet, Dialup4Less.com, and T-Mobile and Verizon 5G home internet plans. Yes, even in late 2025, your dying dial-up ISP was willing to recommend another that still operates on the old-fashioned phone lines, just as our ancestors intended.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing wed love to see are the user statistics for the Netscape ISP over the past two decades. Its hard to imagine there were a whole lot of people that were inconvenienced when AOLs random off-shoot dial-up ISP went down in November 2025. It has to be some tiny figure, even less than the number of dial-up users that were still on the companys main service, which shut down a month earlier. Still, they felt the need to issue a notice to users, so somebody must still have been calling in now and then, using their glacial 56K connection to check the weather and catch up on the latest updates in the Ivy League squash standings.\nIn any case, save for a tired old website and a rapidly-aging port of Chrome, Netscape is finally\u00a0dead. For good this time. Until the logo turns up on a bunch of smart TVs and a badly-rebadged smartphone, or something. Until then, the big N shall hopefully be laid to rest.", "title": "- \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u738b\u8005\u304b\u3089\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u7406\u7531", "body": "Netscape Navigator\u306f1993\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u4e00\u6642\u306f90%\u306e\u5e02\u5834\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u8a87\u3063\u305f\u304c\u30012008\u5e74\u306b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u7d42\u4e86\u3002AOL\u304c\u305d\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u6a29\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u5f8c\u3001\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7ISP\u3068\u3057\u3066\u518d\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30012025\u5e74\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u6b62\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u738b\u8005\u304b\u3089\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u7406\u7531", "- AOL\u306b\u8cb7\u53ce\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6700\u5f8c\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u304b\u3089ISP\u3078", "- \u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7ISP\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u6b7b\u306b\u304b\u3051\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u518d\u751f", "- \u304b\u3064\u3066\u306e\u6804\u5149\u306e\u540d\u6b8b\uff1a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f8c", "- 2025\u5e74\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u6ec5\u3057\u305f\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7ISP\u306e\u60b2\u5287\u7684\u7d42\u7109"]}

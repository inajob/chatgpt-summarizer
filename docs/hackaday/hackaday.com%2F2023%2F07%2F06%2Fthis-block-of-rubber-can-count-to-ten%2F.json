Its a straightforward implementation of the work of two physicists from the Netherlands: [Martin van Hecke] and [Lennard Kwakernaak].\nThis device brings flexures to mind, which are also examples of obtaining complex and useful behavior from seemingly simple objects. Weve seen flexures used as latches and counters, and weve seen 3D printed flexures as a kind of linear actuator.\nYou can check out the research paper for more details on the rubber beam counter. [Kwakernaak] aims to create a much more complex structure with elements that interact across a plane instead of in a single direction. Such a device would, in effect, be a simple computer.\nWatch the beam counter in action in the short video embedded below. See how the elements of the green rubber block move while constrained by an outer frame that helps control the force that is applied. The thin beams flip from left to right, one at a time with each press.\n\n"}

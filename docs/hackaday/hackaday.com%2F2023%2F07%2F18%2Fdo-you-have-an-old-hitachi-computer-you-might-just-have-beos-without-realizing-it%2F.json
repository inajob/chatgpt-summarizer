The various commercial contenders slipped by the wayside or survived by the skin of their teeth as enthusiast or niche platforms, while Microsoft Windows steamrollered all before it except for the walled garden of Apple users.\nOne of the players was BeOS, a powerful multimedia OS that might have had a chance if it could have persuaded OEMs to ship it on some PCs, but in that endeavour it had no luck. Or so everyone thought, but [Thom Holwerda] reports on the fascinating tale of a PC that shipped with BeOS, but not in a way anyone could easily use.\nIt seems that even being seen to talk to the folks from Be was enough to ensure an OEM received a visit from Microsoft goons sales representatives so even though the rival OS was offered for free it received no PC takers. This was the received opinion, but it turns out that the one manufacturer which did include BeOS was Hitachi, in Japan. Their Flora Prius PC was a Pentium II equipped white box typical of late-90s multimedia hardware, and though it booted into Windows it also had a BeOS installation on board that probably very few owners would have even realised existed. It seems Hitachi did the deal with Be but didnt install the required bootloader to use the Be partition. A Flora Prius owner could run the software if they were prepared to follow some instructions on the Be website and download a floppy image, but it seems very few did so.\nAll this leads to a fascinating challenge for todays BeOS enthusiasts, to locate a surviving Flora Prius PC if any can still be found with an intact BeOS partition, and activate the only factory PC BeOS install. We know we have readers in Japan who almost certainly have an eye for an old computer, can any of you help them in this quest?\nWeve touched on BeOS in the past on its own BeBox platform and the elusive Sony eVilla internet appliance.", "title": "\u30d3\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\uff08BeOS\uff09\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d7\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9PC\u306e\u5b58\u5728", "body": "16\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u308932\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u671f\u9593\u306b\u3001BeOS\u304c\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30d7\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9PC\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u3001BeOS\u306e\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3053\u306ePC\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3001BeOS\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d3\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\uff08BeOS\uff09\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d7\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9PC\u306e\u5b58\u5728", "\u30d3\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\uff08BeOS\uff09\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u306ePC\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "\u30d3\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\uff08BeOS\uff09\u306e\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3084\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066PC\u3092\u6d3b\u6027\u5316", "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300c\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d7\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9PC\u300d\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u6027", "\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d7\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9PC\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u96a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d3\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\uff08BeOS\uff09\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6"]}

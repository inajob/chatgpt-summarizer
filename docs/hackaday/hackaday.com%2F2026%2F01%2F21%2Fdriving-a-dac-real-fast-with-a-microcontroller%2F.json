However, [Anabit] figured out a way to do the same thing with a microcontroller, thanks to the magic of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2.\nThe design in question is referred to as the PiWave 150 MS/s Bipolar DAC, and as the name suggests, its capable of delivering a full 150 million samples per second with 10, 12, or 14 bits of resolution. Achieving that with a microcontroller would normally be pretty difficult. In regular linear operation, its hard to clock bits out to GPIO pins at that sort of speed. However, the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 serves as a special case in this regard, thanks to its Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem. Its a state machine, able to be programmed to handle certain tasks entirely independently from the microcontrollers main core itself, and can do simple parallel tasks very quickly. Since it can grab data from RAM and truck it out to a bank of GPIO pins in a single clock cycle, its perfect for trucking out data to a DAC in parallel at great speed. The Pi Pico 2s clock rate tops out at 150 MHz, which delivers the impressive 150 MS/s sample rate.\nThe explainer video is a great primer on how this commodity microcontroller is set up to perform this feat in detail. If youre trying for accuracy over speed, weve explored solutions for that as well. Video after the break.\n\n"}

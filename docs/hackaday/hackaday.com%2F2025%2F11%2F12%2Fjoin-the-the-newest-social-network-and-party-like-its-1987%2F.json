Datamining? Brainrot? You dont need those things to have a social network. As we knew back in the BBS days, long before anyone coined the phrase social network, all you need is a place for people to make text posts. [euklides] is providing just such a place, at cyberspace.online.\nIts a great mix of old and new  the IRC inspired chatrooms, e-mail inspired DMs (cybermail) make it feel like the good old days, while a sprinkling of more modern concepts such as friends lists, a real-time feed, and even the late-lamented poke feature (from before Facebook took over the world) provide some welcome conveniences.\nThe pursuit of retro goes further through the themed web interface, as well. Sure, theres light mode and dark mode, but thats de rigueur. Threads might not offer a blue-and-white Commodore 64 theme, and youd have little luck getting Bluesky to mimic the soothing amber glow of a VT-230, but Cyberspace offers that and more.\n\n\nIts also niche enough that theres nobody here but us chickens. That is, it looks like a site for geeks, nerds, tech enthusiasts  whatever you want to call us  it might just be via security by obscurity, but Cyberspace doesnt seem likely to attract quite the same Eternal September the rest of the internet is drowning under.\nIn the Reddit thread where the project was announced, theres talk of a CLI tool under development. In Rust, because thats just what all the cool kids are using these days it seems. A text-based interface, be it under DOS or something POSIX-compliant, seems like it would be the perfect fit for this delightful throwback site.\nIf nobody will join your homebuilt BBS, this might be the next best thing. For those of you who wonder where the hack is: this is a one-man show. If making your own social network in a cave with a box of scraps doesnt count as a hack, what does?\nThanks to [spiritplumber] for the tip."}

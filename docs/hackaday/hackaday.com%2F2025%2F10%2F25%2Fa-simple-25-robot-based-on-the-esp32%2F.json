This small wheeled robot is based on an ESP32 and made using cardboard and hot glue.\nYou drive the contraption using a Bluetooth game controller thanks to the Bluepad32 library, which boasts a long list of supported hardware.\u00a0[Paul] provides a Bill of Materials (BoM), complete with current component pricing. We dont know about you, but it struck us as funny that the microcontroller is less expensive than the battery! Ah, the times we live in. Also [Paul] assumes you already have an appropriate Bluetooth controller and doesnt include that in the total cost.\n\nThe software and related material is available on GitHub: github.com/paulemccabe1/DirtCheapRobot. The Arduino-flavored source code is here: DirtCheapRobot_Code.ino.\nAt time of writing [Paul]s next steps are listed as:\n\nInvestigate ESP32 boards with built in LiPo charging so a smaller LiPo battery with a JST connector can be used\nEliminate use of the breadboard\nCreate Soccer Robot with linear actuator for kicking\n\nWe wish [Paul] every success. If youre interested in cheap robots you might be interested in a cheap robotic mower or a cheap robotic microscope.\n"}

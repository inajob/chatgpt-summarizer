The format has many strengths, but space efficiency isnt one of them. In fact, when it comes to 3D printing in particular file sizes can get awfully large. Partly to address this, Prusa have proposed a new .bgcode binary G-code format. You can read the specification of the new (and optional) format here.\nThe newest version of PrusaSlicer has support for .bgcode, and a utility to convert ASCII G-code to binary (and back) is in the File menu. Want to code an interface of your own? The libbgcode repository provides everything needed to flip .gcode to .bgcode (with a huge file size savings in the process) and vice versa in a way that preserves all aspects of the data. Need to hand-edit a binary G-code file? Convert it to ASCII G-code, make your changes, then flip it right back.\nPrusa are not the only ones to notice that the space inefficiency of the G-code file format is not ideal in all situations. Heatshrink and MeatPack are two other solutions in this space with their own strong points. Handily, the command-line tool in libgcode can optionally apply Heatshrink compression or MeatPack encoding in the conversion process.\nIn a way, G-code is the assembly language of 3D printers. G-code files are normally created when slicing software processes a 3D model, but there are some interesting tricks to be done when G-code is created directly.", "title": "\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011Prusa\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30eaG-code\u5f62\u5f0f\u3092\u63d0\u6848\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u5927\u5e45\u306a\u7bc0\u7d04\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "body": "Prusa proposes .bgcode format for 3D printing G-code to save file space.

Usually an LED would light up to show you were running at this higher speed, or if youre machine was very fancy, it might even have a numerical display that would show the current CPU frequency.\n[Joshua Woehlke] wanted to add a similar display to his 486, but figured that with modern technology, he could do something a bit more interesting. Especially when he realized that the spot on his case where the two-digit LED display would have originally been mounted was the perfect size to hold a common 0.96\u2033 SSD1306 OLED. From there it was just a matter of wiring it up to an Arduino and writing some code to display different graphics depending on the computers current CPU speed.\nJust like the frequency indicators of yore, the Arduino doesnt actually measure the CPUs frequency, its simply reading the state of the Turbo LED on the front panel. When the LED is off the Arduino shows an image of a i8088 CPU on the screen to indicate the computer is running in compatibility mode, and when the LED is on, the screen shows the Cyrix Cx486 DX2 logo. When the button hasnt been pressed in awhile, the display defaults to a star field screensaver.\nRegular readers may recall we recently covered a similar project that used an Arduino to add a little flair to an era appropriate seven-segment LED display. Wed say theres still a good deal of romanticism about computers having a big TURBO button you can smash whenever you feel the need for speed."}

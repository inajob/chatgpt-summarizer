Perhaps when its a Pi Zero-shaped board with an RP3A0 SoC from a Raspberry Pi Zero 2, made by [jonny12375].\nBack in the early days of the Raspberry Pi, there was a offering from the Korean manufacturer Odroid, which wasnt merely a similar machine with a different SoC, but a full clone in a smaller form factor featuring the same BCM2385 chip as the original. It was electrically and software-wise identically to the real thing, which we suspect didnt go down very well with the Pi folks in Cambridge. The supply of Broadcom chips dried up, and ever since then the only way to get a real Pi has been from the official source. Thats not quite the end of the unofficial Pi story though, because a few hardy experimenters have made Pi clones like this one using chips desoldered from the real thing.\nIts the fruit of a reverse-engineering project to find the chips pinout, and its a proof of concept board rather than the intended final target of the work. The process involved painstakingly sanding down each layer of a Zero 2 board to reveal the traces and vias. The current board has a few quirks but it boots, making this an impressive piece of work on all counts. Were looking forward to seeing whatever the final project will be.\nIf youre hungry for more Pi-derived goodness, weve also seen one using the part form a Pi 3."}

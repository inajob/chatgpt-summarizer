Instead of dealing with powder printers or metal-bearing polymers, [Robert] has a simple solution. Using a process known as mechanical plating or peen plating, he deposits a layer of copper on a PLA print. The results look good, as you can see in the video below.\nThis isnt electroplating, although the result is similar. With electroplating, you have to make the 3D part conductive. You also have to deal with wet chemistry and fumes. This process uses a rock tumbler, copper powder, and small ball bearings.\n\nThe ball bearings hammer the copper into the part, cold welding it to the surface. [Roberts] first attempt didn\u00b4t work well as the copper didnt stick well. He solved that by dipping the part in acetone. The video says that made the part sticky, but we havent found that to be true with PLA. We suspect it served to clean the part, an essential step in mechanical plating.\nMechanical plating is a well-known industrial process. Unlike electroplating, it can plate hard-to-reach recesses. It also doesnt cause hydrogen embrittlement like traditional electroplating.\nIf you want to try regular electroplating, we have seen that done many times. If you have patience, you can even use electroplating as a 3D printing process.\n"}

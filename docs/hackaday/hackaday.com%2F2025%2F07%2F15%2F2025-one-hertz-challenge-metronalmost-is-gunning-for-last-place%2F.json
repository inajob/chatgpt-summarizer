The gap is around the value we explicitly asked for.\nThe mathematics required to aggressively subvert our contest are actually kind of interesting: start with a gaussian distribution, such as you can expect from a random number generator. Then subtract a second, narrower distribution centered on one (the value we, the judges want to see) to create a notch function. This disribution can be flipped into a mapping function, but rather than compute this on the MCU, it looks like [Mike] has written a lookup table to map values from his random number generator. The output values range from 0.5 to 1.5, but never, ever, ever 1.0.\nThe whole thing goes into a cardboard box, because you cant hit last place with a masterfully-crafted enclosure. On the other hand, he did print out and glue on some fake woodgrain that looks as good as some 1970s objects weve owned, so there might be room for (un)improvement there.\nWhile we cant think of a better subversion of this contests goals, theres still time to come up with something that misses the point even more dramatically if you want to compete with [Mike] for last place: the contest deadline is 9:00 AM Pacific time on August 19th.\nOr, you know, if you wanted to actually try and win. Whatever ticks your tock.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u65b0\u611f\u899a\u306e\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0\u300cMetronalmost\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u300c\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u9045\u3044\u300eMetronalmost\u300f\u3092\u63d0\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u300d", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u611f\u899a\u306e\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0\u300cMetronalmost\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 1Hz\u3092\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u5916\u3059\uff01\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5275\u9020\u529b\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u9006\u3092\u884c\u304f\uff01\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3055"]}

Its a protocol designed to enable easier aircraft monitoring, and it just so happens you can decode it yourself with the right hardware and software  which is how [John McNelly] came to develop ADSBee, an open source ADS-B receiver based around an RP2040.\nADS-B uses on\u2013off keying (OOK) at 1 Mbps, and operates at 1090 MHz. This might seem like a rather difficult protocol to decode on a microcontroller, but the RP2040s PIO is up to the task. All it takes is a bit of optimization, and a some basic RF components to amplify and digitize the signals.\nHowever, not all aircraft utilize the 1090 MHz ADS-B implementation, and instead use a related protocol called UAT. Operating at 978 MHz, a second receiver is needed for decoding UAT traffic data, which is where the CC1312 comes into play. ADSBee may even be the first open source implementation of a UAT decoder!\nWhats quite impressive is the various form factors the module is available in. Ranging from small solder-down modules to weatherproof outdoor base stations, nearly every potential need for an ADS-B receiver is covered. With POE or ESP32 S3 options available, there is no shortage of networking options either!\nADSBees have been placed in numerous locations, ranging from base stations to drones. One user even built out a tiny flight display cluster complete with traffic indicators into an FPV drone.\nThis isnt the first time we have seen ADS-B receivers used by drone enthusiasts, but this is certainly the most feature rich and complete receiver we have come across.", "title": "- RP2040\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eADS-B\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u300cADSBee\u300d", "body": "ADS-B\u3092\u53d7\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u300cADSBee\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u3068\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306a\u3069\u306b\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- RP2040\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eADS-B\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u300cADSBee\u300d", "- ADS-B\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u8aad\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u304b\u3089\u9632\u6c34\u578b\u307e\u3067\u3001\u591a\u69d8\u306aADS-B\u53d7\u4fe1\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb", "- UAT\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6700\u65b0\u306eADS-B\u30c7\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "- \u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u306eADS-B\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f"]}

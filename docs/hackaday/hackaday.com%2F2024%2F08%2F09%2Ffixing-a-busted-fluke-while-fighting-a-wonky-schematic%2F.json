Heck, weve got a Fluke 73 that we bought back in 1985 thats still a daily driver. But just because theyve been making them forever doesnt mean they last forever, and getting a secondhand meter back in the game can be a challenge. Thats what [TheHWCave] learned with his revival of a wonky eBay Fluke 25, an effort that holds lessons for anyone in the used Fluke market.\nInitial inspection of the meter showed encouragingly few signs of abuse, somewhat remarkable for something built for the military in the early 1980s. A working display allowed a few simple diagnostics revealing that the ammeter functions seemed to work, but not the voltmeter and ohmmeter functions. [TheHWCave]s teardown revealed a solidly constructed unit with no obvious signs of damage or blown fuses. Thankfully, a service schematic was available online, albeit one with a frustrating lack of detail, confusing test point nomenclature, and contradictory component values.\nDespite these hurdles, [TheHWCave] was able to locate the culprit: a bad fusible power resistor. Finding a direct replacement wasnt easy given the vagaries of the schematic and the age of the instrument, but he managed to track down a close substitute cheap enough to buy in bulk. He searched through 40 units to find the one closest to the listed specs, which got the meter going again. Fixing the bent pin also gave the meter back its continuity beeper, always a mixed blessing.\nIf youre in the market for a meter but cant afford the Fluke name, picking up a busted meter and fixing it up like this might be one way to go. But are they really worth the premium? Well, kinda yes.\n\n", "title": "\u4e2d\u53e4\u306eFluke 25\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "body": "1985\u5e74\u306b\u8cfc\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305fFluke 73\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u4e2d\u53e4\u306eFluke\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u6311\u6226\u3002TheHWCave\u306feBay\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305fFluke 25\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u3001\u8ab2\u984c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3002\u7d50\u8ad6\u306f\u3001\u4e2d\u53e4\u306eFluke\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\uff1f", "titles": ["\u4e2d\u53e4\u306eFluke 25\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "Fluke 25\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6210\u529f\uff01 \u4e2d\u53e4\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af", "Fluke 25\u306e\u6545\u969c\u539f\u56e0\u7a76\u660e\u3068\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u4f7f\u3044\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u6551\u51fa", "\u4e2d\u53e4Fluke 25\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u8853\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u3092\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u547d\u3067\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b", "\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u4e2d\u53e4Fluke\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u4fa1\u5024"]}

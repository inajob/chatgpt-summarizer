The Raspberry Pi, for instance, or the mechanical keyboard, with a 3D printed body. [RobsonCuto]s KOAT0 Portable Terminal has some of those in a particularly slim and neat design. The orange and grey color scheme is great really pops. Where this deck really shines though, is the display.\u00a0 Hes eschewed LCDs or OLEDs, even CRTs, and gone for an unusual choice in a dot-matrix VFD.\nThe VFD in question is commonly available on AliExpress where it appears to be used for displaying Chinese characters. Its not an obvious choice for a cyberdeck, so once the tidy-looking case is complete the real challenge in this project becomes how to drive it from the Pi. To that end, he appears to have some kind of text output working but still needs to complete a framebuffer driver. We applaud the effort and we really like the display.\u00a0 Were curious as to how its meager resolution might best be used in a Linux device.\nAll in all, this is a deck wed be happy to use ourselves if it were an option. We particularly like the on-the-arm style of use, and were pretty sure its the first time weve seen one of these displays on these pages.\n \n\n", "title": "\u8584\u578b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306eKOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u4e2d\u83ef\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3067\u304d\u308bVFD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306f\u7279\u306b\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001Pi\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u958b\u767a\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9014\u4e2d\u3002\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u5148\u3067\u521d\u3081\u3066\u898b\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u8584\u578b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306eKOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30af\u3001KOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb", "\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u9078\u629e\u3092\u3057\u305fKOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u306eVFD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fKOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "Linux\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aKOAT0\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u4f4e\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4"]}

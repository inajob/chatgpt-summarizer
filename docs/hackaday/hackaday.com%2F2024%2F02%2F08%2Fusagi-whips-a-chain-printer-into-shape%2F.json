[Usagi Electric] shows us its not too hard, even if you dont exactly know what youre doing.\u00a0 When we last left this project, [Usagi Electric] had tested and verified his\u00a0 power supply was working. This week, after a bit of cleaning, it was time to dig into the mechanics.\nIf you havent seen a chain printer in action before, definitely check one out. Theyre big, loud, and sound a bit like a turbine when they spool up. The type chains on these printers never stops moving. This means the printer has to know exactly where a particular letter is before launching one of 66 hammers at it. If the timing is off, parts will fly. To the average computer user, theyre quite intimidating.\nThankfully [Usagis] printer was in pretty good shape. When he flipped the big power switch, there was plenty of strange noises, culminating in the test pattern of dollar signs.\u00a0 Probably an early reminder to customers that they needed to order more print supplies.\n\nThe print quality wasnt exactly stellar though. There were dark columns and, smeared characters. Some $s were missing altogether. These printers have a ton of adjustments, but the problem in this case turned out to be a mylar spacer located behind the hammers. The mylar acts as a cushion between the hammers and other parts of the printer.Time had not been kind to this part. It was worn through and cut into several pieces.\u00a0 A mylar folder made the perfect replacement.\nWith a few tweaks complete, the printer delivered a perfect page.\u00a0 But the success didnt last. The next page arrived with even more problems.\u00a0 When the paper spitting from the top of the printer gets too heavy, it folds over. That was enough to bring the dark columns back.\u00a0 Hopefully, this problem will be solved when [Usagi] installs the paper guides back on the printer. Until then, were waiting patiently for the next installment of Raiders of the lost ribbon\n\n", "title": "\"47\u6b73\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306b\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\uff1fUsagi Electric\u304c\u305d\u306e\u624b\u9806\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\"", "body": "47\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u306b\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u30a6\u30b5\u30ae\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u304b\u304b\u308b\u524d\u306b\u5c11\u3057\u6383\u9664\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306f\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u5f8c\u308d\u306b\u3042\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30de\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u51fa\u529b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u554f\u984c\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3002\u7d19\u304c\u91cd\u304f\u306a\u308a\u6298\u308a\u66f2\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9ed2\u3044\u5217\u304c\u623b\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\"47\u6b73\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306b\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\uff1fUsagi Electric\u304c\u305d\u306e\u624b\u9806\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\"", "\"\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3084\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u60a9\u3080\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5370\u5237\u54c1\u8cea\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\"", "\"\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u7d9a\u304f\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u7d19\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u3067\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u304b\"", "\"Raiders of the lost ribbon: \u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u8fbf\u308b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\""]}

From art robots that burp and belch to gliders returning from near-space, from hardcore DSP to DIY PCBs, and sketching with machines, Hackadays Supercon is like nothing else out there.\nAnd in case youre already coming, you dont have a talk slot reserved, but youve still got something that you want to say, please sign yourself up for a Lightning Talk! In the spirit of the Lightning, well be taking submissions up to the absolute last minute, and we will fit in as many short talks as possible, but when it does fill up, well be giving priority to those who got in first.\nWeve got one more speaker announce coming up, and of course our keynote speaker and the badge reveal. Supercon will sell out so get your tickets now before its too late. So without further ado, here is our next round of stellar speakers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherine Connell\nSprite Lights: LED Body Art\nSprite Lights are 1.5 mm thick LED body art, think a light up temporary tattoo. Join Katherine Smalls Connell to hear about the 6-year journey to create the impossible as a self taught maker. From hundreds of rapid prototypes, and smelting metal in her driveway to reflowing home made flexible circuits on a griddle, Sprite Lights is a testament that when youre willing to try anything, you can create everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Rowley\nUsing an Oscilloscope to Peek Below the Noise Floor\nIn this talk, we will explore the DSP magic that allows lock-in amplifiers to detect signals hidden below the noise floor. By making a change to the measurement setup, these devices can isolate and measure faint signals amidst noise a hundred dB higher. Lock-in amplifiers are used in various applications, from sensitive photonics research to next-generation battery research and quantum computing.\nWell also show you how to use your oscilloscope as a lock-in amplifier, enabling a low-cost entry point to these niche instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNanik Adnani\nA Hacker\u2019s Guide to Analog Design in a Digital World\nWhen someone says analog design \u2013 what do you think of? If I had to guess I would say you don\u2019t associate it with modern technology. And yet \u2013 analog circuits and the designers that build them play a critical role in every modern electronic device, especially the digital ones. In this talk I will provide an overview of the incredible analog circuits in our pockets, and often already in our projects. Once you\u2019re convinced \u2013 I\u2019ll show that analog design isn\u2019t as hard as you think and how a few simple concepts can significantly improve your next project, while providing examples with some of mine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin McAllister and Nick Foster\nFinding Beamo  from interference to numbers stations, how to track down radio transmissions\nIn a world increasingly reliant on wireless communication, the ability to track down and understand the sources of radio transmissions has never been more critical. From identifying interference in urban environments to the enigmatic world of numbers stations, Finding Beamo will take the audience on a journey through the fascinating and often mysterious world of locating radio transmissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandy Glenn\nYes, you CAN use the Controller Area Network outside of cars\nThe Controller Area Network (CAN) is used in cars, trains, buses, planes, and spacecraft  but its useful for all sorts of cases where systems need to communicate. Ill talk about how you can use this technology to transfer data between microcontrollers and larger computers, and will present an example application that you can use as a starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYohan Hadji\nUltralight Glider Returns Home from the Stratosphere \nThis talk will give you an overview of all the technical challenges to solve to get a sub-250g UAV to autonomously return to home after releasing from a stratospheric balloon at 100,000 ft altitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZach Fredin\nThe Circuit Graver\nWe all must strive to minimize iteration time. Designing and testing an idea in a single sitting spawns great things! Its why we visit fab labs and love laser cutters and push the 3D printers in the corners of our apartments to the absolute limit. But circuit tools havent kept up; once youre done mashing together breakout boards, your choices of milling, conductive-pasting, or home etching all leave a bit to be desired; theyre often messy, delicate, and lack the precision to reach the funnest parts in the catalog. Ugh, I need to go smaller than SOICs, and I dont want to wait a week for commercial boards!\nHere, I present and freely share significant progress on a novel method Ive been poking at over the last few years which demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating 4/4 PCBs at home!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriyanka Makin\nTech to Hack Embodiment\nTech constantly takes us out of the present moment and beckons us into the internet wormhole, but can we use technology to explore our emotions and root us in the now or even our physical bodies? At supercon, I would love to talk about my Body of Work series and how I used technology to interrogate my own embodiment.\nMy Body of Work is a series of tech-powered body part sculptures that relate to my own relationship with my body and come together to make an unconventional self-portrait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair Subbaraman\nSketching with Machines\nArtists, craftspeople, and scientists are highly skilled makers. Yet, software for making physical things often overlooks existing skill sets, forcing practitioners to work against built-in assumptions to accomplish their goals. Using examples from digital art, ceramics, and plant biology, this talk will consider how creative practices can guide the development of digital fabrication systems and communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEduardo Contreras\nCats Turned Plumbers: Embedded Linux Adventures\nA bit of our journey deploying embedded Linux systems, and integrating drivers on the Linux kernels, from the hardware, to the kernel.\n\n\n\n\n\n[If you read this far, you probably want tickets. Just sayin.]"}

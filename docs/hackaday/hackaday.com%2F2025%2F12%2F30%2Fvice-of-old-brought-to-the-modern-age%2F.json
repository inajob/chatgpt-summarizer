This doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t use a refresh. [Marius Hornberger] recently backed that up when he decided to restore an old vice that had seen better days.\nCustomized axial bearing assembly\nWhen refreshing old tools, you\u2019ll almost always start the same: cleaning up all the layers of grease and ruined paint. The stories that each layer could tell will never be known, but new ones will be made with the care put into it by [Marius]. Bearings for the tightening mechanism had become worn down past saving, requiring new replacements. However, simply swapping them with carbon copies would be no fun.\n[Marius] decided to completely rethink the clamping mechanism, allowing for much smoother use. To do this was simple, just machine down new axial bearings, design and print a bearing cage, machine the main rod itself, and finally make a casing. It\u2019s simple really, but he wasn\u2019t done and decided to create a custom torque rod to hammer in his vicing abilities. Importantly, the final finish was done by spraying paint and applying new grease.\nOld tools can often be given new life, and we are far from strangers to this concept at Hackaday.

What about when you couldnt have, but did anyway? The 555 is famously easy to use, but not exactly the most accurate timer out there  one ticking at 1 Hz will pulse just about once per second (probably to within a millisecond, depending on the rest of the circuit), but when you need more precise timing, the 555 just wont cut it. Not on its own, anyway.\nAllan Deviation can be a bit confusing, but generally  lower is more accurate\nThis entry by [burble] shows us how the humble 555 can hold its own in more demanding systems with some help from a GPS receiver. He used the One Pulse per Second (1PPS) output from a GPS module to discipline the 1 Hz output from a 555 by modulating the control voltage with a microcontroller.\nOkay, this sounds a bit like baking a cake by buying a cake, scraping all the icing off, then icing it yourself, but what better way to learn how to ice a cake? The GPS-disciplined 555 is way more accurate than a free running one  just check out that Allan Deviation plot. While the accuracy of the standard 555 begins to decrease as oscillator drift dominates, the GPS-disciplined version just keeps getting better (up to a point  it would also eventually begin to increase, if the data were recorded for long enough). Compared to other high-end oscillators though, [burble] describes the projects accuracy in one word: Badly.\nThats okay though  it really is a fantastic investigation into how GPS-disciplined oscillators work, and does a fantastic job illustrating the accuracy of different types of clocks, and some possible sources of error. This project is a great addition to some of the other precision timekeeping projects weve seen here at Hackaday, and a very fitting entry to the competition. Think you can do better? Or much, much worse? Youve got a few weeks left to enter!\n \n\n\n", "title": "- GPS\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "GPS\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3084\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "titles": ["- GPS\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- 555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3068GPS\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5316", "- \u81ea\u4f5c555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u7cbe\u5bc6\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\uff01555\u30bf\u30a4\u30de\u30fc\u3092GPS\u3067\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

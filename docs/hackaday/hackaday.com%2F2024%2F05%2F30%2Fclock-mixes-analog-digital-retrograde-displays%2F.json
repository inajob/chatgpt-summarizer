Word clocks are perhaps on the easier side of non-traditional displays but at the other end are binary clocks or even things like QR code clocks. To get the best of both worlds, though, multiple clock faces can be combined into one large display like this clock build from [imitche3].\nThe clock is actually three clocks in one. The first was inspired by a binary clock originally found in a kit, which has separate binary digits for hour, minute, and second and retains the MAX 7219 LED controller driving the display. A standard analog clock rests at the top, and a third clock called a retrograde clock sits at the bottom with three voltmeters that read out the time in steps. Everything is controlled by an Arduino Nano with the reliable DS3231 keeping track of time. The case can be laser-cut or 3D printed and [imitche3] has provided schematics for both options.\nAs far as clocks builds go, we always appreciate something which can be used to tell the time without needing any legends, codes, or specialized knowledge. Of course, if you want to take a more complex or difficult clock face some of the ones were partial to are this QR code clock which needs a piece of hardware to tell the time that probably already has its own clock on it.", "title": "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\uff1a\u8907\u6570\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u4e00\u3064\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u3055\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3092\u7df4\u7fd2\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u6642\u9593\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3002[imitche3]\u306e3\u3064\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u5927\u304d\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306f\u3001\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u6642\u8a08\u3084QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u542b\u3080\u975e\u5e38\u8b58\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u3002\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6642\u8a08\u3001\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u6642\u8a08\u3001\u30ea\u30c8\u30ed\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306fArduino Nano\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\uff1a\u8907\u6570\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u4e00\u3064\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u3055\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u306f\uff1a\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304b\u3089\u975e\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u307e\u3067\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Arduino Nano\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08\uff1a\u6642\u523b\u8868\u793a\u306bArduino Nano\u3068DS3231\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u307e\u305f\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8a73\u7d30", "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\uff1aQR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6642\u8a08\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u96e3\u89e3\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

But even before that, there were a set of computers that often had no keyboard, or recognizable display beyond a few blinking lights. [Artem Kalinchuk] is attempting to recreate one of these very early digital computers, the Kenbak-1, using as many period-correct parts as possible.\nConsidered by many to be the worlds first personal computer, the Kenbak-1 was an 8-bit machine with 256 bytes of memory, using TTL integrated circuits for the logic as there was no commercially available microprocessor available at the time it was designed. For [Artem]s build, most of these parts can still be sourced including the 7400-series chips and carbon resistors although the shift registers were a bit of a challenge to find. A custom PCB was built to replicate the original, and with all the parts in order its ready to be assembled and put into a case which was built using the drawings for the original unit.\nAlthough [Artem] plans to build a period-correct linear power supply for this computer, right now hes using a modern switching power supply for testing. The only other major components that are different are the status lamps, in this case switched to LEDs because he wasnt able to source incandescent bulbs that drew low enough current, and the switches which hes replaced with MX-style keys. Well stay tuned as he builds and tests this over the course of several videos, but in the meantime if youre curious how this early computer actually worked we featured an emulator for it a while back.\n\n", "title": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001Kenbak-1\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cKenbak-1\u300d\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u5f53\u6642\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u30018\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u3001256\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3053\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306fTTL\u96c6\u7a4d\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3001\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001Kenbak-1\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30da\u30ea\u30aa\u30c9\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fKenbak-1\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u306b\u6311\u6226", "Kenbak-1: \u521d\u306e\u500b\u4eba\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fKenbak-1\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "\u65e9\u671f\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001Kenbak-1\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

If you miss those days but dont want to install a modern interpreter, you dont have to. Just load a web page containing the BASIC Anywhere Machine from [CJ Veniot]. Worried about it being in the cloud? It isnt? It runs in your browser, and if you are a TiddlyWiki fan, it will even live inside your Wiki, which you can host as you please.\nThe project has lots of features, including some integration back into TiddlyWiki, which we havent tried. But you can use graphics commands, work with the mouse, and do other fun things.\n\nThe only peculiarity is that the program pops up in a window that resembles an old Commodore 64 screen. Depending on why you want to use this, that could be an advantage or a disadvantage. You can see a nice plot running from a TiddlyWiki topic in the title image. Heres the Tiddler:\nThe code behind the wave\nThe BASIC Anywhere Machine is highly modified from Googles wwwBASIC, which is fun, too. Since weve covered TiddlyWiki before, we are a little ashamed we didnt think to marry those two codebases ourselves!"}

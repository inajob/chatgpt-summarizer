The magnetic compass is a great example  a magnetized needle, a bit of cork, and a bowl of water are all you need to start navigating the globe. So why in the world would you want to over-complicate things with something like this Earth inductor compass? Just because its cool, of course.\nNow, the thing with complication is that its often instructive. The simplicity of the magnetic compass masks the theory behind its operation to some degree and completely fails to deliver any quantitative data on the Earths magnetic field. [tsbrownie]s gadget is built from a pair of electric motors, one intact and one stripped of its permanent magnet stators. The two are mounted on a 3D printed frame and coupled by a long shaft made of brass, to magnetically isolate them as much as possible. The motor is powered by a DC supply while a digital ammeter is attached to the terminals on the stator.\nWhen the motor spins, the stator at the other end of the shaft cuts the Earths magnetic lines of force and generates a current, which is displayed on the ammeter. How much current is generated depends on how the assembly is oriented. In the video below, [tsbrownie] shows that the current nulls out when oriented along the east-west axis, and reaches a maximum along north-south. Its not much current  about 35 microamps  but its enough to get a solid reading.\nIs this a practical substitute for a magnetic compass? Perhaps not for most use cases, but a wind-powered version of this guided [Charles Lindbergh]s Spirit of St. Louis across the Atlantic in 1927 with an error of only about 10 miles over the trip, so theres that. Other aircraft compasses take different approaches to the problem of nulling out the magnetic field of the plane.\n\n"}

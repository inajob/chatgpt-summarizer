Since [Markus Bindhammer] is building a hybrid rocket engine, in his most recent video he built and tested a convenient nitrous oxide dispenser.\nThe most commercially available form of nitrous oxide is as a propellant for whipped cream, for which it is sold as \u201ccream chargers,\u201d basically small cartridges of nitrous oxide which fit into cream dispensers. Each cartridge holds about eight grams of gas, or four liters at standard temperature and pressure. To use these, [Markus] bought a cream dispenser and disassembled it for the cartridge fittings, made an aluminium adapter from those fittings to a quarter-inch pipe, and installed a valve. As a quick test, he fitted a canister in, attached it to a hose, lit some paraffin firelighter, and directed a stream of nitrous oxide at it, upon which it burned much more brightly and aggressively.\nIt\u2019s not its most well-known attribute in popular culture, but nitrous oxide\u2019s oxidizing potential is behind most of its use by hackers, whether in racing or in rocketry. [Markus] is no stranger to working with nitrogen oxides, including the much more aggressively oxidizing nitrogen dioxide.\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4e9c\u9178\u5316\u7a92\u7d20\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30cb\u30c8\u30ed\u30a6\u30b9\u30aa\u30ad\u30b7\u30c9\u306f\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u71c3\u6599\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3001\u5b9f\u9a13\u8005\u304c\u5674\u5c04\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4e9c\u9178\u5316\u7a92\u7d20\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4e9c\u9178\u5316\u7a92\u7d20\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58", "- \u30d1\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u4e9c\u9178\u5316\u7a92\u7d20\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u4e9c\u9178\u5316\u7a92\u7d20\u306e\u9178\u5316\u529b\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30ed\u30aa\u30ad\u30b7\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u307e\u3067"]}

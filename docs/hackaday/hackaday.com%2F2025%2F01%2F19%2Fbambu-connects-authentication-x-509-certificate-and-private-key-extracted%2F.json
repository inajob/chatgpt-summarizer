This application was intended to be the sole way for third-party software to send print jobs to Bambu Lab hardware as we previously reported.\nThe Bambu Connect app is a fairly low-effort Electron-based affair, with some attempt at obfuscation and encryption, but not enough to keep prying eyes out. The de-obfuscated main.js file can be found here, with the certificate and private key clearly visible. These are used to encrypt HTTP traffic with the printer, and is the sole thing standing in the way of tools like OrcaSlicer talking with authentication-enabled Bambu Lab printers.\nAs for what will be the next steps by Bambu Lab, its now clear that security through obfuscation is not going to be very effective here. While playing whack-a-mole with (paying) users who are only interested in using their hardware in the way that they want is certainly an option, this might be a wake-up call for the company that being more forthcoming with their userbase would be in anyones best interest.\nWe await Bambu Labs response with bated breath.", "title": "Bambu Lab\u3001X1\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u5236\u9650", "body": "Bambu Labs\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u76f4\u9762\u3002\u8a3c\u660e\u66f8\u3068\u9375\u304c\u62bd\u51fa\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Bambu Lab\u3001X1\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u5236\u9650", "Bambu Connect\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304b\u3089\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u8a3c\u660e\u66f8\u304c\u6d41\u51fa", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u5de1\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8ab2\u984c", "Bambu Lab\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5bfe\u7b56\u304c\u554f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u4e2d\u3067\u306e\u53cd\u97ff", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u58f0\u306b\u5fdc\u3048\u308b\u3079\u304dBambu Lab\u306e\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u65b9\u91dd\u306f\uff1f"]}

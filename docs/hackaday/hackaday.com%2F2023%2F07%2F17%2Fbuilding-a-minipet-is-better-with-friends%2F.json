This week theyre building a MiniPET from Tynemouth and The Future is 8 Bit.\u00a0 Its a pretty awesome kit which sadly isnt available anymore. Taylor bought one of the last ones as part of a charity sale at the 2023 Vintage Computer Festival Southwest.\nIf you havent seen their YouTube channel yet, check it out! The two have been best friends since 1984. Their channel has just the right mix of education and comedy, with pacing fast enough to keep things interesting. Its really refreshing to see two people enjoying a project together.\nThe MiniPET is of course a reproduction of the hardware in the Commodore PET, the machine which predated the VIC-20 and of course the Commodore 64. The kit starts with installing a few discrete parts  resistors,\u00a0 capacitors, and diodes.\u00a0 Then come the IC sockets. [Taylor and Amy] ran into a bit of trouble when it came time to install the chips. While installing the 40-pin 65C21 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA), one pin bent under the socket. [Taylor] popped the chip back out, and replaced it  which resulted in 3 bent pins!\nAnyone whos installed new DIP parts has been through this. The pins are always bent out a bit from the factory. The old Bend it in using a table method usually works  but if you want perfect pins, try a pin straightener. These versatile tools can even be 3D printed.\nOnce the pin problems are solved, its time to power up the kit and see if it will work.\u00a0 Thats when we get to see that magic moment when a project first comes to life. Check out the video  youll see what we mean.\n\n"}

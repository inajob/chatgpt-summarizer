The limbs synchronize thanks to the physical interplay between the robots design and its environment. There are some great videos on that project page, so be sure to check it out.\nA kinked soft tube oscillates when supplied with continuous air.\nPowered by a continuous stream of air blown into soft, kinked tubular limbs, the legs oscillate much like the eye-catching tube man many of us have seen by roadsides. At first its chaotic, but the movements rapidly synchronize into a meaningful rhythm that self-synchronizes and adapts. On land, the robot does a sort of hopping gait. In water, it becomes a paddling motion. The result in both cases is a fast little robot that does it all without any actual control system, relying on physics.\nYou can watch it in action in the video, embedded below. The full article \u201cPhysical synchronization of soft self-oscillating limbs for fast and autonomous locomotion\u201d\u00a0is also available.\nGait control is typically a nontrivial problem in robotics, but it doesnt necessarily require a separate control system. Things like BEAM robotics and even the humble bristlebot demonstrate the ability for relatively complex behavior and locomotion to result from nothing more than the careful arrangement of otherwise simple elements.\n\n"}

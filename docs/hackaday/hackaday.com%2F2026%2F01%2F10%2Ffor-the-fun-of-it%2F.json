Inevitably, someone would ask me what my favorite is. Maybe it\u2019s my decision paralysis, maybe it\u2019s being forced to pick a favorite child on the spot, or maybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not walking around ranking them, but that question always left me drawing a blank.\nBut after a week of thinking about it, I\u2019m pretty sure I know why: I don\u2019t actually care what I think of other peoples\u2019 projects! I\u2019m simply stoked to talk to everyone who brought anything, and bathe in the success and failure, hearing about the challenges that they saw coming, and then the new challenges they met along the way. I want to know what the hacker thinks of their project, what their intention was, and how their story went. I\u2019m just a spectator, so I collected stories.\nThe overwhelming, entirely non-surprising result of listening to a couple hundred hackers talk about their projects? They\u2019re all doing it for the fun of it. Simply for the grins. And that held equally well for the supremely planned-out and technical projects as well as their simpler I-bought-these-surplus-on-eBay-one-night relatives. \u201cWe were sitting around and thought, wouldn\u2019t it be fun\u2026\u201d was the start of nearly every story.\nThat\u2019s what I absolutely love about our community: that people are hacking because it makes them happy, and that the amazing variety of projects suggests an endless possibility for hacker happiness. It\u2019s hard to come away from an event like that without being energized. Some of that comes from the sharing of ideas and brainstorming and hanging out with like-minded folks, but what I find most important is simply the celebration of the joy of the project for its own sake.\nHappy hacking!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

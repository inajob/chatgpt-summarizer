These days, inexpensive stations are everywhere. [Kerry Wong] looks at the TS1C station, which is tiny and cordless. As he points out, cordless irons are not new, but modern battery technology has made them much more practical. However, this iron doesnt actually have a battery.\nThe iron has a large 750 Farad supercapacitor. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, a supercapacitor charges quickly and doesnt get weaker with each charging cycle like a conventional battery. On the minus side, the large capacitor makes the unit bulky compared to normal irons. [Kerry] notes that it is ergonomic, though, and he felt comfortable holding it. Also, the supercapacitor limits the amount of charge available while soldering.\nIt is somewhat of a balance, though. If you want to take the iron and climb a tower, you might be very interested in a longer running time. But if you return the unit to the base every few minutes, the fast charging of the cap will compensate for the lower capacity, and youll probably never notice it go flat.\nThe iron itself doesnt display any data. The display is on the base, meaning the devices must be paired via Bluetooth. It also requires a PD-enabled USB-C connection, so you cant just wire it to a battery. You can plug a power supply right into the iron if you prefer, but you still cant use a simple power connection.\nOf course, you assume it does an adequate job of soldering. We wanted to see inside! And [Kerry] didnt disappoint. If you want to see soldering, skip to about the 10-minute marker. The teardown starts at around 16 minutes.\nHonestly, for the bench, wed probably stick with a wired iron. You dont always want a base and a PD power supply for a portable iron. But if you absolutely hate cords, this could be a reasonable answer. Weve seen another review of this iron that didnt like the plastic casings. Maybe it is like Jedi and lightsabers: you should just build your own.\n\n"}

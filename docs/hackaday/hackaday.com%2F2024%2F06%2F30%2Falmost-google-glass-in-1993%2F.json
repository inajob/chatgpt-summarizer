Despite having desk in the name, the imagined prototype was really a wearable computer. Of course, in 1993, the technology wasnt there to actually build it, but it does look like [Krohn] predicted headgear that would augment your experience.\nUnlike Google Glass, the Cyberdesk was worn like a necklace. There are five disk-like parts that form a four-key keyboard and something akin to a trackpad. There were two models built, but since they were nonfunctional, they could have any imagined feature you might like. For example, the system was supposed to draw power from the sun and your body, something practical devices today dont really do, either.\nShe also imagined a wrist-mounted computer with satellite navigation, a phone, and more. Then again, so did [Chester Gould] when he created Dick Tracy. The post also talks about a more modern reimagining of the Cyberdesk last year.\nWhile this wasnt a practical device, it is a great example of how people imagine the future. Sometimes, they miss the mark, but even then, speculative art and fiction can serve as goals for scientists and engineers who build the actual devices of the future.\nWe usually think about machines augmenting our intelligence and senses, but maybe we should consider more physical augmentation. We do appreciate seeing designs that are both artistic and functional.", "title": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\uff1a1993\u5e74\u306b\u60f3\u50cf\u3055\u308c\u305f\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8Lisa Krohn\u304c1993\u5e74\u306bCyberdesk\u3092\u60f3\u50cf\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002Google Glass\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3044\u3001Cyberdesk\u306f\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u7740\u7528\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u592a\u967d\u3084\u4f53\u304b\u3089\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u53d6\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002 \u672a\u6765\u3092\u60f3\u50cf\u3059\u308b\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u826f\u3044\u4f8b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\uff1a1993\u5e74\u306b\u60f3\u50cf\u3055\u308c\u305f\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30ea\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u6b69\u3092\u4e88\u8a00\uff1f", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "\u672a\u6765\u4e88\u60f3\uff1a\u30b5\u30f3\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3084\u8eab\u4f53\u304b\u3089\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u53d6\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af", "\u79d1\u5b66\u8005\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u76ee\u6a19\uff1a\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u3068\u9032\u5316"]}

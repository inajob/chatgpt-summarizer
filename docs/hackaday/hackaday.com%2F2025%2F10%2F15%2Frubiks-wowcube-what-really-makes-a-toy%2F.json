Invented in 1974 by sculptor and professor of architecture Ern\u0151 Rubik with originally the name of\u00a0Magic Cube, it features a three-by-three grid of colored surfaces and an internal mechanism which allows for each of these individual sections of each cube face to be moved to any other face. This makes the goal of returning each face to its original single color into a challenge, one which has both intrigued and vexed many generations over the decades. Maybe youve seen one?\nAlthough there have been some variations of the basic 33 grid cube design over the years, none have been as controversial as the recently introduced WOWCube. Not only does this feature a measly 22 grid on each face, each part of the grid is also a display that is intended to be used alongside an internal processor and motion sensors for digital games. After spending many years in development, the Rubiks WOWCube recently went up for sale at $299, raising many questions about what market its really targeting.\nIs the WOWCube a real Rubiks Cube, and what makes something into a memorable toy and what into a mere novelty gadget that is forgotten by the next year like a plague of fidget spinners?\n\nThe Cubes Genius\nRubiks Cube components with the nylon core visible.

Specifically, the rotation occurs around said internal sphere, with the outer elements interlocked in such a way that they allow for free movement along certain planes. It is this simple design that was turned into a toy by the 1980s, with its popularity surging and never really fading.\nThere are a few definitions of a toy, which basically all come down to an object to play with, meaning something that provides pleasure through act of interacting with it, whether thats in the innocent sense of a childs playing time, or the mind-in-gutter adult sense. These objects are thus effectively without real purpose other than to provide entertainment and potentially inflict basic skills on a developing mind.\nAlthough this may seem like a clear-cut distinction, there is a major grey zone, inside of which we find things like of educational toys and games like chess. These are toys which are explicitly designed to only provide some kind of reward after a puzzle is solved, often requiring various levels of mental exertion.\nIts hard to argue that a Rubiks Cube isnt an educational toy, especially considering its original purpose within the education system. After shuffling the faces of the cube, the goal is to somehow move the individual blocks of color back to their fellow colors on a singular face. This is a process that can be done through a variety of methods, the easiest of which is to recognize the patterns that are formed by the colors.\nGenerally, solving a Rubiks Cube is done algorithmically, using visual recognition of patterns and applying the appropriate response. While a casual Cuber can solve a standard 33 cube in less than half an hour using the basic layer-by-layer algorithm, so-called speedcubers can knock this down to a few seconds by applying far more complicated algorithms. As of May 2025 the world record for fastest single solve stands at 3.05 seconds, achieved by Xuanyi Geng.\nIn this regard, one can easily put Rubiks Cube in the same general toy category as games like chess, go, and shogi. Although the Cube isnt by itself a multiplayer game, it also clearly invites competition and a social atmosphere in which to better oneself at the game.\nDoes It WOW?\nWith the Cube so firmly established in the global communitys psyche and the multi-colored toy a symbol of why paying attention during math classes can absolutely pay off later in life, this brings us to the WOWCube. Looking at the official website for the item, one cant help but feel less than inspired.\nWould you rather play this than solve a Rubiks Cube? (Credit: WOWCube)\nBacking up a bit, the device itself is already a major departure from the Cube. Although the WOWCubes price tag at $299 is absolutely worthy of a Wow, the 22 configuration is decidedly underwhelming. Yes, it rotates like a Cube, and you could use it like a regular 22 Cube if that is your thing and you hate a challenge, but the general vibe is that youre supposed to be playing the equivalent of Flash or phone games on the screens, in addition to using it like a geometrically-challenged\u00a0smartphone to display statuses and notifications.\nFor these applications you have the use of a total of 24 1.4 IPS LC displays, each with a 240 x 240 resolution. Due to the 22 configuration, you have eight blocks that can be moved around, each with its own built-in processor, battery, speaker and 6-axis IMU sensor for gyroscope and accelerometer functionality. These blocks communicate with each other using a magnetic system, and after up to five hours of play time you have to recharge it on the special charger.\nCurrently you can only pre-order the special Rubiks WOWCube, with delivery expected by Christmas 2025. You can however get a good idea of what the experience will be like from videos like the 2022 review video of a pre-production unit by MetalJesusRocks, who also helpfully did a teardown while reconnecting the battery in one block after it disconnected during use.\nThe 2022 preproduction WOWCube with a block removed.

With no touchscreen, you have to sometimes rather violently tap the cube or shake it to register user input, which will likely do wonders for long-term reliability.\nIn the earlier referenced pre-production review, the conclusion was  especially after having a group of random folk try it out  that although definitely an interesting device, its too expensive and too confused about who or what it is targeting. This is also the vibe in a brief production unit review by major gadget YouTube channel\u00a0Mrwhosetheboss, whose Overkill Toys video spent a few minutes fiddling with a 2023-era, $599 Black Edition WOWCube before giving it the impressive, but why thumbs down.\nThis also reveals the interesting aspect here, namely that the WOWCube never was designed by the Rubiks Cube company for Rubiks Cube users, but rather its the Cubios Inc. company that created the WOWCube Entertainment System. The company that owns the Rubiks brand name, Spin Master, has decided to make this $299 version of with official Rubiks Cube branding. Basically, you could have bought your own WOWCube all along for the past few years now.\nMore Of A MehCube\nConsidering the overwhelming chorus of crickets that greeted the release of earlier versions of the WOWCube Entertainment System, it seems unlikely that slapping Rubiks Cube branding on a WOWCube will do much to change the outcome. Although Cube enthusiasts dont mind shelling out a few hundred bucks for a magnetically levitated, fairy dust-lubricated Cube to gain that 0.1 second advantage in competitive solving, this is totally distinct from this WOWCube product.\nWhile absolutely impressive from a technological perspective, and likely a fun toy for (adult) children who can\u00a0 use it to keep themselves occupied with a range of potentially educational games, the price tag and potentially fragile nature of the device rather sours the deal. You do not want to give the WOWCube to a young child who may drop it harder than a $1,400 iPad, while giving Junior a dodgy $5 Rubiks Cube clone to develop their algorithmic skills with is far less of a concern.\nSo if Rubiks Cube fans dont seem interested in this device, and the average person might be interested, but only if it was less than $100, it would seem that the WOWCube is condemned to be just another overpriced gadget, and not some kind of digital re-imagining of the veritable Cube, as much as the marketing makes you want to sign up for a\u00a0WOWClub subscription and obligatory AI features."}

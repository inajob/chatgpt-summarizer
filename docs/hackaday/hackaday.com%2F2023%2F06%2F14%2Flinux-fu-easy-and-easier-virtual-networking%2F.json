However, some ways are easier than others. Take, for example, virtual networking. There are plenty of ways to make a bunch of Internet-connected computers appear to be on a single private network. Thats nothing new, of course. Linux and Unix have robust networking stacks. Since 2018, though, Wireguard has been the go-to solution; it has a modern architecture, secure cryptography, and good performance.\nTheres only one problem: it is relatively difficult to set up. Not impossible, of course. But it is a bit difficult, depending on what you want to accomplish.\nHow Difficult?\nYou must set up a wireguard server and one or more clients. Youll need to pick a range of IP addresses. You might need to turn on routing. You have to generate keys. You might need to configure DNS and other routing options. Youll certainly need to modify firewall rules. Youll also need to distribute keys.\nNone of these steps are terribly difficult, but it is a lot to keep straight. The wg program and wg-quick script do most of the work, but you have a lot of decisions and configuration management to keep straight.\nBrowse the official quick start, and youll see that it isnt all that quick. The wg-quick script is better but only handles some use cases. If you want really limited use cases, there are third-party tools to do a lot of the rote work, but if you need to change anything, youll still need to figure it all out.\nThat being said, once you have it set up, it pretty much works without issue and works well. But that initial setup can be very frustrating.\nAn Alternative\nThen theres Tailscale. This is, actually, a commercial service, although it has a free tier that is adequate for most personal use, and it is  in fact  based on wireguard. To join a Tailscale network, you just log into their web interface.\nTailscale provides NAT traversal. If NAT traversal fails, Tailscale relays encrypted traffic, although this, of course, increases latency. The service also provides magic DNS and some basic access controls. Paid plans get more access controls.\nGiven that it uses wireguard underneath, the security is similar. Tailscale has a fair comparison of using their service over going direct on their site. Obviously, a properly-configured wireguard configuration will outperform Tailscale. But the ease of use might be worth a little hit on performance for some people. They also have a list of how to set up wireguard or Tailscale. Of course, the list is shorter for Tailscale, but thats fair.\nThe only thing that might be a little unfair is that they compare themselves to setting up wireguard directly. However, if you have a common use case, the wg-quick or similar tools might be just as easy. It is up to you to decide if you need the features provided by full-blown wireguard, a wireguard helper, or something like Tailscale. There are also GUI or Web frontends for wireguard that might appeal to you if you like that sort of thing.\nPersonal\nOf course, anything with a free tier has to worry you simply because it might not be free tomorrow. However, for now, the free plan is great for many personal users. You get three users and up to 100 devices. You get some access controls and magic DNS.\nThere is client software for Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Synology. That means most of your devices are covered. Theres even a specific configuration for the Raspberry Pi.\nIn General\nWhether you use OpenVPN, wireguard, Tailscale, or other options, it is handy to have your private network distributed anywhere you have an Internet connection. Sure, you can open ports to the network, but thats complicated to manage, too. You can use random port numbers and hope all your software servers dont have any security flaws. Or you can trust a single VPN port. While you could argue the difference between having your eggs in one basket versus many, the VPN route is easier to manage and offers well-tested security.\nOnce you are on the private network, you dont need to worry about open firewalls or NAT translation for each service on your network. Print to printers, find your shared files, and use X11 or even telnet without exposing anything meaningful to the public network. It is worth setting up something.\nMany people dont like accessing the mobile Internet without a VPN. For simple cases, though, you can VPN through ssh.", "title": "Linux\u3068Wireguard\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4eee\u60f3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Linux\u306eWireguard\u3067\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306f\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u4e00\u90e8\u3084\u3084\u56f0\u96e3\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Tailscale\u304cWireguard\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u4ee3\u66ff\u624b\u6bb5\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002Tailscale\u306fNAT\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u6a5f\u80fd\u3001\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30afDNS\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u5236\u5fa1\u7b49\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u7121\u6599\u7248\u3067\u30823\u4eba\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u6700\u5927100\u53f0\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306eVPN\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u3042\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306a\u3089\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u4fdd\u305f\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Linux\u3068Wireguard\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4eee\u60f3\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Wireguard\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6848\u3068\u3057\u3066\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305fTailscale\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Tailscale\u306e\u5229\u70b9\uff1awireguard\u3088\u308a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068GUI\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9", "Tailscale\u306e\u7121\u6599\u7248\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u306bVPN\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7406\u7531"]}

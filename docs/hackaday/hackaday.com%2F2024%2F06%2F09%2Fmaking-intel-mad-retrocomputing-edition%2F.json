And if you think youre free of them because you have an AMD chip, thats just Intels instruction set with a different badge on the silicon. At least AMD licenses it, though  in the 80s there was another game in town that didnt exactly ask for permission before implementing, and improving upon, the Intel chips available at the time.\nThe NEC V20 CPU was a chip that was a drop-in replacement for the Intel 8088 and made some performance improvements to it as well. Even though the 186 and 286 were available at the time of its release, this was an era before planned obsolescence as a business model was king so there were plenty of 8088 systems still working and relevant that could take advantage of this upgrade. In fact, the V20 was able to implement some of the improved instructions from these more modern chips. And this wasnt an expensive upgrade either, with kits starting around $16 at the time which is about $50 today, adjusting for inflation.\nThis deep dive into the V20 isnt limited to a history lesson and technological discussion, though. Theres also a project based on Arduino which makes use of the 8088 with some upgrades to support the NEC V20 and a test suite for a V20 emulator as well.\nIf you had an original IBM with one of these chips, though, things werent all smooth sailing for this straightforward upgrade at the time. A years-long legal battle ensued over the contents of the V20 microcode and whether or not it constituted copyright infringement. Intel was able to drag the process out long enough that by the time the lawsuit settled, the chips were relatively obsolete, leaving the NEC V20 to sit firmly in retrocomputing (and legal) history.", "title": "Intel\u3068NEC\uff1aPC\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u306e\u7af6\u4e89", "body": "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306bIBM\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u5316\u4ee5\u6765\u3001Intel\u306fPC\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001AMD\u306e\u5834\u5408\u3067\u3082Intels\u306e\u547d\u4ee4\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002NEC V20 CPU\u306fIntel\u306e8088\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3082\u679c\u305f\u3057\u305f\u3002V20\u306f\u30018088\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Intel\u3068NEC\uff1aPC\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u306e\u7af6\u4e89", "NEC V20\uff1aIntel 8088\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1aNEC V20\u3078\u306e\u611b", "Arduino\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aNEC V20\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "\u6cd5\u5ef7\u306e\u6226\u3044\uff1aIntel\u3068NEC\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u88c1\u5224"]}

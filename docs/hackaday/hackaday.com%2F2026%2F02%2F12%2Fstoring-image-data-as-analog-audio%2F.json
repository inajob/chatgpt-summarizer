Its a niche mode that isnt as popular as modern digital modes like FT8, but it still has its proponents. SSTV isnt only confined to the radio, though. [BLANCHARD Jordan] used this encoding method to store digital images on a cassette tape in a custom-built tape deck for future playback and viewing.\nThe self-contained device first uses an ESP32 and its associated camera module to take a picture, with a screen that shows the current view of the camera as the picture is being taken. In this way its fairly similar to any semi-modern digital camera. From there, though, it starts to diverge from a typical digital camera. The digital image is converted first to analog and then stored as audio on a standard cassette tape, which is included in the module in lieu of something like an SD card.\nTo view the saved images, the tape is played back and the audio signal captured by an RP2040. It employs a number of methods to ensure that the reconstructed image is faithful to the original, but the final image displays the classic SSTV look that these images tend to have as a result of the analog media. As a bonus feature, the camera can use a serial connection to another computer to offload this final processing step.\nWeve been seeing a number of digital-to-analog projects lately, and whether thats as a result of nostalgia for the 80s and 90s, as pushback against an increasingly invasive digital world, or simply an ongoing trend in the maker space, were here for it. Some of our favorites are this tape deck that streams from a Bluetooth source, applying that classic cassette sound, and this musical instrument which uses a cassette tape to generate all of its sounds.", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u4fdd\u5b58\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u306eSSTV\u6280\u8853\u3067\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u4fdd\u5b58\u6cd5", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30b8\u30ab\u30e1\u88fd\u4f5c", "SSTV\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u753b\u50cf\u4fdd\u5b58\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u6614\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u753b\u50cf", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3078\u306e\u9006\u8ee2\uff1aDIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6f6e\u6d41"]}

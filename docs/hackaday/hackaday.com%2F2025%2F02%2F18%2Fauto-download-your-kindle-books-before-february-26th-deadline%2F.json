The most up-to-date project for automating this process appears to be Amazon Kindle Bulk Downloader.\nAs the company that famously removed 1984 from thousands of devices without users permission, this is a move that shouldnt be surprising, but is still disappointing, especially for those of us that were somewhat early adopters of ebooks with Kindles that dont have a WiFi connection. (Yes, you can tell us about how you bought a Sony reader before the Kindle even came out in the comments.)\nThe Typescript-coded tool runs inside bun which can be installed in any of the big three OSes and even has a handy Docker image if thats more your speed. Whether you use this tool or not, if you have any Kindle books wed implore you to download them now.\nOnce youve downloaded those books, how about cracking the DRM either with LEGO or with software like Calibre. You could load it on a completely Open Source Reader then."}

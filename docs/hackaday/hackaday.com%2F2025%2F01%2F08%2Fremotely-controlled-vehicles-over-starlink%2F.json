What if you want to control a vehicle thats 100s of kilometers away, or even on the other side of the planet? Cellular is an option, but is obviously limited by available infrastructure  good luck getting a cell signal in the middle of the ocean.\nBut what if you could beam your commands down from space? Thats what [Thingify] was looking to test when they put together an experimental RC boat using a Starlink Mini for communications. Physically, there was no question it would work on the boat. After all, it was small, light, and power-efficient enough. But would the network connection be up to the task of controlling the vehicle in real-time?\n\nDuring early ground testing, the Mini version of the Starlink receiver worked very well. Despite being roughly 1/4 the size of its predecessor, the smaller unit met or exceeded its performance during benchmarks on bandwidth, latency, and signal strength. As expected, it also drew far less power: the Minis power consumption peaked at around 33 watts, compared to the monstrous 180 W for the larger receiver.\nOn the water, there was even more good news. The bandwidth was more than enough to run a high-resolution video feedback to the command center. At the same time, the boat moved autonomously between waypoints, and when [Thingify] switched over to manual control, the latency was low enough not to be a problem. We wouldnt recommend manually piloting a high-speed aircraft over Starlink, but for a boat thats cruising along at 4 km/h, the lag didnt even come into play.\nThe downside? Starlink is a fairly expensive proposition; youd need to have a pretty specific mission in mind to justify the cost. The Mini receiver currently costs $599 USD (though it occasionally goes on sale), and youll need at least a $50 per month plan to go with it. While this puts it out of the price range for recreational RC, [Thingify] notes that its not a bad deal if youre looking to explore uncharted territory.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6307\u4ee4\u9001\u4fe1\uff1aStarlink\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fRC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "Starlink\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u6210\u529f\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u512a\u308c\u3001\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u6620\u50cf\u3082\u9001\u4fe1\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u9ad8\u3081\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6307\u4ee4\u9001\u4fe1\uff1aStarlink\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fRC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u9ad8\u6027\u80fdStarlink Mini\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9060\u8ddd\u96e2RC\u5236\u5fa1", "- \u6c34\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u81ea\u5f8b\u822a\u884c\uff1aStarlink\u3067\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u6210\u529f", "- \u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u6620\u50cf\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u578bRC\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1aStarlink\u5229\u7528\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30c7\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8"]}

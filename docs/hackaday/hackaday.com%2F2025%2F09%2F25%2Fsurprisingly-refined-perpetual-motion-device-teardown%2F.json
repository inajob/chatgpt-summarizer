A cool part about the device is that it comes with a completely clear enclosure, so you can admire its internals while its operating. Less cool was that after unboxing the device wasnt working as the detector wasnt getting the 12 V it needs to operate, requiring a bit of repairing first.\nThe crucial part of the perpetual motion device schematic with the sensor, MCU and coil. (Credit: bigclivedotcom, YouTube)\nBased on the label on the bottom of the device with the creative model identifier P-toy-002, its standby current is 10 \u00b5A which ramps up to 3 A when its operating. This makes sense when you look at the two core components: the industrial inductive detector, and a rather big electromagnet thats driven by a bank of three 10 mF, 35V capacitors, turning it into something akin to a coilgun. Annoyingly, an attempt was made to erase most of the IC package markings.\nThe circuitry isnt too complex, fortunately, with an adjustable electromagnet coil voltage circuit combined with a MOSFET to provide the pulse, and a 78L12 regulator to generate the 12 VDC from the coils voltage rail for the sensor that is monitored by a MCU.\n\n"}

A cool part about the device is that it comes with a completely clear enclosure, so you can admire its internals while its operating. Less cool was that after unboxing the device wasnt working as the detector wasnt getting the 12 V it needs to operate, requiring a bit of repairing first.\nThe crucial part of the perpetual motion device schematic with the sensor, MCU and coil. (Credit: bigclivedotcom, YouTube)\nBased on the label on the bottom of the device with the creative model identifier P-toy-002, its standby current is 10 \u00b5A which ramps up to 3 A when its operating. This makes sense when you look at the two core components: the industrial inductive detector, and a rather big electromagnet thats driven by a bank of three 10 mF, 35V capacitors, turning it into something akin to a coilgun. Annoyingly, an attempt was made to erase most of the IC package markings.\nThe circuitry isnt too complex, fortunately, with an adjustable electromagnet coil voltage circuit combined with a MOSFET to provide the pulse, and a 78L12 regulator to generate the 12 VDC from the coils voltage rail for the sensor that is monitored by a MCU.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u6c38\u4e45\u6a5f\u95a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u5b9f\u969b\u300d", "body": "\u6c38\u9060\u904b\u52d5\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3001\u7121\u63a5\u89e6\u8a98\u5c0e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u78c1\u77f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u521d\u671f\u4e0d\u826f\u304c\u3042\u308a\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u6c38\u4e45\u6a5f\u95a2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u5b9f\u969b\u300d", "\u300c\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01P-toy-002\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u8a98\u5c0e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u78c1\u77f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u89e3\u6790\uff1aP-toy-002\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u52d5\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u6c38\u4e45\u6a5f\u95a2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u300d"]}

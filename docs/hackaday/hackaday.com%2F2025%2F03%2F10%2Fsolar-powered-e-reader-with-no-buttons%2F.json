A device custom-built to your own specifications is always going to provide a more satisfying experience than something purchased off the shelf. Thats why [fel88] put together this custom e-reader which offers a number of unique features, such as a solar panel on the back and button-free operation.\nOne issue with modern e-readers, at least as [fel88] sees it, is that they have a lot of unnecessary features. This project removes most of them, stripping down the device to its core functionality: a straightforward menu for selecting books and gesture-sensing for navigating the menu as well as changing the pages. The only physical input on the device is a small reed switch to turn the device on. A 3D printed case holds the e-ink display and encloses the inner workings, driven by an Arduino Mega 2560 and powered by three lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) and a small solar panel.\nBy dropping all of the unnecessary features, the device doesnt need to waste energy with things like WiFi or Bluetooth and can get around 880 pages on a single charge, not counting any extra energy coming in through the solar panel while its operating. The LICs will also theoretically improve its life cycle as well. If youre still stuck with a paperweight when you formerly had a working e-reader, though, there are plenty of ways to bring old devices back to life as well."}

Most of them end up attaching a gearbox to an off-the-shelf brushless motor and call it a day. Not everyone goes that way, though, which is why this internal cycloidal drive actuator caught our eye.\nTaking design cues from the MIT Mini Cheetah, [Aaed Musa] approached his actuator from the inside out, literally. His 3D printed cycloidal gearbox is designed to fit inside the stator of a BLDC motor. And not just any BLDC motor, but one built mostly from scratch using a hand-wound  and unwound, and wound again  stator along with a rotor that started as a printed part but was eventually machined from steel. Apart from its fixed ring, the cycloidal drive was mostly 3D printed, with everything fitting nicely inside the stator.\nThe video below shows the design and assembly process as well as testing of the finished drive. It seems to do really well with speed and positional accuracy, and it delivers a substantial amount of torque. Maybe a little too much, though; testing it with a heavy weight on the end of an arm got the stator coils hot enough to warp the printed parts within. But no matter; this was only a prototype after all. [Aaed] says improvements are in the works, including replacing all the plastic parts with metal ones.\nNeed a little background on cycloidal drives? Theyre pretty cool.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u306b\u5185\u90e8\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u99c6\u52d5\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u306b\u3064\u3089\u308c\u3066DIY\u7248\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30a2\u30af\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u7279\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3067\u3059\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u304cBLDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u306f\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3001\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8abf\u5b50\u304c\u826f\u3055\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u91cd\u3044\u91cd\u308a\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3068\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u5909\u5f62\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306a\u306e\u3067\u6539\u826f\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n(Note: The summary is a rough translation and may not be perfect)", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u306b\u5185\u90e8\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u99c6\u52d5\u304c\u767b\u5834", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30ae\u30a2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092BLDC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5185\u8535", "MIT Mini Cheetah\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u3092\u767a\u751f\u3055\u305b\u308b", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u304b\u3089\u91d1\u5c5e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3078\u306e\u6539\u826f\u3092\u8a08\u753b"]}

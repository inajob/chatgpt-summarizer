For todays fix of beautiful LED devices, take a look at the two L\u00c4MP creations of [Jana Marie], both LED projects building upon one another. Its not just your regular RGB LEDs  she adds a healthy mix of white and yellow LEDs, making for colors way more natural-looking and pleasant to the eye!\nThe first one is the LAEMP-Panel, a two-PCB sandwich, combining into a spot light you can use for any purpose where some extra LED would really shine  be it photography, accent, or mood lighting. All of these LEDs are individually controlled and from the SK6812 family, half of them YYW and half RGB variation. As for the base board, the controller is an ESP32, paired to an E75 ZigBee module  this spot light is built to be part of your homes ZigBee network. If you look at the base boards KiCad files, you will also notice six-pin headers on five edges  and theyre there for a reason.\nThe sister project to this one, the LAEMP-Prism, is a remarkable hexagonal lamp built upon the LAEMP-Panels PCB base, but in a desk-friendly form-factor. Six extra side panels with a generous amount of circular cutouts give you a total of 291 LEDs, mix of yellow, white and RGB as before  we got to say, from the pictures we found, it looks like a gorgeous thing to have in your house!\nSuch is a story of building a spotlight and a desk lamp, both using the same hardware base to accomplish quite different purposes. As is [Jana-Marie]s tradition, these two lamps are fully open-source, complete with instructions on assembling them  everything is ready for you if youd like to build one of your own, whichever version it may be! When it comes to lamp-building projects that excel at looks, one cant forget the two other lamps weve seen a few years ago  one built with fiber optics, and another in the shape of the Moon."}

The core of the machine is [Ben Eaters] breadboard 6502 design. To make it a VIC-20, though, you need a VIC chip which, of course, is no longer readily available. Many people, of course, use FPGAs or other programmable logic to fake VIC chips. But [Matt] will build his with discrete TTL logic. You can see the first installment of the series below.\n\nAlthough the base machine is sort of a copy of [Bens] breadboard, [Matt] has a few different building techniques that are worth learning and also made some changes to the clock input. This could be useful when troubleshooting, which was necessary when the breadboard didnt start up at first.\nWhile the first CPU was on a breadboard, the fake VIC will be on perf board. The new VIC impostor will also output modern VGA signals.\nThe VIC-20 is a very popular computer to clone. We also see a lot of  sometimes incredible  restorations.\n"}

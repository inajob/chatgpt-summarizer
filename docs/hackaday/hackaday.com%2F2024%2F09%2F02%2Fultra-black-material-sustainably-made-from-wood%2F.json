The deep, dark black is not the result of any sort of dye or surface coating; its structural change to the wood itself that causes it to swallow up at least 99% of incoming light.\nOne of a number of prototypes for watch faces and jewelry.\nThe discovery was partially accidental, as researchers happened upon it while looking at using high-energy plasma etching to machine the surface of wood in order to improve its water resistance. In the process of doing so, they discovered that with the right process applied to the right thickness and orientation of wood grain, the plasma treatment resulted in a surprisingly dark end result. Fresh from the plasma chamber, a wood sample has a thin coating of white powder that, once removed, reveals an ultra-black surface.\nThe resulting material has been dubbed Nxylon (the name comes from mashing together Nyx, the Greek goddess of darkness, with xylon the Greek word for wood) and has been prototyped into watch faces and jewelry. Its made from natural materials, the treatment doesnt create or involve nasty waste, and its an economical process. For more information, check out UBCs press release.\nYou have probably heard about Vantablack (and how you cant buy any) and artist Stuart Semples ongoing efforts at making ever-darker and accessible black paint. Blacker than black has applications in optical instruments and is a compelling thing in the art world. Its also very unusual to see an ultra-black anything that isnt the result of a pigment or surface coating."}

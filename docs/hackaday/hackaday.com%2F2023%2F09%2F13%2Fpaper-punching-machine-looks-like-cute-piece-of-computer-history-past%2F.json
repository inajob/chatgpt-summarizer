Great stacks of cards would run middling programs, with data output onto more punched cards in turn. [Nii] has built a machine in this vein, capable of punching binary into paper tape.\u00a0\nThe machine is run by a stepper motor, which is charged with feeding the paper tape through the machine in steady steps. A series of vertically-actuated solenoids punch holes in the paper tape as directed. The machine buzzes and clicks away like the best electromechanical computing devices of the mid-century era.\nTo what end, we couldnt possibly say. One user noted the machine was punching seemingly random binary into the paper tape, and [Nii] has not provided any explanation as to the machines higher purpose. Regardless, whatever it is doing, it looks like its doing it well. Feel free to speculate in the comments.\nImpressively, the petite device will be demonstrated at MF-TOKYO, the 7th Annual Metal Forming Fair in Tokyo this year. Were sure the clickity-clack will be muchly appreciated in person.\u00a0 Video after the break.\n\n\n\u3046\u304a\u3049\u304a\uff01\u52d5\u3044\u305f\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u3000#\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc pic.twitter.com/pUcB1hDId3\n Nii (@neet2121) September 10, 2023\n", "title": "\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5fa9\u53e4\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u3092\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7d19\u3092\u9001\u308a\u3001\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3067\u7a74\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u3002\u305d\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3060\u304c\u3001MF-TOKYO\u3067\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5fa9\u53e4\u6280\u8853", "\u4e2d\u4e16\u7d00\u98a8\u306e\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\uff1a\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u3000\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "MF-TOKYO\u3067\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff01\u3000\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u97f3\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u7684", "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u3092\u751f\u6210\uff01\u3000\u8b0e\u306e\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u3078"]}

Thats where they live on in the collective memory. But a Z80, a 6502, or similar was more likely to be found unseen in a piece of industrial machinery, doing the job for which wed today reach for a microcontroller. Sometimes these two worlds intersected, and thus we come to the EuroBEEB, a derivative of Acorns BBC Micro on a Eurocard. [Steve Crozier] has performed extensive research into this system and even produced a recreated PCB, providing a fascinating window into embedded computing in the early 1980s.\nThe EuroBEEB was the work of Control Universal, a Cambridge-based company specialising in embedded computers. They produced systems based upon 6502 and 6809 processors, and joining their product line to the then-burgeoning BBC Micro ecosystem would have been an obvious step. The machine itself is a Eurocard with a simple 6502 system shipped with ACORN BBC Basic on ROM, and could be seen as a cut-down BBC Micro with plenty of digital I/O, accesible through a serial port. It didnt stop there though, as not only could it export its graphics to a real BBC Micro, it had a range of expansion Eurocards that could carry the missing hardware such as analogue input, Teletext, or high-res graphics.\nThe reverse-engineered PCB comes from analysis of surviving schematics, and included a couple of gate array logic chips to replace address decoding ROMs in the original. If it seems overkill for anyone used to a modern microcontroller, its worth remembering that by the standards of the time this was a pretty simple system. Meanwhile if you only fancy trying BBC BASIC, theres no need to find original hardware.", "title": "8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1aEuroBEEB\u306e\u9b45\u529b  ", "body": "8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306eEuroBEEB\u306f\u3001\u7523\u696d\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u3001BBC Micro\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1aEuroBEEB\u306e\u9b45\u529b  ", "EuroBEEB\uff1aAcorn BBC Micro\u306e\u9032\u5316  ", "\u7523\u696d\u6a5f\u68b0\u306b\u6f5c\u30808\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4e16\u754c  ", "BBC BASIC\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1aEuroBEEB\u306e\u57fa\u76e4\uff08PCB\uff09\u88fd\u4f5c  ", "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3078\u306e\u65c5"]}

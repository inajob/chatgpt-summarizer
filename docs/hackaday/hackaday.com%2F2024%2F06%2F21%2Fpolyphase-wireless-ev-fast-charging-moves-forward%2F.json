Researchers from Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) and VW have moved high-speed wireless EV charging one step closer to reality.\nWeve seen fast wireless EV chargers before, but what sets this system apart is the coil size (~0.2 m2 vs 2.0 m2) and the fact it was demonstrated on a functioning EV where previous attempts have been on the bench. According to the researchers, this was the first wireless transfer to a light duty vehicle at 270 kW. Industry standards currently only cover systems up to 20 kW.\nThe system uses a pair of polyphase electromagnetic coupling coils about 50 cm (19) wide to transfer the power over a gap of approximately 13 cm (5). Efficiency is stated at 95%, and that 270 kW would get most EVs capable of those charge rates a 50% bump in charge over ten minutes (assuming youre in the lower part of your battery capacity where full speeds are available).\nWeve seen some in-road prototypes of wireless charging as well as some other interesting en route chargers like pantographs and slot car roads. Weve got you covered if youre wondering what the deal is with all those different plugs that EVs have too.\n\n"}

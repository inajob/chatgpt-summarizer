These include the time-walk effect: if your circuit compares the input with a set threshold, a stronger signal will cross the threshold faster than a weaker signal arriving at the same time, so stronger signals seem to arrive faster. A constant-fraction discriminator solves this by triggering at a constant fraction of the signal pulse, and [Michael Wiebusch] recently presented a hacker-friendly implementation of the design (open-access paper).\nA constant-fraction discriminator splits the input signal into two components, inverts one component and attenuates it, and delays the other component by a predetermined amount. The sum of these components always crosses zero at a fixed fraction of the original pulse. Instead of checking for a voltage threshold, the processing circuitry detects this zero-crossing. Unfortunately, these circuits tend to require very fast (read \u201cexpensive\u201d) operational amplifiers.\nThis is where [Michael]\u2019s design shines: it uses only a few cheap integrated circuits and transistors, some resistors and capacitors, a length of coaxial line as a delay, and absolutely no op-amps. This circuit has remarkable precision, with a timing standard deviation of 60 picoseconds. The only downside is that the circuit has to be designed to work with a particular signal pulse length, but the basic design should be widely adaptable for different pulses.\n[Michael] designed this circuit for a gamma-ray spectrometer, of which we\u2019ve seen a few examples before. In a spectrometer, the discriminator would process signals from photomultiplier tubes or scintillators, such as we\u2019ve covered before.", "title": "- \u9ad8\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u5230\u7740\u3092\u30d4\u30b3\u79d2\u5358\u4f4d\u3067\u8a08\u6e2c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9\u306e\u5230\u7740\u3092\u8d85\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3067\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9ad8\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u5230\u7740\u3092\u30d4\u30b3\u79d2\u5358\u4f4d\u3067\u8a08\u6e2c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5b9a\u6570\u6bd4\u8b58\u5225\u5668\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4fe1\u53f7\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u7d20\u5b50\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u691c\u51fa\u56de\u8def", "- \u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u5411\u3051\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u6642\u9593\u9045\u308c\u3068\u5f37\u5ea6\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853"]}

Beethovens bust wouldnt look quite right in front of your secret door if it was bright orange PLA, after all. [Denny] over at Shake the Future on YouTube is taking a break from metal casting to show off a quick-and-easy plaster casting method but dont worry, he still uses a microwave.\nMost people, when theyre casting something non-metallic from a 3D print are going to reach for castable silicone and create a mold, first. It works for chocolate just as easily as it does plaster, and it does work well. The problem is that its an extra step and extra materials, and who can afford the time and money that takes these days?\n[Denny]s proposal is simple: make the mold out of PLA. Hes using a resin slicer to get the negative shape for the mold, and exporting the STL to slice in PrusaSlicer, but Blender, Meshmixer and were pretty sure Cura should all work as well. [Denny] takes care when arranging his print to avoid needing supports inside the mold, but thats not strictly necessary as long as youre willing to clean them out. After that, its just a matter of mixing up the plaster, pouring it into the PLA, mold, and waiting.\nWaiting, but not too long. Rather than let the plaster fully set up, [Denny] only waits about an hour. The mold is still quite wet at this point, but thats a good thing. When [Denny] tosses it in his beloved microwave, the moisture remaining in the plaster gets everything hot, softening the PLA so it can be easily cut with scissors and peeled off.\nYeah, this technique is single-use as presented, which might be one advantage to silicone, if you need multiple copies of a cast. Reusing silicone molds is often doable with a little forethought. On the other hand, by removing the plaster half-cured, smoothing out layer lines becomes a simple matter of buffing with a wet rag, which is certainly an advantage to this technique.\nSome of you may be going well, duh, so check out [Denny]s cast-iron benchy if his plasterwork doesnt impress. Weve long been impressed with the microwave crucibles shown off on Shake the Future, but its great to have options. Maybe metal is the material, or perhaps plain plastic is perfect but if not, perchance Plaster of Paris can play a part in your play.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\uff1aPLA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6cd5", "body": "Denny\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u578b\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\uff1aPLA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6cd5", "- \u7c21\u5358\uff01PLA\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3067\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6d41\u3057\u8fbc\u3080\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5e45\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3067\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u4e7e\u71e5\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u8a66\u305b\u308b", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u4e00\u5ea6\u304d\u308a\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u5229\u70b9"]}

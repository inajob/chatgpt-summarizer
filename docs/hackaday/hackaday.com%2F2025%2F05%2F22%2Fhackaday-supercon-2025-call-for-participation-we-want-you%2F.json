So get to brainstorming, because we\u2019d like to hear what youve been up to! Like last year, we\u2019ll be featuring both longer and shorter talks, and hope to get a great mix of both first-time presenters and Hackaday luminaries. If you know someone you think should give a talk, point them here.\nThe Call for Participation form is online now, and you\u2019ve got until July 3rd to get yourself signed up.\nHonestly, just the people that Supercon brings together is reason enough to attend, but then you throw in the talks, the badge-hacking, the food, and the miscellaneous shenanigans \u2026 it\u2019s an event you really don\u2019t want to miss. And as always, presenters get in for free, get their moment in the sun, and get warm vibes from the Hackaday audience. Get yourself signed up now!\nWell have more news forthcoming in the next few weeks, including the start of ticket sales, so be sure to keep your eyes on Hackaday."}

[Engineezy] adds some color to the theme, building a machine to create 1616 marble images automatically. (Video embedded below.)\nThe core problem was devising ways to sort, lift, place, and dump marbles in their correct positions without losing their marbles\u2014figuratively and literally. Starting with color detection, [Engineezy] used an RGB color sensor and Euclidian math to determine each marbles color. After trying several different mechanical sorting mechanisms, he settled on a solenoid and servo-actuated dump tube to drop the marble into the appropriate hopper.\nAfter sorting, he faced challenges with designing a mechanism to transport marbles from the bottom hoppers to the top of the machine. While paddle wheels seemed promising at first, they tended to jam\u2014a problem solved by innovating with Archimedes screws that move marbles up smoothly without clogs. The marbles are pushed into clear tubes on either side of the machine, providing a clear view of their parade to the top.\nPerhaps most ingenious is his use of constant-force springs as a flexible funnel to guide the marbles to a moving slider that drops them into the correct column of the display. When a picture is complete, sliding doors open on the bottom of the columns, dumping the marbles into a chain lift which feeds them into the sorting section. Each of the mechanisms has a mirrored version of the other side, so the left and right halves of the display operate independently.\nThe final product is slow, satisfying and noisy kinetic testament to [Engineezy]s perseverance through countless iterations and hiccups.\nMarble machines can range from minimalist to ultra-complex musical monstrosities, but never fail to tickle our engineering minds.\n"}

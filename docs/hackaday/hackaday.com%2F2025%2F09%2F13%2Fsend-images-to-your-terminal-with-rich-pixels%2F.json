Give it an image, and itll dump it to your terminal in full color. While it also supports ASCII art, the cool part is how it makes it so easy to display an arbitrary image  a pixel-art rendition of it, anyway  in a terminal window.\nHow it does this is by cleverly representing two lines of pixels in the source image with a single terminal row of characters. Each vertical pixel pair is represented by a single Unicode \u2584 (U+2584 lower half block) character. The trick is to set the background color of the half-block to the upper pixels RGB value, and the foreground color of the half-block to the lower pixels RGB. By doing this, a single half block character represents two vertically-stacked pixels. The only gotcha is that Rich Pixels doesnt resize the source image; if ones source image is 600 pixels wide, ones terminal is going to receive 600 U+2584 characters per line to render the Rich Pixels version.\n[Simon WIllison] took things a step further and made show_image.py, which works the same except it resizes the source image to fit ones terminal first. This makes it much more flexible and intuitive.\nThe code is here on [Simon]s tools GitHub, a repository for software tools he finds useful, like the Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer.", "title": "- \u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u300cRich Pixels\u300d\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea", "body": "Rich Pixels\u306f\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u300cRich Pixels\u300d\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea", "- \u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u306b\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Unicode\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u306e\u88cf\u6280", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3057\u3066\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u300cshow_image.py\u300d", "- \u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4fbf\u5229\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

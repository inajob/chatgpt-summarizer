It was slow, it was bulky, but it was what you had, and that gave it a certain charm thats hard to resist. And that charm is what [Joshua Coleman] captures with this DIY paper tape reader build.\nIf the overall style of this project looks familiar, its because it was meant to echo the design themes from [Joshua]s Coleman Z-80 modular computer. The electronics of the reader are based on [David Hansel]s take on a paper tape reader, which in turn was meant to complement his Altair 8080 simulator  its retrocomputers all the way down! [Joshua]s build has a few bells and whistles to set it apart, though, including an adjustable read head, parametric 3D-printed reels, and a panel mounted ammeter, just because. He also set it up to be a sort of keyboard wedge thanks to an internal relay that bypasses the reader unless its actually playing back a tape. Playback speed is pretty fast; see the video below for details.\nSo far, writing the tapes is an offline process. [Joshua] uses a Python program to convert ASCII to an SVG file and uses a laser cutter to burn holes in lengths of paper, which are then connected together to form a longer tape. A logical next step might be to build a feeder that moves a paper tape across the bed of the laser cutter in sync with the conversion program, to create continuous paper tapes. Or, theres always the old-school route of solenoid-powered punch and die. Wed be thrilled with either.\n\n"}

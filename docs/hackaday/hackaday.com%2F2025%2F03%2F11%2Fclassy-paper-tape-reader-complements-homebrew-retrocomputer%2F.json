It was slow, it was bulky, but it was what you had, and that gave it a certain charm thats hard to resist. And that charm is what [Joshua Coleman] captures with this DIY paper tape reader build.\nIf the overall style of this project looks familiar, its because it was meant to echo the design themes from [Joshua]s Coleman Z-80 modular computer. The electronics of the reader are based on [David Hansel]s take on a paper tape reader, which in turn was meant to complement his Altair 8080 simulator  its retrocomputers all the way down! [Joshua]s build has a few bells and whistles to set it apart, though, including an adjustable read head, parametric 3D-printed reels, and a panel mounted ammeter, just because. He also set it up to be a sort of keyboard wedge thanks to an internal relay that bypasses the reader unless its actually playing back a tape. Playback speed is pretty fast; see the video below for details.\nSo far, writing the tapes is an offline process. [Joshua] uses a Python program to convert ASCII to an SVG file and uses a laser cutter to burn holes in lengths of paper, which are then connected together to form a longer tape. A logical next step might be to build a feeder that moves a paper tape across the bed of the laser cutter in sync with the conversion program, to create continuous paper tapes. Or, theres always the old-school route of solenoid-powered punch and die. Wed be thrilled with either.\n\n", "title": "- DIY\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Joshua Coleman\u304cDIY\u306e\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001ASCII\u3092\u7d19\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30de\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u66f8\u304d\u8fbc\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u63d0\u6848"]}

You can align the pattern pieces however you want, but theres going to be wasted everything  thread, fabric, and interfacing  whether you get it right the first time or not. Never mind the fact that people tend to create a muslin (prototype) first using inexpensive fabric (like muslin) for the purposes of getting the fit right.\nA few examples of the lines than can be created.\nThe MIT Self-Assembly Lab x Ministry of Supply have come up with a 4D garment construction technique that minimizes waste while being pretty darn cool at the same time. Theyve created a knit dress that combines several techniques and tools, including heat-activated yarns, computerized knitting, and 6-axis robotic activation. The result is a dress that can be permanently molded to fit the body however and wherever you want, using a heat gun mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm.\nAs far as we can tell, a finished dress does not come off of the machine in the short demo video after the break. It looks like it still has to be sewn together, which creates some potential for waste, but absolutely nothing like conventional methods.\nThis is probably the coolest dress weve seen since the one covered in LCD panels.\n\n", "title": "4D\u30ac\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "2D\u306e\u88c1\u7e2b\u306f\u7121\u99c4\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002MIT\u3068Ministry of Supply\u304c\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u74b0\u5883\u306b\u3084\u3055\u3057\u30444D\u670d\u4f5c\u308a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u71b1\u6d3b\u6027\u7cf8\u3084\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u4f53\u306b\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u6210\u5f62\u53ef\u80fd\u3002LCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u306b\u5339\u6575\u3059\u308b\u524d\u4f8b\u306e\u306a\u3044\u9032\u5316\u3002", "titles": ["4D\u30ac\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "MIT Self-Assembly Lab\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u71b1\u6d3b\u6027\u7cf8\u3068\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9", "\u30df\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u3068\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "LCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u306b\u7d9a\u304f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

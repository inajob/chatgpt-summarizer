Microsoft didnt want anyone running unsigned code, and darn if they didnt make it difficult to do so. However, some nifty out of the box thinking and tricky techniques cracked it open like a coconut with a crack in it. For the low down, [15432] has a great in-depth article on how it was achieved.\u00a0The article is in Russian, so youll want to be armed with Google Translate for this one.\nThe article gets right into the juice of how glitch attacks work\u2014in general, and with regards to the Xbox 360. In the specific case of the console, it was all down to the processors RESET line. Flicker it quickly enough, and the processor doesnt actually reset, but nonetheless its behavior changes. If you time the glitch right, you can get the processor to continue running through the bootloaders instructions even if a hash check instruction failed. Of course, timing it right was hard, so it helps to temporarily slow down the processor.\nFrom there, the article continues to explore the many and varied ways this hack played out against Microsofts copy protection across multiple models and revisions of the Xbox 360. The bit with the BGA ball connections is particularly inspired. [15432] also goes even deeper into a look at how the battle around the Xb0x 360s DVD-ROM drive got heated.\nWe seldom talk about the Xbox 360 these days, but they used to grace these pages on the regular. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to aliaali for the tip!]"}

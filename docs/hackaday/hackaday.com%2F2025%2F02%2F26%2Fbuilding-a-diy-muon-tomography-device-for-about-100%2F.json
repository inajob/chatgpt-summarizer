In lieu of spending a lot of spending a fair bit of money on dedicated muon detectors, you can also hack such a device together with two Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes and related circuitry for about $100 or whatever you can source the components for.\nThe reason for having two Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes is to filter out the countless other (much more prevalent) sources of ionizing radiation that were practically bathed in every second. Helped by a sheet of lead between both tubes, only a signal occurring at the same time from both tubes should be a muon. Specially cosmic ray muons, as these have significantly more kinetic energy that allows them to pass through both tubes. As a simple check its helpful to know that most of these muons will come from the direction of the sky.\nThe author of the article tested this cobbled-together detector in an old gold mine. Once there the presence of more rock (and fewer muons) was easily detected, as well as a surge in muons indicating a nearby void (a mine shaft). While not a fast or super-easy way to image structures, its hard to beat for the price and the hours of fun you can have while spelunking."}

In lieu of spending a lot of spending a fair bit of money on dedicated muon detectors, you can also hack such a device together with two Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes and related circuitry for about $100 or whatever you can source the components for.\nThe reason for having two Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes is to filter out the countless other (much more prevalent) sources of ionizing radiation that were practically bathed in every second. Helped by a sheet of lead between both tubes, only a signal occurring at the same time from both tubes should be a muon. Specially cosmic ray muons, as these have significantly more kinetic energy that allows them to pass through both tubes. As a simple check its helpful to know that most of these muons will come from the direction of the sky.\nThe author of the article tested this cobbled-together detector in an old gold mine. Once there the presence of more rock (and fewer muons) was easily detected, as well as a surge in muons indicating a nearby void (a mine shaft). While not a fast or super-easy way to image structures, its hard to beat for the price and the hours of fun you can have while spelunking.", "title": "\u5b87\u5b99\u7dda\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u790e", "body": "\u30b3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7c21\u6613\u5730\u8cea\u63a2\u67fb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b87\u5b99\u7dda\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u790e", "\u53e4\u3044\u91d1\u9271\u3067\u8a66\u3057\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u691c\u51fa\u5668", "\u30b8\u30ac\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u306eDIY", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u69cb\u6210\u3068\u52b9\u679c", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u30c8\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9"]}

In the real world, you might use a potentiometer or a pot to provide an adjustable value. However, as [Ralph] discovered, theres no pot component in LTSpice. At first, he cobbled up a fake pot with two resistors, one representing the top terminal to the wiper, and the other one representing the wiper to the bottom terminal. Check it out in the video below.\nAt first, [Ralph] just set values for the two halves manually, making sure not to set either resistor to zero so as not to merge the nets. However, as you might guess, you can make the values parameters and then step them.\u00a0\nBy using .step you can alter one of the resistor values. Then you can use a formula to compute the other resistor since the sum of the two resistors has to add up to the pots total value. That is, a 10K pot will have the two resistors always add up to 10K.\nOf course, you could do this without the .step and simply change one value to automatically compute both resistors if you prefer.\nWeve done our own tutorials with .step and parameters if you want a little more context. You can even use this idea to make your own custom pot component.\n", "title": "- LTSpice\u3067\u306e\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u56de\u8def\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u64ec\u4f3c\u7684\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- LTSpice\u3067\u306e\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u56de\u8def\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- LTSpice\u306e\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6280\u6cd5", "- .step\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\uff1a\u62b5\u6297\u5024\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

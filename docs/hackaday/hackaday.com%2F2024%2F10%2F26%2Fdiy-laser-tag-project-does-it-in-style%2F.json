Its all in Japanese and youll need to visit X (formerly Twitter) to see it, but the images do a fine job of getting the essentials across and your favorite translator tool will do a fair job of the rest.\nTheres a whole lot to admire in this project. The swing-out transparent OLED display is super slick, the electronics are housed on a single PCB, the back half of the grip is in fact a portable USB power bank that slots directly in to provide power, and theres a really smart use of a short RGB LED strip for effects.\nThe optical elements show some inspired design, as well. An infrared LED points forward, and with the help of a lens, focuses the beam tightly enough to make aiming meaningful. For detecting hits, the top of the pistol conceals a custom-made reflector that directs any IR downward into a receiver, making it omnidirectional in terms of hit sensing but only needing a single sensor.\nWant to know more? Check out [Nii]s earlier prototypes on his website. Its clear this has been in the works for a while, so if you like seeing how a project develops, youre in for a treat.\nAs for the choice of transparent OLED displays? They are certainly cool, and we remember how wild it looks to have several stacked together."}

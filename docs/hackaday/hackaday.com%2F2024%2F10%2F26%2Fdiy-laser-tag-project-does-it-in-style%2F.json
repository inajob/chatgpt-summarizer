Its all in Japanese and youll need to visit X (formerly Twitter) to see it, but the images do a fine job of getting the essentials across and your favorite translator tool will do a fair job of the rest.\nTheres a whole lot to admire in this project. The swing-out transparent OLED display is super slick, the electronics are housed on a single PCB, the back half of the grip is in fact a portable USB power bank that slots directly in to provide power, and theres a really smart use of a short RGB LED strip for effects.\nThe optical elements show some inspired design, as well. An infrared LED points forward, and with the help of a lens, focuses the beam tightly enough to make aiming meaningful. For detecting hits, the top of the pistol conceals a custom-made reflector that directs any IR downward into a receiver, making it omnidirectional in terms of hit sensing but only needing a single sensor.\nWant to know more? Check out [Nii]s earlier prototypes on his website. Its clear this has been in the works for a while, so if you like seeing how a project develops, youre in for a treat.\nAs for the choice of transparent OLED displays? They are certainly cool, and we remember how wild it looks to have several stacked together.", "title": "- \u900f\u660eOLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u6771\u4eac\u30e1\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305fDIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u900f\u660eOLED\u3084USB\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u900f\u660eOLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30ebPCB\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebUSB\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u8d64\u5916\u7ddaLED\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8ce2\u3044\u547d\u4e2d\u5224\u5b9a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- [Nii]\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306e\u904e\u7a0b"]}

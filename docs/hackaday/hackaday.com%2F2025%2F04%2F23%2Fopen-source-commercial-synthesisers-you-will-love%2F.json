They are commercial products which were launched on Kickstarter, and if youre in the market for such a thing you can buy one for yourself. Whats made them of interest to us here at Hackaday though is not their musical capabilities though, instead its that theyve honoured their commitment to release them as open source in the entirety.\nSo for your download, you get everything you need to build a pair of rather good 24-bit synthesisers based upon the STM32 family of microcontrollers. Were guessing that few of you will build your own when its an easier job to just buy one from Randomwaves, and were guessing that this open-sourcing will lead to interesting new features and extensions from the community of owners.\nIt will be interesting to watch how this progresses, because of course with the files out there, now anyone can produce and market a clone. Will AliExpress now be full of knock-off Drumboys and Synthgirls? Its a problem weve looked at in the past with respect to closed-source projects, and doubtless there will be enterprising electronics shops eyeing this one up. By our observation though it seems to be those projects with cheaper bills of materials which suffer the most from clones, so perhaps that higher-end choice of parts will work in their favour.\nEither way we look forward to more open-source from Randomwaves in the future, and if youd like to buy either instrument you can go to their website.\nThanks [Eil\u00eds] for the tip."}

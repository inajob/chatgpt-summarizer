We can almost smell the solder from here. If you\u2019re coming, and especially if it\u2019s your first time, you\u2019re soon to be faced with the eternal dilemma of hacker cons, only at Supercon it\u2019s maybe a trilemma or even a quadralemma: hang out with folks, work on the badge, go to talks, or show off all the cool stuff you\u2019ve been working on the past year?\nWhy not all four? That\u2019s exactly why we start off with a chill-out day on Friday, when we don\u2019t have much formally planned. Sure, there\u2019s a party Friday night, and maybe a badge talk or some workshops, but honestly you\u2019ll have most of the day free. Ease into it. Have a look at the badge and start brainstorming. Meet some new people and start up a team. Or just bathe in the tremendous geekery of it all. This is also a great time to show off a small project that you brought along. Having the widget that you poured brain, sweat, and tears into sitting on the table next to you is the perfect hacker icebreaker.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, there will definitely be talks that you\u2019ll want to attend, so scope that out ahead of time and plan those in. But don\u2019t feel like you have to go to all of them, either. Most of the talks will be online, either right away or eventually, so you won\u2019t miss out forever. But since our speakers are putting their own work out there, if you\u2019re interested in the subject, having questions or insight about their talk is a surefire way to strike up a good conversation later on, and that\u2019s something you can\u2019t do online. So plan in a few talks, too.\nYou\u2019ll find that the time flies by, but don\u2019t feel like you have to do it all either. Ask others what the coolest thing they\u2019ve seen is. Sample as much as you can, but it\u2019s not Pokemon \u2013 you can\u2019t catch it all.\nSee you in two weeks!\n(PS: The art is recycled from a Supercon long, long ago. I thought it was too nice to never see it again.)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

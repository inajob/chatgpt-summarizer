Shocking, we know, but that certainly seems to be what an outfit called Cox Media Group (CMG) does with its Active Listening software, according to a leaked slide deck that was used to pitch potential investors. The gist is that the software uses a smartphones microphone to listen to conversations and pick out keywords that it feeds to its partners, namely Google, Facebook, and Amazon so that they can target you with directed advertisements. Ever have an IRL conversation about something totally random only to start seeing references to that subject pop up where they never did before? We sure have, and while relationship mining seemed like a more parsimonious explanation back in 2017, the state of tech makes eavesdropping far more plausible today. Then theres the whole thing of basically being caught red-handed. The Big Three all huffed and puffed about how they were shocked, SHOCKED to learn that this was going on, with reactions ranging from outright denial of ever partnering with CMG to quietly severing their relationship with the company. So much for years of gaslighting on this.\n\nIn other dystopian news, the American Radio Relay League just wrote a $1 million check to end a ransomware attack. According to an ARRL statement, unidentified threat actors found their way into computer systems at the groups Newington, Connecticut headquarters and related cloud-based systems, which allowed them to install encryption packages on laptops, desktops, and servers running a variety of operating systems. The ARRLs crisis team managed to talk the cyberattackers down from their original demand of several million dollars to just a million, which all things considered was probably the path of least resistance and lowest cost. Its a shame that things have come to that, but here we are.\nThe long saga of Starliners first crewed test flight is finally over, as the beleaguered spacecraft pushed back from the International Space Station and headed back to a midnight landing in New Mexico on Saturday. The return was sans crew, of course, with NASA being unwilling to risk the lives of astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore in a spacecraft that hadnt really performed up to snuff on the way up to the ISS. As if the leaky thrusters werent enough, just before the hatches were closed Wilmore reported weird noises coming from a speaker in Starliner. He managed to capture the sounds on his mic for Mission Control, which for all the world sounded like someone repeatedly banging on a pipe in the distance. The weird thing about the sound is the regularity, which sounded a little faster than one per second. Were keen to see if NASA shares any in-depth engineering information on this and all the other Starliner anomalies now that the craft is back on the ground.\nIf youve ever had to do extensive overhead work, such as sanding or painting ceilings, or working under a car on a lift, you know the burn that starts to set in after just a short while of holding your arms over your head. Up to now, the only way to fix that was either hit the gym and work on upper body strength, or find another way to make a living. But now that were living in the future, you can just strap on your own exoskeleton backpack and take a load off the robotic way. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ExoActive exoskeleton comes from Festool, best known for its wonderfully well-engineered premium tools that often command a premium price. The ExoActive is battery-powered and straps on like a backpack with extensions that support the upper arms. It can be set to different work heights and provides a boost in lifting power, taking some of the weight off your shoulder girdle and transmitting it to your lower back. Unlike other exoskeletons weve seen breathless press releases for, this one seems like something you can buy right now. Sure, its expensive, but its a fraction of the cost of shoulder surgery.\n\nAnd finally, Animagraffs is back with an incredibly detailed look inside the inner workings of a 16th-century sailing vessel. The video really captures what it took to build vessels that could (just barely) sail around the world for the first time. We loved the explanation of the rigging, especially the differences between the standing rigging and the running rigging. If you dont know your clewline from your backstay, this Blender tour de force will set you straight.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u6d3e\u306b\u885d\u6483\uff1f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304c\u4f1a\u8a71\u3092\u76d7\u8074\uff1f", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304c\u4f1a\u8a71\u3092\u76d7\u8074\u3057\u3001Google\u3084Facebook\u306b\u9001\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046Active Listening\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u6d41\u51fa\u3002ARRL\u304c\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u653b\u6483\u3067100\u4e07\u30c9\u30eb\u652f\u6255\u3044\u3001Starliner\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3067\u7c73\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u306fISS\u304b\u3089\u7121\u4e8b\u5e30\u9084\u3001Festool\u306e\u30a8\u30af\u30bd\u30b9\u30b1\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u767b\u5834\u300216\u4e16\u7d00\u5e06\u8239\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u6d3e\u306b\u885d\u6483\uff1f\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304c\u4f1a\u8a71\u3092\u76d7\u8074\uff1f", "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u56e3\u4f53\u30011\u5104\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u653b\u6483\u306b", "\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u3001\u8b0e\u306e\u7570\u97f3\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u5e30\u9084", "\u30a8\u30af\u30bd\u30b9\u30b1\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u306e\u80a9\u3053\u308a\u89e3\u6d88\u6cd5\uff1f", "16\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u8239\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u8aac\u3001\u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30b9\u304c\u5236\u4f5c"]}

This shoulder-launched anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) is a true marvel of engineering that has shown its chops during recent world events. As a fire-and-forget type guided missile it is designed to use the internal IR tracker to maintain a constant lock on the target, using its guidance system to stay exactly on track.\nFGM-148 Javelin schematic overview. (Source: U.S. Army, FM 3-22.37)\nInitially designed in 1989 and introduced into service in 1996, it has all the ceramic-and-gold styling which one would expect from a military avionics package from the era. Tasked with processing the information from the IR sensor, and continuously adjusting the fins to keep it on course, the two sandwiched, 3 mm thick PCBs that form the main section of the guidance computer are complemented by what looks like a milled aluminium section which holds a sensor and a number of opamps, all retained within the carbon-fiber shell of the missile.\nIn the video [Michel] looks at the main components, finding datasheets for many commercially available parts, with the date codes on the parts confirming that its a late 80s to early 90s version, using presumably a TMS34010 as the main CPU on the DSP board for its additional graphics-related instructions. Even though current production FGM-148s are likely to use far more modern parts, this is a fun look at what was high-end military gear in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\nThanks to [Claus] for the tip.", "title": "\"FGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\"", "body": "FGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u5199\u771f\u3092\u898b\u3066\u300180\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u304b\u308990\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u8ecd\u7528\u88c5\u5099\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"FGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\"", "\"80\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u304b\u308990\u5e74\u4ee3\u524d\u534a\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30df\u30ea\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30ae\u30a2\uff1aFGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u89e3\u5256\"", "\"FGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\"", "\"\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u6280\u8853\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u308bFGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u89e3\u6790\"", "\"FGM-148 Javelin\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u8d77\u6e90\""]}

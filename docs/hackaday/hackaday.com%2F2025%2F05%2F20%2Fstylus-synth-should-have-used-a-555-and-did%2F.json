The humble 555 is a wonderful tool in the right hands. Thats why its wonderful to see this all-analog stylus synth project by EE student [DarcyJ] bringing the 555 out for the new generation.\nThe project is heavily inspired by the vintage stylophone, but has some neat tweaks. A capacitor bank means multiple octaves are available, and using a ladder of trim pots instead of fixed resistors makes every note tunable. [Darcy] of course included the vibrato function of the original, but no, he did not use a 555 for that, too. He used an RC oscillator. He put a trim pot on that, too, to control the depth of vibrato, which we dont recall seeing on the original stylophone.\nThe writeup is very high quality and could be recommended to anyone just getting started in analog (or analogue) electronics not only does [Darcy] explain his design process, he also shows his pratfalls and mistakes, like in the various revisions he went through before discovering the push-pull amplifier that ultimately powers the speaker.\nSince each circuit is separately laid out and indicated on the PCB [Darcy] designed in KiCad for this project. Between that and everything being thru-hole, it seems like [Darcy] has the makings of a lovely training kit. If youre interested in rolling your own, the files are on GitHub under a CERN-OHL-S v2 license, \u00a0and dont forget to check out the demo video embedded below to hear it in action.\nOf course, making music on the 555 is hardly a new hack. Weve seen everything from accordions to paper-tape player pianos to squonkboxes over the years. Got another use for the 555? Let us know about it, in the inevitable shill for our tip line you all knew was coming.\n\n", "title": "- 555\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "555\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 555\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f\uff1a\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb", "- KiCad\u3067\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- 555\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u5b9f\u8df5\u4f8b"]}

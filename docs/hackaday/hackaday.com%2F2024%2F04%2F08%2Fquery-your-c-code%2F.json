Sure, you can use ctags and most other editors have some way of searching for things. But ClangQL from [AmrDeveloper] lets you treat your code base like a database.\nHonestly, weve often thought about writing something that parses C code and stuffs it into a SQL database. This tool leverages the CLang parser and lets you write queries like:\nSELECT * FROM functions\nThat may not seem like the best example, but how about:\nSELECT COUNT(name) FROM functions WHERE return_type=\"int\"\nThats a bit more interesting. The functions table provides each functions name, signature, a count of arguments, a return type, and a flag to indicate methods. We hope the system will grow to let you query on other things, too, like variables, templates, preprocessor defines, and data types. The tool can handle C or C++ and could probably work with other CLang front ends with a little work.\n\nThis would be great for estimating the difficulty of tasks. Imagine asking for how many functions return a float when trying to decide how long it would take to switch to fixed point. We plan to try it on a source tree for the Linux kernel and give it a spin.\nTruthfully, weve long been surprised databases havent taken over as file systems and source code anyway. A lot of what we do in git could be done in a database. And vice-versa."}

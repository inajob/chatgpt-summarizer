To calculate the f-number you divide the focal length by the diameter of the aperture. A common f-number is f/1.4 which is generally considered fast.\nWe are told the fastest commercial lens ever used had f/0.7 and was used by Stanley Kubrick to shoot the film Barry Lyndon which was recorded only with candle light.\nA microscope objective is a crucial lens that gathers and magnifies light to form an image. It plays a key role in determining the quality and clarity of the final magnified image produced by a microscope.\n\nIn this case the microscope objective is optically coupled to the CMOS image sensor using a drop of oil. The oil has better refractive properties than an air-gap. In order to get the closest coupling possible the protective glass sheet on the top of the image sensor was removed. This process resulted in a lot of broken image sensors! Apparently the yield was only two working image sensors from eight attempts at removing the glass.\nOf course weve seen f-number hacking here at Hackaday before, such as with the A Low F Number Lens, From Scratch which achieved f/0.5.\n"}

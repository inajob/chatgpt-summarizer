To calculate the f-number you divide the focal length by the diameter of the aperture. A common f-number is f/1.4 which is generally considered fast.\nWe are told the fastest commercial lens ever used had f/0.7 and was used by Stanley Kubrick to shoot the film Barry Lyndon which was recorded only with candle light.\nA microscope objective is a crucial lens that gathers and magnifies light to form an image. It plays a key role in determining the quality and clarity of the final magnified image produced by a microscope.\n\nIn this case the microscope objective is optically coupled to the CMOS image sensor using a drop of oil. The oil has better refractive properties than an air-gap. In order to get the closest coupling possible the protective glass sheet on the top of the image sensor was removed. This process resulted in a lot of broken image sensors! Apparently the yield was only two working image sensors from eight attempts at removing the glass.\nOf course weve seen f-number hacking here at Hackaday before, such as with the A Low F Number Lens, From Scratch which achieved f/0.5.\n", "title": "- \u6cb9\u6d78\u30df\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305ff/0.38\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u6cb9\u6d78\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u3044f/0.38\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6cb9\u6d78\u30df\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305ff/0.38\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u4f4e\u7167\u5ea6\u4e0b\u3067\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308bf\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305ff/0.7\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u79d8\u8a71", "- \u6cb9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fCMOS\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u7d50\u5408", "- \u5931\u6557\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff01\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u5236\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u7834\u640d\u306e\u5b9f\u60c5"]}

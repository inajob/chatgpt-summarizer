Tool-changing printers offer a way to do multi-material prints without the purge waste, but at the cost of complexity. Plastics cheap, though, so the logic has been that you could never save enough on materials cost to make up for the added capital cost of a tool-changer  that is, until now.\nCurrently active on Kickstarter, the Snapmaker U1 promises to change that equation. [Albert] got his hands on a pre-production prototype for a review on 247Printing, and what we see looks promising.\nThe printer features the ubiquitous 235 mm x 235 mm bed size  pretty much the standard for a printer these days, but quite a lot smaller than the bed of whats arguably the machines closest competition, the tool-changing Prusa XL. On the other hand, at under one thousand US dollars, its one quarter the price of Prusas top of the line offering. Compared to the XL, its faster in every operation, from heating the bed and nozzle to actual printing and even head swapping. That said, as youd expect from Prusa, the XL comes dialed-in for perfect prints in a way that Snapmaker doesnt manage  particularly for TPU. Youre also limited to four tool heads, compared to the five supported by the Prusa XL.\nThe U1 is also faster in multi-material than its price-equivalent competitors from Bambu Lab, up to two to three times shorter print times, depending on the print. Its worth noting that the actual print speed is comparable, but the Snapmaker takes the lead when you factor in all the time wasted purging and changing filaments.\nThe assisted spool loading on the sides of the machine uses RFID tags to automatically track the colour and material of Snapmaker filament. That feature seems to take a certain inspiration from the Bambu Labs Mini-AMS, but it is an area [Albert] identifies as needing particular attention from Snapmaker. In the beta configuration he got his hands on, it only loads filament about 50% of the time. One can only imagine the final production models will do better than that!\nIn spite of that, [Albert] says hes backing the Kickstarter. Given Snapmaker is an established company  we featured an earlier Snapmaker CNC/Printer/Laser combo machine back in 2021 thats less of a risk than it could be.\n\n", "title": "- Snapmaker U1\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "Snapmaker U1\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u30b9\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u591a\u7d20\u6750\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- Snapmaker U1\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u306a\u3057\u3067\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u524a\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc ", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u304b\u3064\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306aSnapmaker U1\u306e\u8a55\u4fa1 ", "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u81ea\u52d5\u8ffd\u8de1\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "- Kickstarter\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u306eSnapmaker U1\u3001\u652f\u63f4\u8005\u304c\u6025\u5897\u4e2d"]}

Most consumer units are designed to provide power during a black out only long enough to gracefully shut down your system. But with a few hacks like these, you can stretch that time out and turn it into a long-endurance UPS.\nAs many good stories do, this one starts in the trash, where [MetaphysicalEngineer] spotted an APC home office-style UPS. It was clearly labeled broken, but that just turned out to be a dead battery. While he could have simply replaced it with a 12-volt sealed lead-acid battery, [Meta] knew that his computer setup would quickly deplete the standard battery. A little testing showed him that a car battery would extend the run time significantly, especially if he threw in some extra cooling for the onboard inverter.\nHis final design uses a marine deep-cycle battery in a plastic battery box with the UPS mounted on top. The vacated battery compartment made a great place to add a cooling fan, along with a clever circuit to turn it on only when the beeper on the UPS sounds, with a bonus volume control for the annoying sound. He also added accessories to the battery box top, including a voltmeter, a USB charger, and a switched 12-volt power outlet. And kudos for the liberal use of fuses in the build; things could get spicy otherwise. The video below shows the entire build along with all the testing. [MetaphysicalEngineer] managed to triple the estimated runtime for the load hes trying to power, so it seems like a win to us.\nIf your needs run more toward keeping your networking gear running through a blackout, you might want to check out this inverter-less DC UPS.\n\n", "title": "\u9577\u6642\u9593\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30ab\u30fc\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6301\u7d9a\u578bUPS\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "UPS\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u3066\u3001\u9577\u6642\u9593\u306b\u308f\u305f\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30fc\u3084\u30de\u30ea\u30f3\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u51b7\u5374\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3084\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u3001USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u3001\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30923\u500d\u306b\u5ef6\u9577\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u9577\u6642\u9593\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30ab\u30fc\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6301\u7d9a\u578bUPS\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u8ffd\u52a0\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u4fdd\u6301\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u5ef6\u9577\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u8abf\u7bc0\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u8ff7\u60d1\u306a\u97f3\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u3067\u5b9f\u8a3c\uff01\u901a\u5e38\u306e3\u500d\u9577\u6642\u9593\u7a3c\u50cd\u3059\u308bUPS\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u7121\u505c\u96fb\u96fb\u6e90\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u983c\u3089\u305a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

OK, if were being honest with ourselves, there are a lot of things a Mac from 1986 cant do, but the rack space is what [identity4] was focused on when they built the 2025 Rackintosh Plus.\nSome folks may have been fooled by this ad to think this was an actual product.\nFor those of you already sharpening your pitchforks, worry not: [identity4]s beloved vintage Mac was not disassembled for this project. This rack mount has instead become the home for a spare logic board they had acquired Why? They wanted to use a classic Mac in their studio, and for any more equipment to fit the space, it needed to go into the existing racks. Its more practical than the motivation we see for a lot of hacks; its almost surprising it hasnt happened before. (Weve seen Mac Minis in racks, but not the classic hardware.)\nAside from the genuine Apple logic board, the thin rack also contains a BlueSCSI hard drive emulator, a Floppy Emu for SD-card floppy emulator, an RGB-to-HDMI converter to allow System 7 to shine on modern monitors, and of course a Mean Well power supply to keep everything running.The Floppy Emu required a little light surgery to move the screen so it would fit inside the low-profile rack. [identity4] also broke out the keyboard and mouse connectors to the front of the rack, but all other connectors stayed on the logic board at the rear.\nSound is handled by a single 8-ohm speaker that lives inside the rack mount, because even if the Rackintosh can now fit into a 1U space, it still cant do stereo soundor anything else a Macintosh Plus with 4 MB of RAM couldnt do. Still, its a lovely hack. and the vintage-style advertisement was an excellent touch.\nNow they just need the right monochrome display.", "title": "1U\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\uff01\u53e4\u5178\u7684Mac\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308bRackintosh Plus", "body": "1986\u5e74\u306eMacintosh Plus\u30921U\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u3002\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30afMac\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["1U\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\uff01\u53e4\u5178\u7684Mac\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308bRackintosh Plus", "2025\u5e74\u578bRackintosh Plus\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aMac\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u306b", "\u53e4\u3044Mac\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\uff01\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u5927\u80c6\u306b\u6539\u9020\uff01Rackintosh Plus\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "1U\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305fMac Plus\uff1a\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

Well, it\u2019s a simple video game that also has within it the ability to create all of the logic components that you\u2019d need to build a computer. And building CPUs in Minecraft is by now a long-standing tradition.\nEnter CHUNGUS II. The Computational Humongous Unconventional Number and Graphics Unit by [Sammyuri] is the biggest and baddest Minecraft computer that we\u2019ve ever seen. So big, in fact, that it was finally reasonable to think about porting a stripped-down version of Minecraft to the computer itself. Yes, that\u2019s right, Minecraft running in Minecraft. (Video embedded below.) Writing the compiler and programming the game brought two more hackers to the party, [Uwerta] and [StackDoubleFlow], and quite honestly, we\u2019re amazed that a team as small as three people pulled this off.\nAnyway, once you\u2019ve picked your jaw up off the floor, also check out [Sammyuri]\u2019s video on just the CHUNGUS II computer itself. (Also embedded below.) Seeing the architecture is interesting, even if you don\u2019t speak Redstone as fluently as our heroes here. We love that the assembler creates a block of ROM \u2013 out of Minecraft blocks \u2013 that you can then cut/paste into the game\u2019s reality.\nFor a \u201csimple\u201d game about breaking blocks and punching trees, Minecraft has inspired hackers to make the game better both inside and outside of the real world. For instance, for the latest in performant open-source Minecraft servers, check out Folia. Maybe, one day, theyll build CHUNGUS II in the real world. It could happen.\nThanks [dbcdr] for the tip!\n\n\n\n"}

Look closer next time\u2014many of them appear to hover just above the concrete, anchored by visible bolts. This video below explains it all. Its not a job left unfinished. It is actually clever design, and all about functionality and easy maintenance. Lets break down why engineers prefer this so-called floating base plate setup.\nAt first, you might think mounting poles directly into concrete would be more stable\u2014after all, that\u2019s how heavy columns are often installed. But traffic light poles are lightweight, hollow, and face constant wind pressure. Instead of brute stability, they need flexibility and precise alignment. Enter the standoff base plate. By resting on leveling nuts, these poles can be fine-tuned for perfect verticality, even when the ground shifts slightly over time. That\u2019s critical for keeping your 30-foot pole from leaning like the Tower of Pisa.\nThe open design also simplifies maintenance. If the pole tilts after years of wear, it takes just a few nut adjustments to fix it\u2014no heavy cranes required. Plus, the gap helps prevent moisture buildup, reducing corrosion. So next time youre waiting at an intersection, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s not just clever engineering\u2014it\u2019s practical street smarts. If youre an infrastructure nut, this slightly older article might spark your interest.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u898b\u308b\u300c\u6d6e\u904a\u57fa\u76e4\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u306e\u67f1\u306f\u6d6e\u904a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u98a8\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u67d4\u8edf\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u3082\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u898b\u308b\u300c\u6d6e\u904a\u57fa\u76e4\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u3042\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u7c21\u4fbf\u3055", "- \u5730\u9762\u306e\u5909\u5316\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u8abf\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044\uff01\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a5f\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u88cf\u5074"]}

The tube in question was an EABC80 or 6AK8 triple diode triode. The key was identifying a high-voltage FET and building it, along with some other components, into a tube base to make a plug-in replacement for the tube. You can see a video about the project below.\nThese tubes are often used as a detector and preamplifier. Removing the detector tube from a working radio, of course, kills the audio. Replacing the tube with a single diode restores the operation of the radio, although at a disadvantage.\nFrom there, he adds more diodes directly into the socket. Of course, diodes dont amplify, so he had to break out a LND150 MOSFET with a limit of 500 volts across the device. It takes some additional components, and the whole thing fits in a tube base ready for the socket.\nUsually, we see people go the other way using tubes instead of transistors in, say, a computer. If you want real hacking, why not make your own tubes?\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u611b\u597d\u8005\u304c\u3001\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u56fa\u4f53\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u3002EABC80\u307e\u305f\u306f6AK8\u4e09\u91cd\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727FET\u3092\u63a2\u3059\u4f5c\u696d\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u30d0\u30a4\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u5358\u4e00\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "\u300c\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727FET\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u8ffd\u52a0\u300d"]}

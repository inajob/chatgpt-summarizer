Sure. But there are a dedicated set that relish in mixing and matching parts and even building and assembling their own instruments. [Danny Lewis] decided to see what he could do with the cheapest guitar parts from Amazon and a body of his own design, and he put together something pretty passable for just $30.\nThe wood for the body was cut on a bandsaw, and was essentially free scrap sourced from old furniture. [Danny] went for an unconventional design using a roughly Telecaster outline and large cutouts either side of the bridge. The neck was free, by virtue of being an old Harmony neck sourced off Craigslist. Wed have preferred to see what could be done with a cheap Amazon neck, but it nonetheless fits the vibe of the build.\nThe guitar then received a $9.99 pickup and controls, an $8.80 solidtail bridge, and $11 tuning machines for the headstock. Strung up, it actually sounds passable. Wed want to throw it on a proper amp and give the whole thing a setup before fully assessing it, but hey, for $30, its hard to go wrong.\nWe do love some hacky guitars around here; weve even featured some with surprise effects gear built into the bodies. Video after the break.\n\n"}

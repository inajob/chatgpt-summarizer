However, modern technology has developed an alternative, in the form of a camera fitted inside a pill. [Aaron Christophel] recently came across one of these devices, and decided to investigate its functionality.\n[Aarons] first video involves a simple teardown of the camera. The small plastic pill is a marvel of miniaturization. Through the hemispherical transparent lens, we can see a tiny camera and LEDs to provide light in the depths of the human body. Slicing the camera open reveals the hardware inside, however, like the miniature battery, the microcontroller, and the radio hardware that transmits signals outside the body. Unsurprisingly, its difficult to get into, since its heavily sealed to ensure the human body doesnt accidentally digest the electronics inside.\nUnwilling to stop there, [Aaron] pushed onward\u2014with his second video focusing on reverse engineering. With a little glitching, he was able to dump the firmware from the TI CC1310 microcontroller. From there, he was able to get to the point where he could pull a shaky video feed transmitted from the camera itself. Artists are already making music videos on Ring doorbells; perhaps this is just the the next step.\nSmart pills were once the realm of science fiction, but theyre an increasingly common tool in modern medicine. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u5185\u8996\u93e1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5f62\u614b\uff1a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u642d\u8f09\u30d4\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "body": "\u5185\u8996\u93e1\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30d4\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002Aaron\u304c\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u3001\u5206\u89e3\u3084\u9006\u5de5\u5b66\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u767a\u898b\u3092\u5831\u544a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5185\u8996\u93e1\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5f62\u614b\uff1a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u642d\u8f09\u30d4\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\uff1a\u5185\u8996\u93e1\u7528\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5206\u89e3", "- \u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\uff01\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30d4\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u89e3\u6790", "- \u533b\u7642\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff1a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30eb\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u79d1\u5b66\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u73fe\u5b9f\u306b\uff1a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5185\u8535\u30d4\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

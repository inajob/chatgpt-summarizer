You hit them, and they vibrate. Its kind of fun. Piezoelectric elements can create electric current when they vibrate. [Will Dana] put two and two together to try and charge his phone on his YouTube channel WillsBuilds\u00a0embedded below.\nIt worked about as well as you might expect. Which is to say: not very well. The random piezo elements [Will] glues to his drum almost certainly arent optimized for this use case. Adding weight helps, but it doesnt look like a tuned system. Even if it was, piezoelectric generators arent terribly efficient by nature, and the (small) losses from the required bridge rectifiers arent helping. An energy-harvesting chip might have worked better, but it probably wouldnt have worked well.\nSince he cannot produce enough voltage in real time, [Will] opts to charge a capacitor bank that he can dump into the phone once it gets enough charge in it to register with the phones circuitry. It takes about 30 minutes drumming to charge the capacitors in parallel, before switching to series to get the voltage up to discharge. The capacitors drain in about a quarter second, probably to no measurable result but the phone does read as charging, which was the goal.\nDid it work? Technically, yes. The phone was charging. Is it practical? Certainly not. Is it a hack? Undeniably so.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u53e9\u3044\u3066\u5145\u96fb\uff01\u30d4\u30a8\u30be\u7d20\u5b50\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u53e9\u3044\u3066\u767a\u96fb\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3092\u5145\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002\u52b9\u679c\u8584\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u53e9\u3044\u3066\u5145\u96fb\uff01\u30d4\u30a8\u30be\u7d20\u5b50\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30d4\u30a8\u30be\u7d20\u5b50\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3092\u5145\u96fb\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- \u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3060\u3051\u3069\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u632f\u52d5\u3067\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u5f97\u308b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u8a66\u307f\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- \u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u30bc\u30ed\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3067\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

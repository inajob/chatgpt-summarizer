Show of hands: JavaScript? Go? Pascal? Well, there was at least one taker for that last one: [jns], and he has an hour-long tutorial video showing you how he made it happen.\u00a0\nThe site in question is the web store for his personal business, Photronic Arts, so you cannot say [jns] does not have skin in the game. From the front end, this is HTML and could be anything upto and including Shopify under the hood. Its not, though: its a wholly custom backend [jns] put together in FreePascal, using the Lazarus IDE.\nTheres a case to be made for Pascal in the modern day, but when we wrote that we werent expecting to get tips about web development.\u00a0 Ironically enough [jns] spends so much time giving the technical details in this video he doesnt delve that deeply into why he chose FreePascal, especially when its clear hes very familiar with C and C++. In his associated writeup on his Gopher page (link though Floodgap) [jns] simply declares its a language hes quite fond of, which is reason enough of us. The source code is available, though on request, to avoid AI scraping. Its a sad but understandable response to these modern times.\nIf youre not into web development and want to see a deep-dive into how the backend works, this video is worth watching even if you dont particularly care for Pascal. Its also worth watching if you do know backend development, and are Pascal-curious. If neither of those things interest you, what about this Pascal Library for Arduino?\nThanks to [jns] for the tip! If youre doing modern work with questionably-modern tools, we call that a hack and would love to hear from you.\n"}

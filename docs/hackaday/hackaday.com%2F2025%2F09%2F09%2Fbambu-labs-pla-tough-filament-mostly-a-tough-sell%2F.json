The most common additives here are primarily to add color, but other additives seek to specifically improve certain properties of PLA. For example Bambu Labs new PLA Tough+ filament series that [Dr. Igor Gaspar] over at the My Tech Fun YouTube channel had over for reviewing purposes.\nAccording to Bambu Labs claims for the filament, its supposed to have up to double the layer adhesion strength as their basic PLA, while being much more robust when it comes to flexing and taking a beating. Yet as [Igor] goes through his battery of tests  comparing PLA Tough+ against the basic PLA  the supposedly tough filament is significantly worse in every count. That sad streak lasts until the impact tests, which is where we see a curious set of results  as shown above  as well as [Igor]s new set of impact testing toys being put through their paces.\nOf note is that although the Tough+ variants tested are consistently less brittle than their basic PLA counterparts, the Silver basic PLA variant makes an unexpectedly impressive showing. This is a good example of how color additives can have very positive impacts on a basic polymer like PLA, as well as a good indication that at least Bambu Labs Basic PLA in its Silver variant is basically better than Tough+ filaments. Not only does it not require higher printing temperatures, it also doesnt produce more smelly VOCs, while being overall more robust.\n\n"}

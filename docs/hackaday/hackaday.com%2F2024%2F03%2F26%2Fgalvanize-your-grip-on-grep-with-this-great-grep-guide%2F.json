It might be a phone, an embedded device, or your TV. Either way, its running Linux, and somewhere along the line of the development of whatever your USB stick smacked into, somebody used the Global Regular Expression Print utility- better known as Grep. But what is Grep, and why do you need it? [Anton Zhiyanov] not only answers those questions but provides Grep by example: Interactive Guide to help you along.\nTo understand Linux, one must understand its commercial predecessor, Unix. One of the things that made Unix\nGrep By Example is also available as a PDF Minibook, and a Grep playground helps you learn quickly.\n(and then Linux) unique was its philosophy: Write programs that work together, do one thing well, and handle text streams.\u00a0 This philosophy describes a huge number of programs, and one of these programs is Grep. Its installed everywhere theres a *nix installed, and once one becomes familiar with it, their command-line-fu reaches an all new level.\nAt its core, Grep is simply a bloodhound. Its scent? A magical incantation called Regular Expressions. Regular Expressions (aka Regex) are simply a way of describing what a stream of text should look like. So when you feed Grep a bit of Regular Expression, it Prints\u00a0only the text that matches that expression. Neat, right?\nThe trouble is that Regex can be kind of hard, and Grep has various versions and capabilities that need to be learned. And this is where the article shines- it covers both in an excellent interactive tutorial thatll help you become a Grep Guru in no time.

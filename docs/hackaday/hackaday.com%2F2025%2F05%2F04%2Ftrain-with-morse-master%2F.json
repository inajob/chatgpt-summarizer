However, these days, there are a great many tools to aid in the learning process. A good example is the Morse Master from [Arnov Sharma].\nThe Morse Master is a translator for Morse code, which works in two ways. You can access it via a web app, and type in regular letters which it then flashes out as code on its in-built LEDs. Alternatively, you can enter Morse manually using the physical key, and the results will be displayed on the web app. The Morse key itself is built into the enclosure using 3D printed components paired with a Cherry-style keyboard switch. Its perhaps not the ideal solution for fast keying, with its limited rebound, but its a quick and easy way to make a functional key for practice purposes. If you want to go faster, though, you might want to upgrade to something more capable. Wed also love to see a buzzer added, since Morse is very much intended as an auditory method of communication.\nWeve seen some other great Morse code trainers before, too. If youve trained yourself in this method of communication, dont hesitate to share your own learning tips below.\n\n"}

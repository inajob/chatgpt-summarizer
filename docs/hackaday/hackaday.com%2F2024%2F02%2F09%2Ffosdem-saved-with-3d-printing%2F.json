But as the organizers of FOSDEM in Brussels found out, whats really the most important part of such an event is the toilet paper.\nIf you cant keep the supplies coming, youre in trouble, and since they only had one key for the dispensers across the whole event, they were heading for a sticky situation. But this is a hacker event, and our community is resourceful. The folks on the FreeCAD booth created a model of the key which they shared via the Ondsel collaboration tools, while those on the Prusa booth fired up their Prusa XL and ran off a set of keys to keep the event well supplied.\nPerhaps for many of us, the act of running off a 3D model and printing it is such a mundane task as to be unremarkable  and indeed the speed at which they were able to do it points to it being a straightforward task for them. But the sight of a bunch of hardware hackers saving the event by doing what they do best is still one to warm the cockles of our hearts. Were fairly certain its not the first time weve seen a bit of clandestine venue hacking save an event, but perhaps for the sake of those involved, wed better not go into it.", "title": "\u300c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u3082\u306e\u306f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc!?\u300d", "body": "FOSDEM\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u89e3\u6c7a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002FreeCAD\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u9375\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u3001Prusa\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u9375\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u88dc\u7d66\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u8e8d\u304c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6551\u3063\u305f\u3002\u904e\u53bb\u306b\u3082\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3092\u6551\u3063\u305f\u4f8b\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304c\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u660e\u304b\u3055\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u3082\u306e\u306f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc!?\u300d", "\u300c\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u4e0d\u8db3\u3092\u6551\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u5275\u9020\u529b\u898b\u305b\u308b\u3001\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u5bfe\u7b56\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u6551\u3063\u305f\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf\u300d"]}

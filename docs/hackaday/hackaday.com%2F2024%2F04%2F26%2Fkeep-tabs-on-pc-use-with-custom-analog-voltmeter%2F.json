Most are going to simply display on the screen but this data can be sent to external CPU monitors as well. This retro-styled monitor built on analog voltmeters does a great job of this and adds some flair to a modern workstation as well.\nThe build, known as bbMonitor, is based on the ESP32 platform which controls an array of voltmeters via PWM. The voltmeters have been modified with a percentage display to show things like CPU use percentage. Software running on the computers sends this data in real time to the ESP32 so the computers behavior can be viewed at a glance. Each voltmeter is also augmented with RGB LEDs that change color from green to red as use increases as well. The projects creator, [Corebb], also notes that the gauges will bounce around if the computer is under heavy load but act more linearly when under constant load, also helping to keep an eye on computer status.\nWhile the build does seem to rely on a Windows machine to run the software for export to the monitor, all of the code is open-sourced and available on the projects GitHub page and could potentially be adapted for other operating systems. And, as far as the voltmeters themselves go, there have been similar projects in the past that use stepper motors as a CPU usage monitor instead.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u69d8\u5f0f\u306eCPU\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092ESP32\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c", "body": "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u8981\u6c42\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3001CPU\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3084\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306a\u3069\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u76e3\u8996\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002bbMonitor\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001ESP32\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u500b\u6027\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u69d8\u5f0f\u306eCPU\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092ESP32\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ee2\u9001\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306abbMonitor\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "CPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3092\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc", "RGB LED\u3067\u8ca0\u8377\u72b6\u6cc1\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3066\u72ec\u81ea\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd"]}

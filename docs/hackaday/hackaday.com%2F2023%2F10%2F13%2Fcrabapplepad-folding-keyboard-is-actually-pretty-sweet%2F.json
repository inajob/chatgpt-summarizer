But once [Sergei] started writing notes in coffee shops, it was time for something portable.\nThe trouble with many portable keyboards, especially folding ones, is that theyre not often comfortable to type on. However, the Crabapplepad, a sleek, elegant offering, looks as though it begs to differ.\n[Sergei] truly thought of everything and packed it into this 2cm thick wonder. Theres a little kickstand to hold your phone, or you can just throw an Apple trackpad between the halves and it magnetically attaches. Inside theres a Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840, and the switches are the extremely thin and hard-to-find Kailh PG1425 X, a sweet-looking scissor switch.\nThe only problem with X-switches is that there is only one type of keycap for them at the moment, and there arent any homing bums for F and J. To get around this, [Sergei] designed some 3D-printed frames to go around the keycaps and make them more distinct. Yes, this beauty it is open source, so go forth and be comfortable in absolute style. Dont forget to check out the demo after the break.\nTo be honest, there once was a pretty good folding keyboard  the Palm Portable. Dont worry; someone made a Bluetooth adapter for them.\n\n\nVia r/ergomechkeyboards", "title": "\u300c2cm\u539a\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001Crabapplepad\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "body": "Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u3067\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u643a\u5e2f\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Crabapplepad\u306f\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002Sergei\u6c0f\u304c\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3057\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c2cm\u539a\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001Crabapplepad\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300c\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u300d", "\u300cApple\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3068\u78c1\u6c17\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\uff01Crabapplepad\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u300d", "\u300cKailh PG1425 X\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "\u300c\u72ec\u81ea\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u300d"]}

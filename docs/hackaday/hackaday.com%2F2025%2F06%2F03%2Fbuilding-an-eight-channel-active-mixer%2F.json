If you wanted something different, or just a nice learning experience, you could craft your own instead. Thats precisely what [Something Physical] did.\u00a0\nThe build was inspired by an earlier 3-channel mixer designed by [Moritz Klein]. This project stretches to eight channels, which is nice, because somehow it feels right that a mixers total channels always land on a multiple of four. As you might expect, the internals are fairly straightforward\u2014its just about lacing together all the separate op-amp gain stages, pots, and jacks, as well as a power LED so you can tell when its switched on. Its all wrapped up in a slant-faced wooden box with an aluminum face plate and Dymo labels. Old-school, functional, and fit for purpose.\nIts a simple build, but a satisfying one; theres something beautiful about recording on audio gear youve hewn yourself. Once youve built your mixer, you might like to experiment in the weird world of no-input mixing. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "body": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u611f\u3084\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "- \uff14\u306e\u500d\u6570\u304c\u9b45\u529b\uff01\uff18\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\uff06\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306a\u6728\u88fd\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u30ce\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30c3\u30c8\u30df\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055"]}

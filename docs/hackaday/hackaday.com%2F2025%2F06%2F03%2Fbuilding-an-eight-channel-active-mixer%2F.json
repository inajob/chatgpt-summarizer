If you wanted something different, or just a nice learning experience, you could craft your own instead. Thats precisely what [Something Physical] did.\u00a0\nThe build was inspired by an earlier 3-channel mixer designed by [Moritz Klein]. This project stretches to eight channels, which is nice, because somehow it feels right that a mixers total channels always land on a multiple of four. As you might expect, the internals are fairly straightforward\u2014its just about lacing together all the separate op-amp gain stages, pots, and jacks, as well as a power LED so you can tell when its switched on. Its all wrapped up in a slant-faced wooden box with an aluminum face plate and Dymo labels. Old-school, functional, and fit for purpose.\nIts a simple build, but a satisfying one; theres something beautiful about recording on audio gear youve hewn yourself. Once youve built your mixer, you might like to experiment in the weird world of no-input mixing. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

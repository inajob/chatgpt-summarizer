However, sometimes its nice to have simple data displayed on a bespoke device. Thats what inspired [Mario] to create ESPTimeCast.\u00a0\nAs you might have guessed by the name, the project is designed around the ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers; either one is up to the task of running the show here. Both come with Wi-Fi connectivity out of the box, which makes it easy for them to hook up to the Internet to query NTP servers for the time and weather data from OpenWeatherMap. The data is then displayed on an LED matrix display, made up of four 88 LED modules and driven with the aid of the MAX7219 IC. Configuration is handled over a simple web interface hosted on the device itself. All the parts are wrapped up in a 3D-printed housing that would be very fitting in any home that appreciates the magic of late 60s/early 70s decor.\nHackers love building clocks, weather stations, and other useful information displays. Weve seen a great many examples over the years. If youre cooking up your own neat project in this area, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

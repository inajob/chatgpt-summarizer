Then it was kind of amusing to do so with USB, and before you knew it, we were running whole laptops off what started out as a data connector. These days, its not unusual to run a soldering iron off USB-C, or, as [MarkTheQuasiEngineer] has done\u2014a hotplate!\nThis hotplate is not for quesadillas, nor samosas. Instead, its a tiny hotplate for tiny reflow tasks. Given many PCBs are quite small, theres no need for a huge hot plate to get your circuits assembled.\nThe device relies on metal ceramic heating elements to provide the warmth. An NTC thermistor is used for monitoring the temperature for accurate control, which is handled by the STM32 microcontroller thats running the show. It also drives a small display indicating the mode of operation and current temperature. The STM32 controls the power going to the heating element from the USB-C feed with a stout power MOSFET.\nSadly, the project hasnt been a complete success. With a PCB on the plate, [MarkTheQuasiEngineer] was only able to achieve peak temperatures of around 200 C. Thats not great for doing proper reflow, but its a start. He believes upgrading to a more powerful supply to feed the hotplate will help.\nWeve featured some other great reflow hotplates before too.\n\n"}

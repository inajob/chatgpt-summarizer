One such stability attempt involves so-called topological quantum computing with the use of anyons, which are two-dimensional quasiparticles. Such an approach has been claimed by Microsoft in a recent paper in\u00a0Nature. This comes a few years after an earlier claim by Microsoft for much the same feat, which was found to be based on faulty science and hence retracted.\nThe claimed creation of anyons here involves Majorana fermions, which differ from the much more typical Dirac fermions. These Majorana fermions are bound with other such fermions as a Majorana zero mode (MZM), forming anyons that are intertwined (braided) to form what are in effect logic gates. In the\u00a0Nature\u00a0paper the Microsoft researchers demonstrate a superconducting indium-arsenide (InAs) nanowire-based device featuring a read-out circuit\u00a0 (quantum dot interferometer) with the capacitance of one of the quantum dots said to vary in a way that suggests that the nanowire device-under-test demonstrates the presence of MZMs at either end of the wire.\nMicrosoft has a dedicated website to their quantum computing efforts, though it remains essential to stress that this is not a confirmation until their research is replicated by independent researchers. If confirmed, MZMs could provide a way to create more reliable quantum computing circuitry that does not have to lean so heavily on error correction to get any usable output. Other, competing efforts here include such things as hybrid mechanical qubits and antimony-based qubits that should be more stable owing to their eight spin configurations.", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u91cf\u5b50\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5b89\u5b9a\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f", "body": "\u91cf\u5b50\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306f\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30e8\u30e9\u30ca\u7c92\u5b50\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u91cf\u5b50\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5b89\u5b9a\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f", "- \u30c8\u30dd\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u91cf\u5b50\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a\u30a8\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u5275\u88fd\u3068\u30de\u30b8\u30e7\u30e9\u30ca\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30df\u30aa\u30f3\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u91cf\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u7d61\u307f\u5408\u3063\u305f\u30a8\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8ad6\u7406\u30b2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u8ad6\u6587\uff1a\u8d85\u4f1d\u5c0e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a6\u30e0-\u30d2\u7d20\u30ca\u30ce\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u91cf\u5b50\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u30de\u30b8\u30e7\u30e9\u30ca\u30bc\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6709\u671b\u6027\u3068\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u6027\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

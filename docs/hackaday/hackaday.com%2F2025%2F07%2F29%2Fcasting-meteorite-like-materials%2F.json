This reveals their Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, a latticework structure of parallel iron-nickel intermetallic crystals which forms over millions of years of very slow solidification. Inspired by this, [Electron Impressions] created his own metal composition which forms similar patterns on a much-faster-than-geological time scale.\nWitmanst\u00e4tten patterns form when a meteorite colliding with a planet launches molten iron and nickel into space, where they very slowly solidify. As the mixture cools, it first forms a stable phase called Taenite, then begins to precipitate another phase called Kamacite. Kamacite forms needle-shaped crystals, which when polished show up against the Taenite background. However, such needle-shaped growth only becomes noticeable at a cooling rate of a few degrees per million years, so it\u2019s not really a practical way to make the pattern.\nInstead of iron-nickel, therefore, [Electron Impressions] used a copper-aluminium alloy. The copper-aluminium system contains an intermetallic compound which forms large rod-shaped crystals, as well as a eutectic copper-aluminium alloy which can form a background for the crystals. For his first attempt, [Electrons Impressions] melted a composition of 45% copper and 55% aluminium, which produced large crystals on slow cooling. This had a visibly different structure than Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, so to reduce the numbers of crystals, he tried again with 40% copper. This produced a criss-cross crystal pattern, not quite a Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern, but very similar, and good enough for decorative purposes.\nWhen a meteorite collides with a planet and ejects material, the impact can be dramatic enough for amateur astronomers to capture. If you\u2019re looking for something closer to home, it\u2019s also possible to grow non-intermetallic copper crystals.\n\nThanks to [Zane Atkins] for the tip!", "title": "\u9244\u9695\u77f3\u306e\u30a6\u30a3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3\u6a21\u69d8\u3068\u305d\u306e\u751f\u6210\u904e\u7a0b", "body": "\u9244\u9695\u77f3\u306e\u30a6\u30a3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3\u6a21\u69d8\u306b\u7740\u60f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u9285-\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u5408\u91d1\u3067\u3001\u985e\u4f3c\u306e\u6a21\u69d8\u3092\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u751f\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u9244\u9695\u77f3\u306e\u30a6\u30a3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3\u6a21\u69d8\u3068\u305d\u306e\u751f\u6210\u904e\u7a0b", "\u9285-\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u5408\u91d1\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u7d50\u6676\u6a21\u69d8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "\u9695\u77f3\u306e\u885d\u7a81\u3068\u91d1\u5c5e\u7d50\u6676\u5f62\u6210\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "\u30a6\u30a3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3\u6a21\u69d8\u306e\u901f\u6210\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9285\u7d50\u6676\u306e\u80b2\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f"]}

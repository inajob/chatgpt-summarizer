This reveals their Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, a latticework structure of parallel iron-nickel intermetallic crystals which forms over millions of years of very slow solidification. Inspired by this, [Electron Impressions] created his own metal composition which forms similar patterns on a much-faster-than-geological time scale.\nWitmanst\u00e4tten patterns form when a meteorite colliding with a planet launches molten iron and nickel into space, where they very slowly solidify. As the mixture cools, it first forms a stable phase called Taenite, then begins to precipitate another phase called Kamacite. Kamacite forms needle-shaped crystals, which when polished show up against the Taenite background. However, such needle-shaped growth only becomes noticeable at a cooling rate of a few degrees per million years, so it\u2019s not really a practical way to make the pattern.\nInstead of iron-nickel, therefore, [Electron Impressions] used a copper-aluminium alloy. The copper-aluminium system contains an intermetallic compound which forms large rod-shaped crystals, as well as a eutectic copper-aluminium alloy which can form a background for the crystals. For his first attempt, [Electrons Impressions] melted a composition of 45% copper and 55% aluminium, which produced large crystals on slow cooling. This had a visibly different structure than Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, so to reduce the numbers of crystals, he tried again with 40% copper. This produced a criss-cross crystal pattern, not quite a Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern, but very similar, and good enough for decorative purposes.\nWhen a meteorite collides with a planet and ejects material, the impact can be dramatic enough for amateur astronomers to capture. If you\u2019re looking for something closer to home, it\u2019s also possible to grow non-intermetallic copper crystals.\n\nThanks to [Zane Atkins] for the tip!"}

This would definitely seem to be the case with fingerprint sensors as found on a range of laptops that are advertised as being compatible with Windows Hello. It all began when Microsoft\u2019s Offensive Research and Security Engineering (MORSE) asked the friendly people over at Blackwing Intelligence to take a poke at a few of these laptops, only for them to subsequently blow gaping holes in the security of the three laptops they examined.\nIn the article by [Jesse DAguanno] and\u00a0[Timo Ter\u00e4s] the basic system and steps they took to defeat it are described. The primary components are the fingerprint sensor and Microsofts Secure Device Connection Protocol (SDCP), with the latter tasked with securing the (USB) connection between the sensor and the host. Theoretically the sensitive fingerprint-related data stays on the sensor with all matching performed there (Match on Chip, MoC) as required by the Windows Hello standard, and SDCP keeping prying eyes at bay.\nInterestingly, the three laptops examined (Dell Inspiron 15, Lenovo ThinkPad T14 and Microsoft Surface Pro X) all featured different sensor brands (Goodix, Synaptics and ELAN), with different security implementations. The first used an MoC with SDCP, but security was much weaker under Linux, which allowed for a fake user to be enrolled. The Synaptics implementation used a secure TLS connection that used part of the information on the laptops model sticker as the key, and the ELAN version didnt even bother with security but responded merrily to basic USB queries.\nTo say that this is a humiliating result for these companies is an understatement, and demonstrates that nobody in his right mind should use fingerprint- or similar scanners like this for access to personal or business information.", "title": "Windows Hello\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u7834\u3089\u308c\u308b", "body": "\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u8106\u5f31\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4e09\u3064\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u3001Linux\u3067\u306f\u507d\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u9332\u3067\u304d\u305f\u308a\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306aUSB\u30af\u30a8\u30ea\u306b\u5fdc\u7b54\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3069\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5b9f\u88c5\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u91cd\u5927\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u3084\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u306b\u306f\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u5506\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Windows Hello\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u7834\u3089\u308c\u308b", "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u3059\u308b", "Linux\u74b0\u5883\u4e0b\u3067\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u5f31\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5224\u660e", "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5b9f\u88c5\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03\u3059\u308b", "\u6307\u7d0b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3084\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b"]}

Or at least, thats the easiest way to go about it and the one most likely to get you good, intelligible audio. You dont have to go that way, though, as [antirez] demonstrates.\n[antirez] decided to do this with a Pi Pico, but its applicable to other microcontrollers too. Its all done with a single pin and a PWM output. The PWM output is set to a very high frequency beyond human hearing. In this case, it was 100 KHz. Then, the duty cycle of the PWM is changed to essentially output various average voltage levels at the pin. Vary the output voltage as per your desired sound file by using each sample to vary the duty cycle of the PWM. Voila! You can output whatever sound you want on that pin! [antirez] steps through the basics of doing this, including processing simple WAV files into a raw format that can be dumped into MicroPython code.\nTheres no sound sample on the project page, and wed have to assume it sounds pretty crunchy when hooked up to a speaker. And yet, it could prove a useful technique if youre designing your own audio greeting cards or something, so keep that in mind!"}

Most commercial options are pretty expensive, and come with certain limitations in how they can be controlled. [Smart Solutions For Home] has whipped up a flexible DIY design for decorating your walls with light that is altogether more customizable.\nIn this case, the DIY light panels ape the hexagonal design made popular by brands like Nanoleaf. In this case, each hexagon panel runs an ESP32 microcontroller, which controls a series of WS2812 addressable LEDs. This allows each panel to glow whatever color you like, and theyre arranged in an XY grid to enable you to light individual panels with a range of different geometric effects. The benefit of having a full microcontroller on each panel is that they can act quite independently\u2014each one able to be used as a smart light, an notification display, or even as a physical button, all integrated with Home Assistant.\nIf youre a fan of DIY smart home products, these might be right up your alley. Theyre supremely flexible and customizable, and can do a lot of things that commercial versions cant easily replicate. Just dont ignore the fact that they require a considerable amount of assembly, what with the custom PCBs, 3D printed enclosures, and front diffusers to deal with. Thats just the way the LED wall crumbles.\nWeve seen other similar builds before, too. Why? The simple fact is that a lot of people want cool glowy panels on their wall without having to pay through the nose for them.\n\n"}

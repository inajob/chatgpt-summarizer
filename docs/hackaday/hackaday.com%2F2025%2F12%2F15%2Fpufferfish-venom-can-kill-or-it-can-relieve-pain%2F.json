You might remember it from an episode of The Simpsons involving a poorly prepared dish at a sushi restaurant. Indeed, its a potent thing, as ingesting even tiny amounts can lead to death in short order.\nGiven its fatal reputation, it might be the last thing youd expect to be used in a therapeutic context. And yet, tetrodotoxin is proving potentially valuable as a treatment option for dealing with cancer-related pain. Its a dangerous thing to play with, but it could yet hold promise where other pain relievers simply cant deliver.\nPoison, or?\nA license to prepare fugu (pufferfish) issued by Tokyo authorities.

It was much later that tetrodotoxin itself was chemically isolated, thanks to the work of Dr. Yoshizumi Tahara in 1909.\nIts method of action was proven in 1964, with tetrodotoxin found to bind to and block voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, essentially stopping the nerves from conducting signals as normal. It thus has the effect of inducing paralysis, up to the point where an afflicted individual suffers respiratory failure, and subsequently, death.\nTetrodotoxin is most closely associated with pufferfish, though its also present in other deadly species, like the blue-ringed octopus. Thankfully, nobody is crazy enough to try to eat those. Credit: NPS, public domain\nIt doesnt take a large dose of tetrodotoxin to kill, either\u2014the median lethal dose in mice is a mere 334 \u03bcg per kilogram when ingested. The lethality of tetrodotoxin was historically a prime driver behind Japanese efforts to specially license chefs who wished to prepare and serve pufferfish. Consuming pufferfish that has been inadequately prepared can lead to symptoms in 30 minutes or less, with death following in mere hours as the toxin makes it impossible for the sufferer to breathe. Notably, though, with the correct life support measures, particularly for the airway, or with a sub-fatal dose, its possible for a patient to make a full recovery in mere days, without any lingering effects.\nThe effects that tetrodotoxin has on the nervous system are precisely what may lend it therapeutic benefit, however. By blocking sodium channels in sensory neurons that deal with pain signals, the toxin could act as a potent method of pain relief. Researchers have recently explored whether it could have particular application for dealing with neuropathic pain caused by cancer or chemotherapy treatments. This pain isnt always easy to manage with traditional pain relief methods, and can even linger after cancer recovery and when chemotherapy has ceased.\nTetrodotoxin is able to block voltage-gated sodium channels, which is the basis of both its pain-relieving abilities and its capacity to paralyze and kill. Credit: research paper\nThe challenge of using a toxin for pain relief is obvious\u2014theres always a risk that the negative effects of the toxin will outweigh the supposed therapeutic benefit. In the case of tetrodotoxin, it all comes down to dosage. The levels given to patients in research studies have been on the order of 30 micrograms, well under the multi-milligram dose that would typically cause severe symptoms or death in an adult human. The hope would be to find a level at which tetrodotoxin reduces pain with a minimum of adverse effects, particularly where symptoms like paralysis and respiratory failure are on the table.\nA review of various studies worldwide was published in 2023, and highlights that tetrodotoxin pain relief does come with some typical adverse effects, even at tiny clinical doses. The most typical reported symptoms involved nausea, oral numbness, dizziness, and tingling sensations. In many cases, these effects were mild and well-tolerated. A small number of patients in research trials exhibited more serious symptoms, however, such as loss of muscle control, pain, or hypertension. At the same time, the treatment did show positive results \u2014 with many patients reporting pain relief for days or even weeks after just a few days of tetrodotoxin injections.\nWhile tetrodotoxin has been studied as a pain reliever for several decades now, it has yet to become a mainstream treatment. There have been no large-scale studies that involved treating more than 200 patients, and no research group or pharmaceutical company has pushed hard to bring a tetrodotoxin-based product to market. Research continues, with a 2025 paper even exploring the use of ultra-low nanogram-scale doses in a topical setting. For now, though, commercial application remains a far-off fantasy. Today, the toxin remains the preserve of pufferfish and a range of other deadly species. Dont expect to see it in a hospital ward any time soon, despite the promise it shows thus far.\nFeatured image: Puffer Fish DSC01257.JPG by Brocken Inaglory.

Thats the whole idea behind FallingWater, a gorgeous Art Deco inspired clock created by [Mark Wilson]  while the vertical LCD might look like some wild custom component, its simply a common DM8BA10 display module thats been rotated 90 degrees.\nAs demonstrated in the video below, by turning the LCD on its side, [Mark] is able to produce some visually striking animations. At the same time the display is still perfectly capable of showing letters and numbers, albeit in a single column and with noticeably wider characters.\nIn another application it might look odd, but when combined with the \u201csunburst\u201d style enclosure, it really comes together. Speaking of the enclosure, [Mark] used OpenSCAD to visualize the five layer stack-up, which was then recreated in Inkscape so it could ultimately be laser-cut from acrylic.\nRounding out the build is a Leonardo Tiny ATmega32U4 board, a DS3221 real-time clock (RTC), a couple of pushbuttons, and a light dependent resistor (LDR) used to dim the display when the ambient light level is low. All of the electronics are housed on a small custom PCB, making for a nicely compact package.\nThis build is as simple as it is stylish, and we wouldnt be surprised if it inspired more than a few clones. At the time of writing, [Mark] hadnt published the source code for the ATmega, but he has provided the code to generate the cut files for the enclosure, as well as the Gerber files for the PCB. If you come up with your own version of this retro-futuristic timepiece, let us know.\n\n", "title": "- \u9b45\u60d1\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30b3\u6642\u8a08\u300cFallingWater\u300d\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30b3\u98a8\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u300cFallingWater\u300d\u306f\u3001LCD\u309290\u5ea6\u56de\u8ee2\u3055\u305b\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9b45\u60d1\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30b3\u6642\u8a08\u300cFallingWater\u300d\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- 90\u5ea6\u56de\u8ee2\u306eLCD\u3067\u9b45\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- OpenSCAD\u3068Inkscape\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb", "- \u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

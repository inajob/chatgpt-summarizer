They consist of spinning tops, which are designed to fight in arenas by knocking each other around. While the off-the-shelf models are deemed safe enough for children to play with, [Jon Bringus] decided to take the danger level up a few notches with some custom launchers of his own design.\n[Jon]s project started with some of the early metal Beyblades, which are traditionally launched with a small geared ripcord device. He soon realized he could up the action by doing one simple thing\u2014spinning the tops far faster than the manufacturer ever intended. More rotational speed equals more kinetic energy equals more legal liability fun, or so the equation goes.\nThe design for [Jons] WMD Launcher is straightforward enough\u2014he combined a lawnmower pull starter with a 12:1 geartrain to turn the Beyblades at truly ludicrous speeds. Its basic engineering \u2014 a couple of 3D-printed gears do the job \u2014 but the results are hilarious. The tops begin to emit loud noises as they turn in combat, and some move so fast and erratically that they wont even stay inside the arena. Protective eyewear is virtually mandatory. Files are on Printables for those eager to build one at home.\nYes, ruining a game of Beyblades is as simple as building an irresponsibly fast launcher. You neednt even use some fancy brushless motor to hurt yourself \u2014 just a little gearing is enough to cause havoc. Weve featured similar work on this topic before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u66f4\u306a\u308b\u30b9\u30ea\u30eb\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u305f\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "Beyblade\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u767a\u5c04\u6a5f\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u56de\u8ee2\u3067\u904a\u3076\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- \u66f4\u306a\u308b\u30b9\u30ea\u30eb\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u305f\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u52a0\u901f\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff01\u5371\u967a\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u7206\u901f\u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u7b11\u6483\u306e\u6226\u3044\uff01\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u56de\u308b\u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u5fc5\u898b\uff01DIY\u30d9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u516c\u958b"]}

A lot of familiar names produced these high-end systems, including the king of the minicomputer world, DEC. The late-80s version of their DECstation line had a MIPS processor, and ran ULTRIX and DECWindows, their versions of UNIX and X respectively. When we used one back in the day it was a very high-end machine, but now as [rscott2049] shows us, it can be emulated on an RP2040 microcontroller.\nOn the business card sized board is an RP2040, 32 MB of PSRAM, an Ethernet interface, and a VGA socket. The keyboard and mouse are USB. It drives a monochrome screen at 1024 x 864 pixels, which would have been quite something over three decades ago.\nIts difficult to communicate how powerful a machine like this felt back in the very early 1990s, when by todays standards it seems laughably low-spec. Its worth remembering though that the software of the day was much less demanding and lacking in bloat. Wed be interested to see whether this could be used as an X server to display a more up-to-date application on another machine, for at least an illusion of a modern web browser loading Hackaday on DECWindows.\nFull details of the project can be found in its GitHub repository.", "title": "RP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067DECstation\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "\u904e\u53bb\u3001PC\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u666e\u53ca\u578b\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3068\u3001UNIX\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9593\u306b\u660e\u78ba\u306a\u5206\u304b\u308c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002DEC\u306f\u305d\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u3067\u3001MIPS\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fDECstation\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u306fRP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u305d\u306e\u6a21\u5023\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002GitHub\u3067\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["RP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067DECstation\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eDECstation\u3092RP2040\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30de\u30b7\u30f3DECstation\u306eRP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eRP2040\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067DECstation\u3092\u518d\u73fe", "DECstation\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3: RP2040\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u8a73\u7d30GitHub\u3067\u3054\u78ba\u8a8d\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044"]}

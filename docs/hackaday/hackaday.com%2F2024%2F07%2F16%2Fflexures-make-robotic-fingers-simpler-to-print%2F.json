What works well in bone and sinew often doesnt translate well to servos and sensors, and even building a single mechanical finger can require dozens of parts.\nOr, if youre as clever about things as [Adrian Perez] is, only one part. His print-in-place robotic finger, adorably dubbed Fingie, is a huge step toward simplifying anthropomorphic manipulators. Fingie is printed in PLA and uses flexures for the three main joints of the finger, each of which consists of two separate and opposed coil springs. The flexures allow the phalanges to bend relative to each other in response to the motion of three separate tendons that extend through a channel on the palmar aspect of the finger, very much like the real thing.\nThe flexures eliminate the need for bearings at each joint and greatly decrease the complexity of the finger, but the model isnt perfect. As [Adrian] points out, the off-center attachment for the tendons makes the finger tend to curl when the joints are in flexion, which isnt how real fingers work. That should be a pretty easy fix, though. And while we appreciate the one and done nature of this print, wed almost like to see the strap-like print-in-place tendons replaced with pieces of PLA filament added as a post-processing step, to make the finger more compact and perhaps easier to control.\nDespite the shortcomings, and keeping in mind that this is clearly a proof of concept, we really like where [Adrian] is going with this, and were looking forward to seeing a hand with five Fingies, or four Fingies and a Thumbie. It stands to be vastly simpler than something like [Will Cogley]s biomimetic hand, which while an absolute masterpiece of design, is pretty daunting for most of us to reproduce.\n\n\nThanks to [Hari Wiguna] for the heads up on this one.", "title": "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc", "body": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30ed\u30dd\u30e2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u624b\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3067\u3001\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u3084\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u7ffb\u8a33\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3001Adrian Perez\u306eFingie\u306f\u3001\u7c21\u7565\u5316\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u6307\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u95a2\u7bc0\u90e8\u5206\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u3092\u6392\u9664\u3057\u3001\u624b\u306e\u904b\u52d5\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u69cb\u9020\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30d7\u30e2\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30cb\u30d4\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u306b\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc", "\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u66f2\u3052\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1"]}

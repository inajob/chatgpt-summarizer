But starting a fire 200 years ago? Thats a different story.\nOne method wed never heard of was D\u00f6bereiners lamp, an 1823 invention by German chemist Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner. At first glance, the device seems a little sketchy, what with a tank of sulfuric acid and a piece of zinc to create a stream of hydrogen gas ignited by a platinum catalyst. But as [Marbs Lab] shows with the recreation in the video below, while its not exactly as pocket-friendly as a Zippo, the device actually has some inherent safety features.\n[Marb]s version is built mainly from laboratory glassware, with a beaker of dilute sulfuric acid  Add acid to water, like you ought-er!  bathing a chunk of zinc on a fixed support. An inverted glass funnel acts as a gas collector, which feeds the hydrogen gas to a nozzle through a pinch valve. The hydrogen gas never mixes with oxygen  that would be bad  and the production of gas stops once the gas displaces the sulfuric acid below the level of the zinc pellet. Its a clever self-limiting feature that probably contributed to the commercial success of the invention back in the day.\nTo produce a flame, D\u00f6bereiner originally used a platinum sponge, which catalyzed the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in the air; the heat produced by the reaction was enough to ignite the mixture and produce an open flame. [Marb] couldnt come up with enough of the precious metal, so instead harvested the catalyst from a lighter fluid-fueled hand warmer. The catalyst wasnt quite enough to generate an open flame, but it glowed pretty brightly, and would be more than enough to start a fire.\nHats off to [Marb] for the great lesson is chemical ingenuity and history. Weve seen similar old-school catalytic lighters before, too.\n\n\nThanks to [M. Bindhammer] for the tip.", "title": "\"1823\u5e74\u306e\u30c9\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\uff1a\u706b\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u5929\u624d\u7684\u767a\u660e\"", "body": "1823\u5e74\u306b\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u8005\u30e8\u30cf\u30f3\u30fb\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30d5\u30ac\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30c7\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u767a\u660e\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u786b\u9178\u3068\u4e9c\u925b\u3067\u767a\u751f\u3055\u305b\u305f\u6c34\u7d20\u30ac\u30b9\u3092\u767d\u91d1\u89e6\u5a92\u3067\u767a\u706b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u5099\u308f\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u706b\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u306e\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"1823\u5e74\u306e\u30c9\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\uff1a\u706b\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u5929\u624d\u7684\u767a\u660e\"", "\"\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30ac\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u52d5\u70b9\u706b\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\"", "\"\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7: \u706b\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5927\u6b63\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\"", "\"\u5e0c\u5c11\u306a\u767d\u91d1\u89e6\u5a92\u3092\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u706b\u5668\u88c5\u7f6e\"", "\"\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u30c9\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7: \u706b\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u306e\u529b\""]}

A case in point: [VoltLog] demonstrates that you can add WiFi to the scope using a cheap USB WiFi adapter. This might seem like a no-brainer on the surface, but because the software doesnt know about WiFi, there are a few minor hoops to jump through.\nThe first issue is that you need a WiFi adapter the built-in OS already knows how to handle. The community has identified at least one RTL chipset that works and it happens to be in the TP-Link TL-WN725N. These are old 2.4 GHz only units, so they are widely available for $10 or less.\nBut even with the correct hardware, the scope doesnt have any menus to configure the WiFi interface. To solve that, you need to temporarily use a USB hub and a USB keyboard. Once you have everything plugged in, you can use the Super + N keyboard shortcut to open up the Android notification bar, which is normally hidden. Once youve setup the network connection, you wont need the keyboard anymore.\nOr maybe not  it turns out the keyboard does allow you to change a few other things. For example, [VoltLog] used it to increase the screen brightness more than the default maximum setting.\nThe only other issue appears to be that the scope shows it is disconnected even when connected to WiFi. That doesnt seem to impact operation, though. Of course, you could use a WiFi to Ethernet bridge or even an old router, but now you have a cable, a box, and another power cord to deal with. This solution is neat and clean. You bet weve already ordered a TP-Link adapter!\nWiFi scopes are nothing new. We suspect Rigol didnt want to worry about interference and regulatory acceptance, but who knows? Besides, it is fun to add WiFi to wired devices.\n\n"}

One downside of sealing the space in this fashion, though, is the new problem of venting the space to provide fresh air to the occupants. This 3D printed vent system looks to improve things.\n\n\n\nKnown as the AutoDuct, the shutter and fan combination is designed to help vent apartments with decentralized systems. It can automatically control airflow and also reduces external noise passing through the system using a printed shutter mechanism which is also designed to keep out cold air on windy days.\nA control system enables features like scheduling and automatic humidity control. A mobile app is available for more direct control if needed. The system itself can also integrate into various home automation systems like Apples HomeKit.\n\n\n\nA 100% passive house thats also as energy-efficient as possible might be an unobtainable ideal, but the closer we can get, the better. Some other projects weve seen lately to help climate control systems include this heat pump control system and this automatic HVAC duct booster fan system.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

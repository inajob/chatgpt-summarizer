The process was then demonstrated in a video by [Dammit Jeff].\nCurrently only two devices are supported by this jailbreak, with the Echo Show 5 being the other one. If theres enough interest, there doesnt appear to be any technical reason at least for why this support couldnt be extended to other devices. One major reason for jailbreaking is to put LineageOS on your Echo device courtesy of these Echo Show devices recently beginning to show advertisements, with no way to disable this.\nThe process of jailbreaking and installing the LineageOS ROM is somewhat long as usual, with plenty of points where you can make a tragic mistake. Fortunately its pretty simple as long as you follow the steps and afterwards you can even install the Google apps package if thats your thing. Just mind the 1 GB RAM and 8 GB of storage on the Echo Show 8. In the case of [Jeff] he mostly replicated the home automation and entertainment features of Amazons FireOS with far less locked-down alternatives like Home Assistant.\n\n"}

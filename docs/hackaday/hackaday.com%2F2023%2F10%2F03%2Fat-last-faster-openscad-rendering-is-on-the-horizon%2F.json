Its a very capable piece of software, but regular users will tell you that it can be rather slow when it comes to rendering your work. Were very pleased to see that a fix for this has been produced courtesy of [@ochafik], can now be found as an experimental feature in nightly builds, and will in due course no doubt find its way to official releases.\nDespite a modern computer invariably having a multi-core architecture, it might surprise you to find that OpenSCAD wasnt able to take advantage of this previously. The above-linked thread spans over a decade of experimenting and contains some fascinating discussions if youre prepared to wade through it, and culminates a few weeks ago in the announcement of the new feature giving access to multiple CPUs. We dont have it yet, but its great to know its in the works and were looking forward to render time involving considerably less of a wait.\nSo many OpenSCAD projects have passed through these pages over the years, its safe to say that it has a significant user base among Hackaday readers. Its still something an AI hasnt mastered yet though.\nThanks [pca006132] for the tip.", "title": "OpenSCAD\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f", "body": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u754c\u9762\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u5411\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308bOpenSCAD\u306b\u3001\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u901f\u304f\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u8907\u6570CPU\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u5f85\u3061\u6642\u9593\u304c\u77ed\u7e2e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u898b\u8fbc\u307f\u3002", "titles": ["OpenSCAD\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u901f\u5ea6\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f", "OpenSCAD\u304c\u8907\u6570\u306eCPU\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u306e\u8aad\u8005\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u308bOpenSCAD\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "OpenSCAD\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3067\u3059", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5f97\u610f\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306e3D CAD\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3001OpenSCAD\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831"]}

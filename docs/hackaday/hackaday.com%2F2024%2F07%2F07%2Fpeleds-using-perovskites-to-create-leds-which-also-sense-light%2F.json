One of the technologies being worked on is called PeLED, for Perovskite LED. As a semiconductor material, it can both be induced to emit photons as well as respond rather strongly to incoming photons. That is a trick that todays displays havent managed without integrating additional sensors. This technology could be used to create e.g. touch screens without additional hardware, as recently demonstrated by [Chunxiong Bao] and colleagues at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden and Nanjing University in China.\nTheir paper in Nature Electronics describes the construction of photo-responsive metal halide perovskite pixels, covering the typical red (CsPbI3\u2212xBrx), green (FAPbBr3), and blue (CsPbBr3\u2212xClx) wavelengths. The article also describes the displays photo-sensing ability to determine where a finger is placed on the display. In addition, it can work as an ambient light sensor, a scanner, and a solar cell to charge a capacitor. In related research by [Yun Gao] et al. in Nature Electronics, PeLEDs are demonstrated with 1 microsecond response time.\nAs usual with perovskites, their lack of stability remains their primary obstacle. In the article by [Chunxiong Bao] et al. the manufactured device with red pixels was reduced to 80% of initial brightness after 18.5 hours. While protecting the perovskites from oxygen, moisture, etc. helps, this inherent instability may prevent PeLEDs from ever becoming commercialized in display technology. Sounds like a great challenge for the next Hackaday Prize!", "title": "\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u3068\u3057\u3066PeLED\uff08Perovskite LED\uff09\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u306f\u3001\u5149\u3092\u653e\u5c04\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u5149\u306b\u5f37\u304f\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306a\u3069\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u306e\u6b20\u5982\u304c\u8ab2\u984c\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853", "\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u5149\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u753b\u7d20", "\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u5fdc\u7b54\u901f\u5ea61\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u79d2", "\u30da\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8LED\uff08PeLED\uff09\uff1a\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u306e\u8ab2\u984c"]}

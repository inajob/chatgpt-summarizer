This is exactly why [Kens Lab] took on the restoration of a Philco 52-664, a portable AC/DC radio originally sold for $45 in 1953 (a small fortune back then!). Despite its beat-up exterior and faulty guts, [Ken] methodically restored it to working condition. His video details every crackling capacitor and crusty resistor he replaced, and it\u2019s pure catnip for any hacker with a soft spot for analog tech. Does the name Philco ring a bell? Lately, we did cover the restoration of a 1958 Philco Predicta television.\nWhat sets this radio hack apart? To begin with, [Ken] kept the restoration authentic, repurposing original capacitor cans and using era-appropriate materials  right down to boiling out old electrolytics in his wifes discarded cooking pot. But, he went further. Lacking the space for modern components, [Ken] fabbed up a custom mounting solution from stiff styrofoam, fibreboard, and all-purpose glue. He even re-routed the B-wiring with creative terminal hacks. Its a masterclass in patience, precision, and resourcefulness.\nIf this tickles your inner tinkerer, dont miss out on the full video. Its like stepping into a time machine.\n\n", "title": "- 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5fa9\u5143\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3001Ken\u304c\u624b\u6cd5\u3084\u5de5\u592b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Philco 52-664\u306e\u5fa9\u5143", "- \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u5fa9\u5143\u8853", "- \u5275\u610f\u5de5\u592b\u3067\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\uff01\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fee\u5fa9\u306e\u9054\u4eba\u30b1\u30f3\u306e\u6280", "- \u6642\u9593\u65c5\u884c\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\uff01\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u518d\u751f"]}

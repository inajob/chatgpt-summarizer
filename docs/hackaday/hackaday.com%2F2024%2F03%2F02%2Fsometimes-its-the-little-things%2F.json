The idea is so good, and so simple, that it\u2019s almost silly that it\u2019s not standard hacker practice. And above all, it actually helps solve a problem that I\u2019ve got. This is why I read Hackaday every day.\nI2C is great in that it lets you connect up multiple devices to a pair of wires using a very bus architecture. Every device has its own address, the host calls them out, and hopefully all other devices keep quiet while just the right one responds. But what happens when you want to use a few of the same sensors, where each IC has the same address? The usual solution is to buy a multiplexer chip.\nBut many modern microcontrollers, like the ESP32, have an internal multiplexer setup that lets you map the pins with the dedicated hardware peripherals, usually at initialization time. Indeed, I\u2019ve been doing it as an \u201cinit\u201d task so long, I never thought to do it otherwise. But that\u2019s exactly the idea behind [BastelBaus]\u2019s hack \u2013 if you dynamically reassign the pins, you can do the I2C multiplexing with the chip you\u2019ve got. This should probably work for any other chips that have multiple assignable pins for hardware peripherals as well.\nCool idea, but really simple. Why hadn\u2019t I ever thought of it? I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always had this init / mainloop schema in my mind, which for instance the Arduino inherited and formalized in its setup() and loop() functions. Pin mappings go in the init section, right?\nSo what this hack really amounts to, for me, is a rethinking of what\u2019s static and what\u2019s dynamic. It\u2019s always worth questioning your assumptions, especially when you\u2019re facing a problem that requires a creative solution. Sometimes limitations are only in your mind. Have you had your mind opened recently by a tiny little hack?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

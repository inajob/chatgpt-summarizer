[Steve Gibbs] took a Hasbro R2D2 toy robot and decided to give it a brain upgrade along with enhanced sensors. You can see a video of the robot doing its thing and some build details below.\nIn this case, the toy from Hasbro was not working at all, so [Steve] saved it from the dumpster. Instead of a repair, he decided to just gut it and rebuild it with modern electronics. The ultrasonic sensor on the forward toe is a dead giveaway.\nThe robot responds to voice commands better than the original and can play sound effects and clips from Star Wars. You can also control the robot with a phone app. The new or upgraded sensors include microphones, a PIR sensor, a photoresistor to sense light, a smoke and CO2 sensor, a computer vision camera, and, of course, the ultrasonic range finder.\nSome motors and the original speaker are in use, but R2 now sports additional LEDs and servos. All the extras required some surgery on the plastic body. Instead of regular batteries, the bot now uses a LiPo battery, so the old battery compartment was cut out to make more room.\n\nEven if you arent a die-hard Star Wars fan, this is a fantastic project, and May the 4th is right around the corner. These toys arent cheap, but if you can score one with bad electronics, you might be able to find something cheap or  like Steve  even free.\nThese toys are popular hacking targets. Now [Steve] needs a pit droid.\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30b9\u30d6\u30edR2D2\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u304c\u30cf\u30ba\u30d6\u30ed\u306eR2D2\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u97f3\u58f0\u547d\u4ee4\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3001\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u5316\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30b9\u30d6\u30edR2D2\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u58ca\u308c\u305f\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fR2D2\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u8907\u6570\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3R2D2\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

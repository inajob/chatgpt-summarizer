While that has inspired a lot of clock and timekeeping builds, were also seeing some that do entirely different things on a 1 Hz period. [junkdust] has entered the contest with a project that does something rather mathematical once every second.\n[junkdust] wanted to get better acquainted with the venerable ATtiny85, so decided to implement Conways Game of Life on it. The microcontroller is hooked up to a 0.91 OLED display with a resolution of 128 x 32 pixels, however, [junkdust] only elected to implement a 32 x 32 grid for the game itself, using the rest of the display area to report the vital statistics of the game. On power up, the grid is populated with a random population, and the game proceeds, updating once every second.\nIts a neat little desk toy, but more importantly than that, it served as a nicely complicated test project for [junkdust] to get familiar working inside the limitations of the ATtiny85. It may be a humble part, but it can do great things, as weve seen many times before!\n \n\n\n", "title": "- 1Hz\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff1aATtiny85\u3067\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5", "body": "2025 One Hertz Challenge\u3067\u3001ATtiny85\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u30021\u79d2\u3054\u3068\u306b\u66f4\u65b0\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 1Hz\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff1aATtiny85\u3067\u30b3\u30f3\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5", "- OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30a4", "- 1\u79d2\u3054\u3068\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- ATtiny85\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067ATtiny85\u3092\u5b66\u3076"]}

Generic advice, like disabling the HDMI interface and the onboard LED, is omnipresent, but [Manawyrm] from [Kittenlabs] goes beyond the surface-level, and gifts us an extensive write-up where every recommendation is backed with measurements. Armed with the Nordic Power Profiler kit and an SD card mux for quick experimentation, she aimed at two factors, boot time and power consumed while booting, and made sure to get all the debug information we could use.\nThanks to fast experimentation cycles and immediate feedback, we learn plenty of new things about what a Pi Zero does and when, and how we can tame various power-hungry aspects of its behavior. Disabling the GPU or its aspects like HDMI output, tweaking features like HAT and other peripheral probing, and even tactical overclocking during boot  its an extensive look at what makes a Pi Zero tick, and no chance for spreading baseless advice or myths.\nAll in all, this write-up helps you decrease the boot time from twelve seconds to just three seconds, and slash the power budget of the boot process by 80%. Some recommendations are as simple as config.txt entries, while others require you to recompile the kernel. No matter the amount of effort you can put into power optimization, youll certainly find things worth learning while following along, and [Manawyrm]s effort in building her solar-powered Pi setup will help us all build better Pi-Zero-powered solar devices and handhelds.", "title": "Raspberry Pi Zero\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Pi Zero\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u6c60\u99c6\u52d5\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u524a\u6e1b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001[Manawyrm]\u304c\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u8abf\u67fb\u3068\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u6700\u9069\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u6642\u9593\u30923\u79d2\u306b\u77ed\u7e2e\u3057\u3001\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u309280%\u524a\u6e1b\u3002\u30bf\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3084HDMI\u51fa\u529b\u306e\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u306a\u3069\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi Zero\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "Nordic Power Profiler\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fPi Zero\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u8a08\u6e2c", "Pi Zero\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u524a\u6e1b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "boot\u6642\u9593\u77ed\u7e2e\u3068\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u524a\u6e1b\u3078\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fbPi Zero\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6210\u529f\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

Just how much does Russia rely on Western manufacturers parts? It turns out, a surprising amount. For instance, if you are wondering which ICs are used to build Iran-produced Shahed drones, it seems that its a whole bunch of Texas Instruments parts, as well as some Maxim, Intel, and Xilinx ones. Many of the parts in the lists are MCUs and FPGAs, but its also surprising how many of the components are jelly bean parts with multiple suppliers.\nThere appear to be thousands of parts listings, compiled from a good few dozen pieces of equipment that volunteers appear to have taken apart and scrupulously documented  just take a look at the dropdowns at the top of the page. The Ukrainian government is advocating for parts restrictions to be implemented based upon this data  as we all remember, its way harder to produce hardware when you cant buy crucial ICs.\nEven for a regular hacker, this database is worth a scroll, if only to marvel at all the regular parts we wouldnt quite associate with military use. Now, all thats left is to see whether any of the specific chips pictured have been sold to washing machine manufacturers.", "title": "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\uff1a\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9", "body": "\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u653f\u5e9c\u304c\u6700\u8fd1\u3001\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u8ecd\u9700\u54c1\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u897f\u5074\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u3001\u3053\u308c\u306f\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u60c5\u5831\u6e90\u3060\u3002\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u304c\u897f\u5074\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u3069\u308c\u307b\u3069\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3001\u5b9f\u306f\u9a5a\u304f\u307b\u3069\u3060\u3002\u591a\u304f\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u304cTexas Instruments\u3001Maxim\u3001Intel\u3001Xilinx\u306a\u3069\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\uff1a\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u653f\u5e9c\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u8ecd\u4e8b\u88c5\u5099\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u88fd\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u90e8\u54c1\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u516c\u958b", "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u306b\u306fTexas Instruments\u306a\u3069\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u591a\u6570\u4f7f\u7528", "\u90e8\u54c1\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u6570\u5343\u306e\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u30a6\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ca\u653f\u5e9c\u304c\u63d0\u5531\u3057\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u5236\u9650\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027"]}

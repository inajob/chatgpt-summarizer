Elliot Williams and Al Williams decided there were too many to choose from, but they did take a sampling of the ones that caught their attention. This weeks picks were an eclectic mix of everything from metal casting and plasma cutters to radio astronomy and space telescope budgets. In between? Some basic circuit design, 3D printing, games, dogs, and software tools. Sound confusing? It wont be, after you listen to this weeks podcast.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload an audiophile-quality oxygen-free MP3 file here.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 267 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Europe 2024 Is Live\nVCF East 2024 Was Bigger And Better Than Ever \n\nGetting Started With Blinking Lights On Old Iron \n\n\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThis week, both hosts knew what the sound was, so there was no live guessing.

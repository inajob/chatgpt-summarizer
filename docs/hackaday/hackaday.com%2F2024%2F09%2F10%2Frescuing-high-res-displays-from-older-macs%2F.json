This increased pixel density while keeping the standard screen size  idea for those needing a lot of detail for their work. But, as is common with Apple, using these displays outside of the Apple ecosystem can be quite a challenge. Retina displays have been around for about a decade now, though, with some third-party hardware able to break them free of their cage. This post details how [Kevin] liberated the 5K display from a 2017 iMac for more general use with support for USB-C.\nThe first step was to find a used iMac for the right price, and then sell off most of its parts to recoup most of the initial cost. That brought the cost of the panel itself to about $250. The key to getting the display working without all of the Apple hardware is the R1811 driver board, which can be had for around $300. A new 156 watt power supply was added to the mix, and [Kevin] also put in a few extras like a USB cable extension and a latching push-button which kills the displays power. Additionally, he attempted to get the original iMac speakers working with this setup too, but none of his attempts resulted in anything close to quality sound so hes mostly abandoned that extra feature for now.\nWith that all buttoned up, he has a 27 5K display with USB-C input for around $650 which is quite a deal. The MacRumors thread that [Kevin] added his project to currently has around 1,700 posts about similar builds too, so it can be a wealth of information for all kinds of models. As Apple drops support for their older machines, these displays will become more and more common and projects like these can keep a lot of e-waste out of the landfill while also providing decent hardware at a bargain price. Dont just look for iMacs and MacBooks though; theres a similar process to use various iPad displays for other things as well.", "title": "Apple\u306eRetina\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u7528\u9014\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Apple\u304cRetina\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u3066\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u6570\u30924\u500d\u306b\u5897\u3084\u3057\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u9069\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u4fdd\u3061\u3064\u3064\u3001\u753b\u7d20\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067Apple\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30b5\u30fc\u30c9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u958b\u653e\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Apple\u306eRetina\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u7528\u9014\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "2017\u5e74\u306eiMac\u304b\u30895K\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u89e3\u653e\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a27\u30a4\u30f3\u30c15K\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "Apple\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067Retina\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "e\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\uff1a\u53e4\u3044Apple\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

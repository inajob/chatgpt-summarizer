A marvel of DIY engineering that brings the arcade classic Puzzle Bobble to life\u2014once again! Do you remember the original Puzzle Bobble aiming mechanism we featured 12 years ago? Now, creator [TomTilly] has returned with a revamped version, blending ingenuity with a touch of nostalgia. [Tom] truly is a Puzzle Bobble enthusiast. And who could argue that? The games simplicty makes for innocent yet addictive gameplay.\n[Tom]s new setup recreates Puzzle Bobble\u2019s signature aiming mechanic using surprising materials: deodorant roller balls filled with hot glue (to diffuse LED colours), bamboo skewers, and rubber bands. At its heart is an Arduino UNO, which syncs the RGB LED bubbles and a servo-driven aiming arm to the game\u2019s real-time data. A Lua script monitors MAME\u2019s memory locations to match the bubble colours and aimer position.\nBut this isn\u2019t just a static display. [Tom] hints at a version 2.0: a fully functional controller complete with a handle. Imagine steering this tactile masterpiece through Puzzle Bobble\u2019s frantic levels!\nNeed more inspiration? Check out other quirky hacks like [Tom]s deodorant roller controller we featured in 2023. Whether you\u2019re into cardboard mechanics or retro gaming, there\u2019s no end to what clever hands can create.\n\n"}

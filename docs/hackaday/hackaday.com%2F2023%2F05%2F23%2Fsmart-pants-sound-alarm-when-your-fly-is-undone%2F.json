Even moreso when you realize its been that way since you returned from the bathroom an hour ago. [Guy Dupont] has built a device to solve this awkward issue once and for all. (Nitter)\nPictured: The Hall effect sensor and magnet attached to the zipper.\nThe pants contain a Hall effect sensor which has been attached inside the fly of the jeans, at the bottom of the zipper. The zipper pull itself was then fitted with a strong magnet, which triggers the sensor when the zipper is in the open position. An ESP32 in the pocket of the jeans is tasked with monitoring the sensor. If it detects that the zipper has been down for too long, it sends a notification to the wearers smartphone to zip up. We kind of wish theyd sound an ear-splitting klaxon, but that might draw undesired attention to the wearer.\nZipper position monitoring seems like a nightmare at first, but [Guy]s hack shows us that its actually trivial with this method. The system does, however, add significant complication to what was previously a totally-analog pair of pants. Dont expect Big Jeans to jump on this tech, as maintenance and waterproofing issues would likely make the hardware a pain to deal with in real life.\nPlus, just imagine the frustration every morning. Sorry, mate, not ready to head out yet  Ive gotta pair my jeans with my smartphone.\n\n\nIf you know me, you know one of my favorite things to do is speedrun product ideas from my friends.

Back in the 1990s the answer might have included a now-forgotten contender, because in that decade Toshiba made a range of legendarily tough chunky grey machines. Of these the smallest was the Libretto, a paperback book sized clamshell design which was an object of desire. Its one of these that [Roberts Retro] has upgraded to use USB-C power instead of the original power brick.\nThe full video is below the break, and while it first deals with replacing a defective screen, the power part starts just before 22 minutes in. As youd expect it involves a USP-C PD trigger board, this time at 15 volts. Its mounted in a small 3D printed adapter to fill the space of the original jack, and requires a tiny notch be removed from the corner of its PCB to fit round the motherboard. The rest of the video deals with reassembling the machine and tending to mishaps with the ageing plastic, but the result is a Libretto with a modern charging port.\nNaturally a machine with a Pentium CPU and 32 megabytes of RAM is in of limited use in modern terms, but these Librettos remain very well-designed tiny PCs to this day. Its great to see them still being modified and upgraded, even if perhaps theres a limit to how far you can push their computing power. Weve encountered the Libretto before a few times, such as when one was used to retrieve data from an old Flash card.\n\n", "title": "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ec\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\uff1a\u6771\u829d\u306eLibretto", "body": "2020\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u3001Framework\u3084ThinkPad\u306a\u3069\u5019\u88dc\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u30021990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u306f\u3001Toshiba\u304c\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044Legretto\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3002\u4eca\u3067\u306fUSB-C\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ec\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c0\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\uff1a\u6771\u829d\u306eLibretto", "USB-C\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u6771\u829d\u306eLibretto\u5fa9\u6d3b", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1aLibretto\u306bUSB-C\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u6771\u829dLibretto\u306e\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u5316\u6539\u9020", "\u30da\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e0CPU\u642d\u8f09\uff1aLibretto\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b"]}

If you wanted something cooler and more personal, you could try building something like [Rick] did.\nA Raspberry Pi 400 is the basis for the machine, and it still uses the original keyboard. Its paired with a 3D-printed shell with a 7 Waveshare HDMI touch display in it. The LCD is placed behind a Fresnel lens which provides some magnification. It displays a glowing blue command line which accepts text commands. Its hooked up to the OpenAI API, so its a little smarter than just any old regular terminal. Its hooked up to [Ricks] home automation system, so he can use natural language queries to control lighting, music, and all the rest. Think Alexa or Siri, but in text form.\nThe design of the case, with its rounded edges, vents, and thick bezels gives it a strong retro-futuristic look, reminiscent of something out of Fallout. [Ricks] neat application of weathering techniques helped a lot, too.\nIt reminds us of some of the cooler Pip Boy builds weve seen. Meanwhile, if youve got your own creative terminal build in the works, dont hesitate to drop us a line!"}

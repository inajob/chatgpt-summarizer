This seems to just egg people on to reproduce it using other technologies than the optical pickup system the original device uses. [John Crombie] had a crack at building one using linear Hall effect sensors and magnets as the detection mechanism to good  well  effect.\nUsing the SS49E linear Hall effect sensor in pairs on four sides of a square, the setup proves quite straightforward. Above the fixed sensor plate is a moveable magnet plate centred by a set of springs.\u00a0 The magnets are aligned equidistant between each sensor pair such that each sensor will report an equal mid-range signal with zero mechanical displacement. With some simple maths, inputs due to displacements in-plane (i.e., left-right or up-down) can be resolved by looking at how pairs compare to each other. Rotations around the vertical axis are also determined in this manner.\nTilting inputs or vertical movements are resolved by looking at the absolute values of groups or all sensors. You can read more about this by looking at the projects GitHub page, which also shows how the to assemble the device, with all the CAD sources for those who want to modify it. Theres also a detour to using 3D-printed flexures instead of springs, although that has yet to prove functional.\nOn the electronics and interfacing side of things, [John] utilises the Arduino pro micro for its copious analog inputs and USB functionality. A nice feature of this board is that its based on the ATMega32U4, which can quickly implement USB client devices, such as game controllers, keyboards, and mice. The USB controller has been tweaked by adjusting the USB PID and VID values to identify it as a SpaceMouse Pro Wireless operating in cabled mode. This tricks the 3DConnexion drivers, allowing all the integrations into CAD tools to work out of the box.\nWe do like Space Mouse projects. Heres a fun one from last year, an\u00a0interesting one using PCB coils and flexures, and a simple hack to interface an old serial-connected unit.\n\n"}

Their lovely child comes up, having seen a celebrity rocking out with a funny $20 toy from the 80s, and asks for it. Of course, you reply, its just 20 dollars. However, a quick scan through eBay reveals that everyone elses kid has also been asking for this obscure toy for a school event, which now costs around $700. [Ben] found himself in that exact position and made a crucial off-hand comment, I bet I could make one of those. That was how his hectic journey into the world of toy reproduction began.\nAll [Ben] had for reference when recreating a Sax-A-Boom were pictures and sound clips. Modeling complex sweeping shapes in CAD is difficult, and [Ben] commissioned a 3d model from a professional on Fiverr. [Ben] broke down the model into printable sections and tweaked it to account for buttons. After a concerning amount of putty, wet sanding, and elbow grease, [Ben] had a decently smooth body for an instrument. The devices guts is an ESP32-based board called Sonatino, built around music generation. The music samples came from a virtual instrument clone on GitHub and loaded onto an SD card.\nTime pressure crept in towards the end, and [Ben] had to go for some dirty solution that he would have preferred (popsicle sticks and epoxy for button mounting). Yes, there were some gaps and paint flaws, but ultimately [Bens] son rocked the school presentation. Its a beautiful journey through creating something with a high level of finish on a limited timescale.\nPerhaps future versions of the Sax-A-Boom can take it further by adding a breath sensor, like this 3d printed MIDI instrument.\n\n", "title": "\"80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u73a9\u5177\u3092700\u30c9\u30eb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u8cb7\u3046\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u306a\u3044\uff1f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "body": "\u89aa\u305f\u3061\u306f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306b\u5b50\u4f9b\u306b\u683c\u5b89\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3042\u3052\u308b\u3068\u7d04\u675f\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5e02\u5834\u306b\u6d41\u901a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u30ec\u30a2\u306a\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u304c\u3061\u3002\u7236\u89aa\u3067\u3042\u308bBen\u306f\u606f\u5b50\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b800\u30c9\u30eb\u3059\u308bSax-A-Boom\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u97f3\u58f0\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3001\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u3064\u3084\u3084\u304b\u306a\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6ce8\u304e\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u6642\u9593\u3068\u52b4\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u606f\u5b50\u305f\u3061\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u8f1d\u304d\u3092\u653e\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u6539\u826f\u70b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001Sax-A-Boom\u306b\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\"80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u73a9\u5177\u3092700\u30c9\u30eb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u8cb7\u3046\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u306a\u3044\uff1f\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"Sax-A-Boom\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u3067\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff01\"", "\"\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6642\u9593\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\"", "\"3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3084ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u73a9\u5177\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"\u6b21\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u306f\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u3088\u3046\""]}

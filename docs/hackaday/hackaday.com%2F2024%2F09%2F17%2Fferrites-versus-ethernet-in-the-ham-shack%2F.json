Common wisdom says applying a few ferrite beads to things like Ethernet cables will help, but does that really work?\nIt surely appears to, for the most part at least, according to experiments done by [Ham Radio DX]. With a particular interest in lowering the noise floor for operations in the 2-meter band, his test setup consisted of a NanoVNA and a simple chunk of wire standing in for the twisted-pair conductors inside an Ethernet cable. The NanoVNA was set to sweep across the entire HF band and up into the VHF; various styles of ferrite were then added to the conductor and the frequency response observed. Simply clamping a single ferrite on the wire helped a little, with marginal improvement seen by adding one or two more ferrites. A much more dramatic improvement was seen by looping the conductor back through the ferrite for an additional turn, with diminishing returns at higher frequencies as more turns were added. The best performance seemed to come from two ferrites with two turns each, which gave 17 dB of suppression across the tested bandwidth.\nThe question then becomes: How do the ferrites affect Ethernet performance? [Ham Radio DX] tested that too, and it looks like good news there. Using a 30-meter-long Cat 5 cable and testing file transfer speed with iPerf, he found no measurable effect on throughput no matter what ferrites he added to the cable. In fact, some ferrites actually seemed to boost the file transfer speed slightly.\nFerrite beads for RFI suppression are nothing new, of course, but its nice to see a real-world test that tells you both how and where to apply them. The fact that you wont be borking your connection is nice to know, too. Then again, maybe its not your Ethernet thats causing the problem, in which case maybe youll need a little help from a thunderstorm to track down the issue.\n\n", "title": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u6ce2\u59a8\u5bb3\u3092\u4f4e\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u691c\u8a3c", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u306e\u6a5f\u6750\u3067\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u304c\u3001\u96fb\u6ce2\u59a8\u5bb3\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3068\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u6291\u5236\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u306f\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u5206\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u96fb\u6ce2\u59a8\u5bb3\u3092\u4f4e\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u691c\u8a3c", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u3088\u308b\u96fb\u6ce2\u5e72\u6e09\u306e\u4f4e\u6e1b\u5b9f\u9a13", "2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30d5\u30ed\u30a2\u4f4e\u6e1b\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u5b9f\u9a13", "Ethernet\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3078\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u691c\u8a3c", "RFI\u6291\u5236\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u4f7f\u7528\u6cd5"]}

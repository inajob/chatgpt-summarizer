Most RTSs, FPSs, and RPGs all control more or less the same way. But one type of controller that has fallen by the wayside is the paddle, or spinner. [jesster88] is a big Tempest\u00a0fan, however, and a spinner is crucial. Thus, what else is there to do but whip up ones own?\nTempest is one of the more difficult classic games to categorize.\nThe build is based around a wired optical mouse. Its pulled apart, with its main PCB installed into a 3D printed enclosure. Inside, the optical sensor is pointed at the base of a spinner constructed out of a printed drum and an off-the-shelf knob. The spinner is installed in a skateboard-style bearing for smooth rotation. As it spins, the optical sensor detects the motion and reports it as mouse movement via USB.\n[jesster88] uses the device for playing Tempest with MAME. We imagine the technique could be adapted to work with other games that rely on spinner or paddle inputs, too. Meanwhile, if youre whipping up your own retro game hacks at home, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

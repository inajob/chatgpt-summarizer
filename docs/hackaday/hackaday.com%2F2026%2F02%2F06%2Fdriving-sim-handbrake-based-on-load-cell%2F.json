Microsoft Flight Simulator, for example, can be played with a keyboard and mouse, a controller, or a huge, expensive simulator designed to replicate a specific airplane in every detail. Driving simulators are similar, and [CNCDan] has been hard at work on his DIY immersive driving sim rig, with this hand brake as his latest addition.\nFor this build, [CNCDan] is going with a lever-style handbrake which is common in motorsports like drifting and rallying. He has already built a set of custom pedals, so this design borrows heavily from them. That means that the sensor is a load cell, which takes input force from a lever connected to it with a spring mechanism. The signal is sent to an Arduino for processing, which is set up to send data over USB like any joystick or controller. In this case, hes using an Arduino that was already handling inputs from his custom shifter, so he only needed to use another input and add some code to get his handbrake added into his sim.\n[CNCDan] built a version of this out of laser-cut metal parts, but also has a fully 3D printable one available as well. Plenty of his other videos about his driving rig are available as well, from the pedal assembly we mentioned earlier to the force-feedback steering wheel. Its an impressive set of hardware with a feel that replicates racing about as faithfully as a simulator could. Interestingly, weve also seen this process in reverse as well where a real car was used instead as a video game controller.\n\n", "title": "- DIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30e0", "body": "\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002CNCDan\u306f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u30b7\u30e0\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30e0", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u9032\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u5bb6\u5ead\u3067\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306aDIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

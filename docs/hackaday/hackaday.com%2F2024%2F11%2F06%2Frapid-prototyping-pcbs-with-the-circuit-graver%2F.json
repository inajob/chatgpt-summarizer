The Circuit Graver by [Zach Fredin] is an unconventional PCB milling machine, utilizing many 3D printed parts, the familiar bed-slinger style Cartesian bot layout and a unique cutting head. The cutting tool, which started life as a tungsten carbide lathe tool, is held on a rotary (R) axis but can also move vertically via a flexure-loaded carriage driven by a 13 kg servo motor.\nThe stocky flexure took a lot of iteration, as the build logs will show. Despite a wild goose chase attempting to measure the cutting force, a complete machine solution was found by simply making everything stiff enough to prevent the tool from chattering across the surface of the FR4 blank. Controlling and maintaining the rake angle was a critical parameter here. [Zach] actually took an additional step, which we likely wouldnt have thought of, to have some copper blanks pre-fabricated to the required size and finished with an ENIG coating. Its definitely a smart move!\nTo allow the production of PCB-class feature sizes compatible with a traditional PCB router, the cutting tool was sharpened to a much smaller point than would be used in a lathe using a stone. This reduced the point size sufficiently to allow feature sizes down to 4 mils, or at least thats what initial characterization implied was viable.\u00a0 As you can see from the build logs, [Zach] has achieved a repeatable enough process to allow building a simple circuit using an SMT 74HC595 and some 0402 LEDs to create an SAO for this years Supercon badge. Neat stuff!\nWe see a fair few PCB mills, some 3D printed, and some not. Heres a nice one that fits in that former category. Milling PCBs is quite a good solution for the rapid prototyping of electronics. Heres a guide about that.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aPCB\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300cCircuit Graver\u300d", "body": "Hackaday Supercon 2024\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u305f\u300cCircuit Graver\u300d\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aPCB\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aPCB\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300cCircuit Graver\u300d", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300cCircuit Graver\u300d\u306e\u5207\u524a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "PCB\u88fd\u9020\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5b9f\u88c5", "\u30d5\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPCB\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u767a\u904e\u7a0b", "Supercon\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def\u69cb\u7bc9\u306b\u6311\u6226"]}

Luckily we arent limited to the old toner transfer trick for DIY boards these days, as CNC routers and powerful lasers can be used to etch boards quickly and accurately.\nBut theres still a problem  those methods leave you with a board that has exposed traces. That might work in a pinch for a one-off, but such boards are prone to shorts, and frankly just dont look very good. Which is why [Mikey Sklar] has been experimenting with applying both a soldermask and silkscreen to his homemade boards.\nThe process he describes starts after the board has already been etched. First he rolls on the soldermask, and then sandwiches the board between layers of transparency film and clear acrylic before curing it under a UV light. After two coats of the soldermask, the board goes into a fiber laser and the silkscreen and mask layers are loaded into the software and the machine is set to a relatively low power (here, 40%). The trick is that the mask layer is set to run four times versus the single run of the silkscreen, which ensures that the copper is fully exposed.\nSince the board doesnt need to be moved between operations, you dont have to worry about the registration being off. The end result really does look quite nice, with the silkscreen especially popping visually a lot more than we would have assumed.\nWeve previously covered how [Mikey] uses his CNC router and fiber laser to cut out and etch the boards, so this latest installment brings the whole thing full circle. The equipment youll need to follow along at home isnt cheap, but we cant argue with the final results.\n\n", "title": "- DIY\u57fa\u677f\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1aCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306aPCB\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3001DIY\u3067\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u88fd\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002Mikey Sklar\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u57fa\u677f\u306b\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u57fa\u677f\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1aCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u4e26\u307f\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u30b7\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5229\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u8fc5\u901f\u3067\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u57fa\u677f\u52a0\u5de5\uff1aUV\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "- \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u57fa\u677f\u6280\u8853", "- Mikey Sklar\u306e\u57fa\u677f\u52a0\u5de5\u30e1\u30bd\u30c3\u30c9\uff1a\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u3082\u826f\u597d\u306a\u5b8c\u6210\u54c1\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059"]}

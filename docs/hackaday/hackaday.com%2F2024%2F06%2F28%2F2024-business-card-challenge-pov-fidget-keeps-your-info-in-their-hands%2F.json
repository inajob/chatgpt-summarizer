People who needed to fidget all along still need something to do with their hands. So why not hand them a solution with your information on it?\nNot only will this spin nicely, the spinning action will use magnets to energize PCB coils and light up LEDs for some persistence of vision action. Designing the PCB was easier than you might imagine thanks to KiMotor, a KiCad plugin to automate the design of parametric PCB motors.\nMechanical testing went pretty well with the bearings and magnets that [mulcmu] had on hand, along with a scrap PCB as the sacrifice. Although a bit difficult to hold, it spins okay with just the bearing and the shaft. Once the boards arrived, it was time to test the electrical side. So far, things are not looking good  [mulcmu] is only getting a few tens of mV out of the rectifier  but they arent giving up hope yet. We cant wait to see this one in action!\nHurry! This is the last weekend to enter the 2024 Business Card Challenge! Technically you have until Tuesday, July 2nd, but you know what we mean. Show us what youve got!\n \n\n", "title": "2024\u5e74\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u624b\u56de\u3057\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u4ed8\u304d\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "2024\u5e74\u306b\u5165\u3063\u305f\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3001\u624b\u3067\u3044\u3058\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u9054\u304c\u307e\u3060\u4f55\u304b\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3002\u78c1\u77f3\u3067LED\u3092\u5149\u3089\u305b\u308b\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30b9\u30d4\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u4f5c\u696d\u3002KiMotor\u3084KiCad\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3067PCB\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u306f\u591a\u5c11\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u304c\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3067\u3042\u308b\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["2024\u5e74\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u624b\u56de\u3057\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u4ed8\u304d\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "KiCad\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3KiMotor\u3067\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30afPCB\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u8a2d\u8a08", "PCB\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u6027\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30de\u30b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLED\u30b9\u30d4\u30ca\u30fc", "\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b82024\uff1a\u6700\u7d42\u9031\u672b\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3080\uff1a\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u3092\u51dd\u3089\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

[MXC Builds] saw an awesome lamp from [karacreates], but decided it would be better as a PC case.\nWe love seeing how different techniques can be used in conjunction to make something that no one method could produce on its own, and for this build, we see [MXC Builds] use 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC, sewing, soldering, and traditional woodworking techniques.\nA large part of the video is spent on the CNC process for the walnut base and power button enclosure for the build. As with any project, there are a few places requiring some creative use of the tools on hand, like the walnut piece for the base being too tall for the machines usual z-calibration puck or any of [MXC Builds]s bits to do in one pass, and its always interesting to see how other makers solve these issues.\nIf youre looking for other beautiful casemods, how about a transparent PS2 or this Art Deco number? Before you go, may we bend your ear about how PC Cases are Still Stuck in the Dark Ages?\n\n"}

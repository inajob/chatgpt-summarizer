Among them was [Vladimir Divic]s gradients game, software for an M5Stack module which was definitely a lot of fun to play. The idea of the game is simple enough, a procedurally generated contour map is displayed on the screen, and the player must navigate a red ball around and collect as many green ones as possible. Its navigated using the M5Stacks accelerometer, which is what makes for the engaging gameplay. In particular it takes a moment to discover that the ball can be given momentum, making it something more than a simple case of ball-rolling.\nUnderneath the hood its an Arduino .ino\u00a0 file for the M5Stacks ESP32, and thus shouldnt present a particular challenge to most readers. Meanwhile the M5Stack with its versatile range of peripherals has made it onto these pages several times over the years, not least as a LoRA gateway.", "title": "- M5Stack\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u30b0\u30e9\u30c7\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "body": "\u30d9\u30eb\u30ea\u30f3\u306eHackaday Europe\u3067\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308bM5Stack\u7528\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- M5Stack\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u30b0\u30e9\u30c7\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300d\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30a5\u30a4\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01M5Stack\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b7\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\uff1aM5Stack\u306e\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8a08\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "- M5Stack\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- Berlin Hackaday\u3067\u306eM5Stack\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

Such is the case with [Alex]s Salsa ONE minimalist game console, which is inspired by both the Arduboy and the ergonomics of the SanDisk Sansa music player.\nWith Salsa ONE, [Alex] aimed to make something that is both simple and challenging. The result is something that, awesomely enough, doesnt need a PCB, and can be comfortably controlled with just one thumb. There isnt much to this thing, which is essentially an RP2040, an OLED, a vibration motor, a buzzer, a button, and a CR2032 coin cell. [Alex] chose to program Salsa ONE in MicroPython. Be sure to check it out in action in the brief demo after the break.\nHave you got an idea for a tiny game? Dont hesitate to enter the 2024 Tiny Games Contest! You have until September 10th, so head on over to Hackaday.io and get started today.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30ebSalsa ONE\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "Tiny game console\u300cSalsa ONE\u300d\u306f\u3001Arduboy\u3068SanDisk Sansa\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u30011\u3064\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002RP2040\u3001OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3001\u632f\u52d5\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u30d6\u30b6\u30fc\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3001CR2032\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u578b\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u30022024 Tiny Games Contest\u3078\u306e\u53c2\u52a0\u3092\u52e7\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30ebSalsa ONE\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "Arduino\u3068SanDisk Sansa\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u6311\u6226\u7684\u306aSalsa ONE\u306e\u958b\u767a", "MicroPython\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3055\u308c\u305fSalsa ONE\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "2024 Tiny Games Contest\u3078\u306e\u53c2\u52a0\u3092\u3054\u691c\u8a0e\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044"]}

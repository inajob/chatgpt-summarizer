Such is the case with [Alex]s Salsa ONE minimalist game console, which is inspired by both the Arduboy and the ergonomics of the SanDisk Sansa music player.\nWith Salsa ONE, [Alex] aimed to make something that is both simple and challenging. The result is something that, awesomely enough, doesnt need a PCB, and can be comfortably controlled with just one thumb. There isnt much to this thing, which is essentially an RP2040, an OLED, a vibration motor, a buzzer, a button, and a CR2032 coin cell. [Alex] chose to program Salsa ONE in MicroPython. Be sure to check it out in action in the brief demo after the break.\nHave you got an idea for a tiny game? Dont hesitate to enter the 2024 Tiny Games Contest! You have until September 10th, so head on over to Hackaday.io and get started today.\n\n\n \n\n"}

Many modern keyboards have USB functionality in this regard, and there are all kinds of pads and gadgets that will spit out MIDI, too. But you might also like to build your own, like this touchscreen design from [Nick Culbertson].\nThe build takes advantage of a device colloquially called the Cheap Yellow Display. It consists of a 320 x 240 TFT touchscreen combined with a built-in ESP32-WROOM-32, available under the part number ESP32-2432S028R.\n\n[Nick] took this all-in-one device and turned it into a versatile MIDI controller platform. It spits out MIDI data over Bluetooth and has lots of fun modes. Theres a straightforward keyboard, which works just like youd expect, and a nifty beat sequencer too. There are more creative ideas, too, like the bouncing-ball Zen mode, a physics-based note generator, and an RNG mode. If you liked Electroplankton on the Nintendo DS, youd probably dig some of these. Files are on GitHub if you want to replicate the build.\nThese days, off-the-shelf hardware is super capable, so you can whip up a simple MIDI controller\u00a0really quickly.

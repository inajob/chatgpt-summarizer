But it used to be you pretty much had to build your own receiver which, luckily, wasnt as hard as building your own VHF or UHF gear. But there is a problem. These low frequencies have a very long wavelength and, thus, need very large antennas to get any reception. [Electronics Unmessed] says he has an answer.\nThese days, if you want to explore any part of the radio spectrum, you can probably do it easily with a software-defined radio (SDR). But the antenna is the key part that you are probably lacking. A small antenna will not work well at all. While the video covers a fairly common idea: using a loop antenna, his approach to loops is a bit different using a matching transformer, and he backs his thoughts up with modeling and practical results.\nOf course, transformers also introduce loss, but  as always  everything is a trade-off. Running hundreds of feet of wire in your yard or even in a loop is not always a possibility. This antenna looks like it provides good performance and it would be simple to duplicate.\nEarly radio was VLF. Turns out, VLF may provide an unexpected public service in space.\n\n", "title": "- VLF\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "body": "VLF\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u96c6\u307e\u308b\u4e2d\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- VLF\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\uff08SDR\uff09\u3067\u306e\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u53d7\u4fe1\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30aa\u30d5", "- VLF\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u610f\u5916\u306a\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u5229\u7528\u4fa1\u5024"]}

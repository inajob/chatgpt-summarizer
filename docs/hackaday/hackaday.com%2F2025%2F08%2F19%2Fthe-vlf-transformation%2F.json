But it used to be you pretty much had to build your own receiver which, luckily, wasnt as hard as building your own VHF or UHF gear. But there is a problem. These low frequencies have a very long wavelength and, thus, need very large antennas to get any reception. [Electronics Unmessed] says he has an answer.\nThese days, if you want to explore any part of the radio spectrum, you can probably do it easily with a software-defined radio (SDR). But the antenna is the key part that you are probably lacking. A small antenna will not work well at all. While the video covers a fairly common idea: using a loop antenna, his approach to loops is a bit different using a matching transformer, and he backs his thoughts up with modeling and practical results.\nOf course, transformers also introduce loss, but  as always  everything is a trade-off. Running hundreds of feet of wire in your yard or even in a loop is not always a possibility. This antenna looks like it provides good performance and it would be simple to duplicate.\nEarly radio was VLF. Turns out, VLF may provide an unexpected public service in space.\n\n"}

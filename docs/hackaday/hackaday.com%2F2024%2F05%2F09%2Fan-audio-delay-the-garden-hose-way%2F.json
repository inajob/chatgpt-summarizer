One such is the delay; digital delays are now a staple of any production software where once they required infrastructure. [Look Mum No Computer] is no stranger to the world of Lo-Fi analogue music making, and along with his musical collaborator [Hainback], hes created an analogue delay from an unexpected material: garden hose pipe.\nThe unit takes inspiration from some commercial 1970s effects, and lends a fixed short delay intended to give a double-tracking effect to vocals or similar. It involves putting a speaker at one end of a reel of hose and a microphone at the other, while the original unexpectedly used Shure SM57 capsules as both speaker and microphone they use a very small loudspeaker and a cheap microphone capsule.\nThe sound is not what youd call high quality. Indeed, its about what one might expect when listening down a long pipe. But when mixed in behind the vocals, it gives a very pleasing effect. The duo use it on their new EP which, as you might expect, is released on vinyl.\nIf such effects interest you, also take a look at a 1950s reverb room at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.\n\n", "title": "DIY Analog Delay: \u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u4f5c\u308b", "body": "2024\u5e74\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306f\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u304a\u304b\u3052\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002[Look Mum No Computer]\u3068[Hainback]\u306f\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u8cea\u306f\u52a3\u308b\u304c\u30dc\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u306b\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY Analog Delay: \u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u4f5c\u308b", "\u30ed\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064: Look Mum No Computer\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u52b9\u679c: \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30ed\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8: \u30dc\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u306b\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u52b9\u679c\u3092", "\u30a2\u30d3\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u306e1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u6311\u6226"]}

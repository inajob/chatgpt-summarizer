Separating a part into multiple pieces is usually done to split up objects that are too big to fit on the 3D printers print bed. But [Peter] at Markforged (manufacturers of high-end 3D printers) has a video explaining another reason: multi-part prints can benefit from improved strength.\nThis part can be easily printed as a single piece, but it can be made nearly twice as strong when printed as two, and combined.\nThe idea is this: filament-based 3D printers generally create parts that are strongest along their X-Y axis (relative to their manufacture) and weakest in the Z direction. [Peter] proposes splitting a part into pieces with this in mind. Not because the part is inconveniently large or has tricky geometry, but so the individual pieces can be printed in orientations that provide the best mechanical strength.\nThis is demonstrated with the simple part shown here.\u00a0The usual way to print this part would be flat on a print bed, but by splitting the parts into two and printing each in their optimal orientation, the combined part withstands nearly twice as much force before failing.\n[Peter]s examples use Markforgeds own filaments, but gives advice on more common polymers as well and the same principles apply. This idea is one worth keeping in mind the next time one is seeking to optimize strength. because of how simple it is.\nWeve seen a variety of methods to toughen up or ruggedize prints in the past, but theyre usually more complex (or at least messier.) Examples include embedding braided steel cable, embedding fiberglass mesh, applying electroplating to a printed structure, and plain old embedding some bolts and washers to buffer load-bearing areas.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u8907\u6570\u306b\u5206\u5272\u3057\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002X-Y\u8ef8\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u306f\u5f37\u304f\u3001Z\u8ef8\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u306f\u5f31\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u6700\u9069\u306a\u65b9\u5411\u3067\u5404\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306f2\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u529b\u306b\u8010\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u3088\u308a\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u5358\u4e00\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4e8c\u3064\u306b\u5206\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "2\u3064\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u8a3c", "\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6700\u9069\u306a\u65b9\u5411\u3067\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5f37\u5ea6\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

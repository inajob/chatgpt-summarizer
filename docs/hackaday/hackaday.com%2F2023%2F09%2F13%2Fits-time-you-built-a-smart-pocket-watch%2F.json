Or are they? [JGJMatt] proves otherwise with their stunning DIY smart pocket watch. It is essentially a cheap smart watch from Amazon stuffed into the shell of an old pocket watch, but you know its not quite that simple.\nOn the easier side of things, [JGJMatt] had to come up with a 3D-printed bracket to hold the smart watchs guts. On the harder end of the spectrum, he ended up building the charging port into the crown, where the latch used to be.\nThis is a beautiful build for sure, and a great way to reuse something that might otherwise end up thrown away or melted down.\nLooking for a cool alternative pocket watch thats a little easier to build? Check out [JGJMatt]s pocket sundial."}

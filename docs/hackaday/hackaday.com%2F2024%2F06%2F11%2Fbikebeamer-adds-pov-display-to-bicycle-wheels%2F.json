Generally, simple flashing LEDs for both the front and the rear is a pretty good start, but it doesnt hurt to add a few more lights to the bicycle or increase their brightness. On the other hand, if you want to add some style to your bicycle lighting system then this persistence of vision (POV) display called the BikeBeamer from [locxter] might be just the thing.\nThe display uses four LED strips, each housed in their own 3D printed case which are installed at 90-degree angles from one another in between the spokes of a standard bicycle wheel. An ESP32 sits at the base of one of the strips and is responsible for storing the image and directing the four displays. This is a little more complex than a standard POV display as its also capable of keeping up with the changing rotational speeds of the bicycle wheels when in use. The design also incorporates batteries so that no wires need to route from the bike frame to the spinning wheels.\nThis is an ongoing project for [locxter] as well, meaning that there are some planned upgrades even to this model that should be in the pipe for the future. Improving the efficiency of the code will hopefully allow for more complex images and even animations to be displayed in the future, and there are also some plans to improve the PCB as well with all surface-mount components. There are a few other ways to upgrade your bikes lighting as well, and we could recommend this heads-up headlight display to get started.", "title": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u7528\u306eLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046", "body": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u7167\u660e\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002LED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3084BikeBeamer\u306a\u3069\u306ePOV\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u3088\u308a\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u4e88\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u7528\u306eLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046", "\u30d1\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9\u30aa\u30d6\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff08POV\uff09\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3088\u3046", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306ePOV\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3088\u3046", "BikeBeamer: \u56de\u8ee2\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306bLED\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3088\u3046", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u7528\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

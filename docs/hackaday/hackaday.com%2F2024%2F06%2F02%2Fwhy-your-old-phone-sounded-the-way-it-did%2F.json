At [This Museum Is Not Obsolete] they have a fully functional mechanical telephone exchange as one of their exhibits, and theyve published a video examining the various sounds its capable of making.\nWhen a voice synthesiser was the stuff of science fiction, exchange status couldnt be communicated by anything but a set of different tones. If youve ever encountered a mechanical exchange youll recognise the harsh-sounding low-frequency dial tone, and the various sets of beeps denoting different call status. These were produced with a set of oscillators being switched in and out by shaped cams, and the bank of these on their exchange is most of the subject of this video. The common ones such as the engaged tone and the dial tone are explained, but also some wed never heard such as the one signifying the exchange as out of capacity.\nWe may never own a mechanical exchange of our own, but were glad that someone does and is sharing it with us. You can see the video below the break.\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "body": "\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u304c\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u6709\u7dda\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306f\u5909\u308f\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002[This Museum Is Not Obsolete] \u3067\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u304c\u5c55\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u97f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u97f3\uff1a\u305d\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u9b45\u529b", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\uff1a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853", "\u97f3\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u96fb\u8a71\u4ea4\u63db\u6a5f\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\uff1a\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u4e00\u7aef"]}

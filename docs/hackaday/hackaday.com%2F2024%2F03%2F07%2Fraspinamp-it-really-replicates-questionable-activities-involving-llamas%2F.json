To avoid tragedies like Windows Media Center, plenty of us switched to Winamp instead, a much more customizable piece of software that helped pave the way for the digital music revolution of that era. Although there are new, official versions of Winamp currently available, nothing really tops the nostalgia of the original few releases of the software which this project faithfully replicates in handheld form.\nThe handheld music player uses a standard Raspberry Pi (in this case, a 3B) and a 3.5 TFT touchscreen display, all enclosed in a clear plastic case. With all of the Pi configuration out of the way, including getting the touchscreen working properly, the software can be set up. It uses QMMP as a media player with a Winamp skin since QMMP works well on Linux systems with limited resources. After getting it installed theres still some configuration to do to get the Pi to start it at boot and also to fit the player perfectly into the confines of the screen without any of the desktop showing around the edges.\nAlthough it doesnt use the original Winamp software directly, as that would involve a number of compatibility layers and/or legacy hardware at this point, we still think its a faithful recreation of how the original looked and felt on our Windows 98 machines. With a battery and a sizable SD card, this could have been the portable MP3 player many of us never knew we wanted until the iPod came out in the early 00s, and would certainly still work today for those of us not chained to a streaming service. A Raspberry Pi is not the only platform that can replicate the Winamp experience, though. This player does a similar job with the PyPortal instead.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fWinamp\u98a8\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u306bMP3\u3084\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u5171\u6709\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u4ed8\u5c5e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30c7\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3088\u308a\u3082\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002Winamp\u306f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u306e\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fWinamp\u98a8\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\uff01Winamp\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305fRaspberry Pi\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u97f3\u697d\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308aWinamp\u98a8\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc", "\u97f3\u697d\u9769\u547d\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\uff1a90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eWinamp\u3092Raspberry Pi\u3067\u518d\u73fe", "\u30d1\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01PyPortal\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWinamp\u98a8\u97f3\u697d\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc"]}

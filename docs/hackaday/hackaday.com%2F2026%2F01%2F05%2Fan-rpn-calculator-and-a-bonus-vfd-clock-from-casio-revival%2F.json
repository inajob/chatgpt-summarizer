It seems to originate in the permaculture movement, but it can apply equally well to electronics. Take the problem [shiura] had: a Casio Mini CM-602 that had let out the magic smoke. The solution was a twofer: rebuild the Casio into a modern number cruncher with Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), and save the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) for a gorgeous WiFi clock.\n[shiura]s write-up includes a helpful guide for reverse engineering the pins on this sort of VFD, if you dont happen to have the same model calculator (or VFD tube) theyre working with. If youve done this sort of thing, you know what to expect: power it up and kill power to the pins, one by one, to map out which segments or characters go out, thereby identifying the anodes and grid electrodes. The cathodes had already been IDd from looking at the PCB. After that its just a matter of wiring the VFD to an ESP32 via a transistor array to get the voltages right, and voila! Clock. The code and case design files for this clock  including an editable .blend  are available via GitHub.\nThe calculator half of the project is an incredibly elegant hack that relies on the fact that the Casios CPU has the same pin pitch as modern micros: 2.54 mm, or 0.1, so an RP2040 zero can sit in the footprint of the original CPU, scanning the keypads with its GPIO. Then an I2C display is separately wired up to replace the clockified VFD. Perhaps some driver circuitry for the VFD died, or [shiura] salvaged the display before deciding to save the calculator, because otherwise we see no reason why this brain transplant couldnt be done while keeping the original display. Admittedly having two lines on the display instead of one make the new calculator a tad more usable. The code for that is also available on GitHub, and while the readme is in Japanese, machine translations have gotten pretty good and the code is quite readable on its own.\nLongtime readers will likely be familiar with [shiura]s work, with a number of finely crafted clocks having been featured from the Japanese maker, along with vintage pocket computer repairs. Bringing both together makes this twin hack particularly on-brand.\n\n\n"}

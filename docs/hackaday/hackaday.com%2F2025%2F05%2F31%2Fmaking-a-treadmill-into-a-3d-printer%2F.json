It allows prints to be shifted out of the build volume as printing continues, greatly increasing the size and flexibility of what you can print. But [Ivan Miranda] and [J\u00f3n Schone] had a question. Instead of making a treadmill to suit a 3D printer, what if you just built a 3D printer on top of a full-size treadmill?\nThe duo sourced a piece of real gym equipment for this build. They then set about building a large-scale 3D printer on top of this platform. The linear rails were first mounted on to the treadmills frame, followed by a gantry for the print head itself and mounts for the necessary stepper motors. The printer also gained a custom extra-large extruder to ensure a satisfactory print speed that was suitable for the scale of the machine. From there, it was largely a case of fitting modules and running cables to complete the printer.\nSoon enough, the machine was printing hot plastic on the treadmill surface, thereby greatly expanding the usable print volume. Its a little tricky to wrap your head around at first, but when you see it in action, its easy to see the utility of a build like this, particularly at large scale. [Ivan] demonstrated this by printing a massive girder over two meters long.\nWe started seeing attempts at building a belt-equipped infinite build volume printer back in 2017, and it took awhile before the concept matured enough to be practical. Even today, they remain fairly uncommon.\n\n"}

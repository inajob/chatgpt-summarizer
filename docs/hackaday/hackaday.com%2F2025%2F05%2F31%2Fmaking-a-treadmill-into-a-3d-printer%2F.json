It allows prints to be shifted out of the build volume as printing continues, greatly increasing the size and flexibility of what you can print. But [Ivan Miranda] and [J\u00f3n Schone] had a question. Instead of making a treadmill to suit a 3D printer, what if you just built a 3D printer on top of a full-size treadmill?\nThe duo sourced a piece of real gym equipment for this build. They then set about building a large-scale 3D printer on top of this platform. The linear rails were first mounted on to the treadmills frame, followed by a gantry for the print head itself and mounts for the necessary stepper motors. The printer also gained a custom extra-large extruder to ensure a satisfactory print speed that was suitable for the scale of the machine. From there, it was largely a case of fitting modules and running cables to complete the printer.\nSoon enough, the machine was printing hot plastic on the treadmill surface, thereby greatly expanding the usable print volume. Its a little tricky to wrap your head around at first, but when you see it in action, its easy to see the utility of a build like this, particularly at large scale. [Ivan] demonstrated this by printing a massive girder over two meters long.\nWe started seeing attempts at building a belt-equipped infinite build volume printer back in 2017, and it took awhile before the concept matured enough to be practical. Even today, they remain fairly uncommon.\n\n", "title": "\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5927\u578b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63d0\u6848", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u306e\u4e0a\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u5927\u578b\u5370\u5237\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5927\u578b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63d0\u6848", "\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u4e0a\u306b\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf", "\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u305f\u5370\u5237\u4f53\u9a13\uff01\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u5f0f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u5927\u578b\u69cb\u9020\u7269\u3082\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b", "\u7121\u9650\u5370\u5237\u5bb9\u91cf\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30df\u30eb\u6d3b\u7528\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u9032\u5c55"]}

This is ErgO, a smart ring you can build out of a few commonly available breakouts, and it keeps a large number of features within a fingers reach. The project has got an IMU, a Pimoroni trackball, and a good few buttons to perform actions or switch modes, and its powered by a tiny Bluetooth-enabled devboard so it can seamlessly perform HID device duty.\nWhile the hardware itself appears to be in a relatively early state, theres no shortage of features, and the whole experience looks quite polished. Want to lay back in your chair yet keep scrolling the web, clicking through links as you go? This ring lets you do that, no need to hold your mouse anymore, and you can even use it while exercising. Want to do some quick text editing on the fly? Thats also available; the ErgO is designed to be used for day to day tasks, and the UX is thought out well. Want to use it with more than just your computer? There is a device switching feature. The build instructions are quite respectable, too  you can absolutely build one like this yourself, just get a few breakouts, a small battery, some 3D printed parts, and find an evening to solder them all together. All code is on GitHub, just like you would expect from a hack well done.\nLooking for a different sort of ring? Weve recently featured a hackable cheap smart ring usable for fitness tracking  this one is a product thats still being reverse-engineered, but its alright if youre okay with only having an accelerometer and a few optical sensors.\n\n", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u300cErgO\u300d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "ErgO\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3001IMU\u3084Pimoroni\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3001Bluetooth\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u4f5c\u696d\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001GitHub\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u300cErgO\u300d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u300cErgO\u300d", "ErgO\uff1a \u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f53\u9a13\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u7de8\u96c6", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u300cErgO\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

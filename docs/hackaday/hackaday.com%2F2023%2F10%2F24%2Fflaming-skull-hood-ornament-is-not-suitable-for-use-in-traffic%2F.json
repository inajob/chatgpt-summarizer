Really, though, a good hood skull should breathe fire to truly inspire enmity or awe. Thankfully, when [Anthony] went about modifying his ex-school bus, he was sure to equip it with suitably flaming equipment. Its dangerous, so dont try this one at home and melt your car, you hear?\nThe build started with an off-the-shelf replica cow skull, in lovely flame-resistant metal. It was then plumbed with a propane feed that could be triggered by a 12-volt solenoid. This was combined with a high-voltage coil driving a grill igniter to provide the necessary initiating spark.\nTo go forth with flames, first, a missile switch must be flipped up and engaged to arm the system. Then, hitting the skull-and-crossbones button will send fire surging forth from the front of the vehicle. Alternatively, a wireless keyfob can be used, which bypasses the arming system\u2014so leaving the remote in a pocket is ill-advised.\nAmazingly, a former project posted on Hackaday served as an inspiration for this build. Video after the break.\n\n"}

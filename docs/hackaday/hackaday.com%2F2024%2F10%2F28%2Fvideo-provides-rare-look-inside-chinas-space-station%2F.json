Thats essentially what we know about the orbital complex here in the West, as China tends to be fairly secretive when it comes to their activities in space.\nBut thanks to a recently released video by the state-funded CCTV Video News Agency, we now have an unprecedented look inside of humanitys newest orbital laboratory. Shenzhou-18 crew members [Ye Guangfu], [Li Cong], and [Li Guangsu] provide viewers with a full-blown tour of the station, and theres even baked-in English subtitles so you wont miss a beat.\nThe few looks the public has gotten inside of Tiangong in the past have been low-resolution and generally of the shaky cam variety. In comparison, this flashy presentation was clearly made to impress an international audience. But lets be fair, if you managed to build your own crewed station in low Earth orbit, wouldnt you want to show it off a bit?\nCrew berths on Tiangong appear considerably more comfortable than those on the ISS.\nSo what did we learn about Tiangong from this tour? Well, admittedly not more than we could have guessed. The layout of the three-module station isnt entirely unlike the International Space Station or even its Soviet predecessor, Mir.\nOne module contains a common area where the crew meets and eats their meals, as well as the sleeping berths for crew members. (The small portholes in each berth are a nice touch.) Then there are the multi-purpose laboratory modules with their rows of rack mounted experiments, an exercise area, and finally an airlock that can be used to either bring cargo onboard or expose experiments to space.\nEven though its much smaller than the ISS, one cant help but notice that the inside of the Tiangong appears a bit less cramped. The modules of the Chinese station have a slightly sleeker internal look, and overall, everything seems less cluttered, or at least, better organized. Some online commenters have equated it to the comparison between the SpaceX Dragon and Russias Soyuz capsule, which given the relative ages of the two stations, isnt wholly inaccurate.\nChinas space program has been making great strides over the last several years, but from an outsiders perspective, its been difficult to follow. Its been doubly frustrating for us here at Hackaday. Wed love to provide the same sort of in-depth coverage we do for American and European missions, but often its a challenge to find the technical data that requires. Heres hoping this video means China is looking to be more transparent about their off-world activities going forward.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300c\u5929\u5bae\u300d\u5185\u90e8\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u516c\u958b", "body": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300c\u5929\u5bae\u300d\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u306a\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300c\u5929\u5bae\u300d\u5185\u90e8\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u516c\u958b", "- \u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6-18\u53f7\u306e\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u304c\u6848\u5185\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b9f\u9a13\u5ba4", "- \u5929\u5bae\u306e\u5feb\u9069\u3055\uff1a\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u958b\u767a\u9032\u5c55\u3068\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3078\u306e\u671f\u5f85", "- \u6700\u65b0\u6620\u50cf\u3067\u898b\u308b\u5929\u5bae\u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3068\u8a2d\u5099\u5185\u5bb9"]}

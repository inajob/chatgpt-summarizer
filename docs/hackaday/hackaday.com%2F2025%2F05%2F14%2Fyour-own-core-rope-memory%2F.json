But there was a time when that wasnt feasible. [Igor Brichkov] shows us how to make a core rope memory using a set of ferrite cores and wire. This was famously used in early UNIVAC computers and the Apollo guidance computer. You can see how it works in the video below.\nWhile rope memory superficially resembles core memory, the principle of operation is different. In core memory, the cores magnetization is what determines any given bit. For rope memory, the cores are more like a sensing element. A set wire tries to flip the polarity of all cores. An inhibit signal stops that from happening except on the cores you want to read. Finally, a sense wire weaves through the cores and detects a blip when a core changes polarity. The second video, below, is an old MIT video that explains how it works (about 20 minutes in).\nWhy not just use core memory? Density. These memories could store much more data than a core memory system in the same volume. Of course, you could write to core memory, too, but thats not always a requirement.\nWeve seen a resurgence of core rope projects lately. Regular old core is fun, too.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u5178\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30b3\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b3\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u521d\u671f\u306eUNIVAC\u3084\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u5178\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30b3\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u521d\u671f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u898b\u308b\u30b3\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u30d5\u30a7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b3\u30a2\u3068\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea", "- \u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044\uff1a\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u5b58\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

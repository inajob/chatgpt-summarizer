[Andrew Taylor], part of the team that built the original,\u00a0 has built a series of virtual domino puzzles to help explain how the computer worked. He also links to a video from the event, but be warned: the video contains some spoilers for the puzzles. If you are ready for spoilers, you can watch the video below.\nThe original computer could add two three-bit numbers and provide a four-bit result. We dont want to give away the answers, but the inverter is quite strange. If you dont want to puzzle it out, you can press the reveal answer to see [Andrews] solutions. Press play and watch the dominos fall.\n\nOf course, building an adder is a far cry from building a computer, but at 10,000 dominos, a real computer would be difficult, though clearly possible. This is especially true when you consider that these logic gates can only run once, so testing is a bear. The fact that knocking over a domino takes it out of play is exactly how many of the gates work, too, but thats the only hint well give.\nWe couldnt help but think of the Three Body Problems human computer. If you prefer your domino logic to be non-interactive, weve covered another presentation on the topic.\n"}

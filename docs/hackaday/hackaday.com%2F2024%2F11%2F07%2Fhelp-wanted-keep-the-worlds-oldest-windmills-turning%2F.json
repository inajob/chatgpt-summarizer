More surprisingly, some of them are still turning after 1,000 years.\nThe ancient world holds many wonders of technology, and some are only now coming back to the surface like the Antikythera Mechanism. Milling grain with wind power probably started around the 8th Century in Persia, but in Nashtifan, Iran theyve been keeping the mills running generation-to-generation for over 1000 years. [Mohammed Etebari], the last windmill keeper is in need of an apprentice to keep them running though.\nIn a world where vertical axis wind turbines seem like a new-fangled fad, its interesting to see these panemone windmills are actually the original recipe. The high winds of the region mean that the timber and clay structure of the asbad structure housing the turbine is sufficient for their task without all the fabric or man-made composites of more modern designs. While drag-type turbines arent particularly efficient, we do wonder how some of the lessons of repairability might be used to enhance the longevity of modern wind turbines. Getting even 100 years out of a turbine would be some wicked ROI.\nWooden towers arent just a thing of the past either, with new wooden wind turbines soaring 100 m into the sky. Since youll probably be wanting to generate electricity and not mill grain if you made your own, how does that work anyway?\n\n"}

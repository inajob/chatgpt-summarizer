New models can be so advanced that their export and use is heavily controlled by certain countries, including the USA. If you just want to tinker at the low end, though, you dont have to spend a lot of scratch. You can even build yourself something simple based on an Arduino Uno!\nThe build uses Panasonics cheap Grid-EYE infrared array as the thermal sensor, in this case, a model with an 88 array of thermopiles. Its not going to get you any fancy images, especially at long range, but you can use it to get a very blocky kind of Predator-vision of the thermal radiation environment. Its a simple matter of hooking up the Grid-EYE sensor to the Arduino Uno over I2C, and then spitting out the sensors data in a nice visual form on a cheap TFT screen.\nIts a great introduction to the world of thermal imaging. Theres no better way to learn how something works by building a working example yourself. Weve featured a few similar projects before, too; its all thanks to the fact that thermal sensors are getting cheaper and more accessible than ever!"}

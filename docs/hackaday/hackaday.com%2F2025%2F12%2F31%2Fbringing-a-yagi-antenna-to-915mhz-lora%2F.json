LoRa is a great, low-power radio communications standards, but sometimes the antennas you get with the modules can leave you wanting more. Thats why [Chris Prioli] at the Gloucester County Amateur Radio Club in the great state of New Jersey have got a Yagi antenna for North Americas 915 MHz LoRa band.\nRight out the gate, their article links to one of ours, where [tastes_the_code] builds a Yagi antenna for the European 868 MHz LoRa. Like [tastes_the_code], the radio club found [Chris]s antenna gives much better reception than what came with the LoRa module. Looking out their window, instead of two Metastatic nodes with a stock antenna, one club member is now connecting to two hundred.\nA simulation of the radiation pattern. Looks like a Yagi, alright.\nNow, the Yagi is directional, so you only get that boost pointed down the axis of the antenna, but at least in simulation they estimate a 7.7 dB front-to-back gain vs under 3 dB for an omnidirectional antenna. Not bad, for a simple 3D print and some stiff wire!\nIf you dont want to re-invent the wheel again, check out the GCARCs GitHub for files if youre in North America. If youre in Europe, check out [taste_the_code]s build from last year. Of course whatever band youre operating in, Yagi isnt your only roll-your-own option for a LoRa antenna.\nThanks to [Jon Pearce WB2MNF] for the tip!", "title": "\u300cMeshtastic\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u5411\u3051\u306eYagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305f\u6027\u80fd\u300d", "body": "Meshtastic\u3068LoRa\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fYagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cMeshtastic\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u5411\u3051\u306eYagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305f\u6027\u80fd\u300d", "\u300cLoRa\u901a\u4fe1\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5cYagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u300d", "\u300c\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3067\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u306aYagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u5317\u7c73915MHz\u7528Yagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u3068\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u6700\u9069\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8Yagi\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u300d"]}

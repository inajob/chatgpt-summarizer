LoRa is a great, low-power radio communications standards, but sometimes the antennas you get with the modules can leave you wanting more. Thats why [Chris Prioli] at the Gloucester County Amateur Radio Club in the great state of New Jersey have got a Yagi antenna for North Americas 915 MHz LoRa band.\nRight out the gate, their article links to one of ours, where [tastes_the_code] builds a Yagi antenna for the European 868 MHz LoRa. Like [tastes_the_code], the radio club found [Chris]s antenna gives much better reception than what came with the LoRa module. Looking out their window, instead of two Metastatic nodes with a stock antenna, one club member is now connecting to two hundred.\nA simulation of the radiation pattern. Looks like a Yagi, alright.\nNow, the Yagi is directional, so you only get that boost pointed down the axis of the antenna, but at least in simulation they estimate a 7.7 dB front-to-back gain vs under 3 dB for an omnidirectional antenna. Not bad, for a simple 3D print and some stiff wire!\nIf you dont want to re-invent the wheel again, check out the GCARCs GitHub for files if youre in North America. If youre in Europe, check out [taste_the_code]s build from last year. Of course whatever band youre operating in, Yagi isnt your only roll-your-own option for a LoRa antenna.\nThanks to [Jon Pearce WB2MNF] for the tip!"}

However, in the case of Walmarts current offering, it might be worse than its supposed to be. [FoxTailWhipz] bought the Vivitar-branded device and set about investigating its claim that it could deliver high-resolution photos.\nThe Vivatar Retro Keychain Camera costs $12.88, and wears FULL HD and 14MP branding on the packaging. Its actually built by Sakar International, a company that manufactures products for other brands to license. Outside of the branding, though, [FoxTailWhipz] figured the resolution claims were likely misleading. Taking photos quickly showed this was the case, as whatever setting was used, the photos would always come out at 640 x 480, or roughly 0.3 megapixels. He thus decided a teardown would be the best way to determine what was going on inside. You can see it all in the video below.\nPulling the device apart was easy, revealing that the screen and battery are simply attached to the PCB with double-sided tape. With the board removed from the case, the sensor and lens module are visible, with the model number printed on the flex cable. The sensor datasheet tells you what you need to know. Its a 2-megapixel sensor, capable of resolutions up to 1632 x 1212. The camera firmware itself seems to not even use the full resolution, since it only outputs images at 640 x 480.\nIts not that surprising that an ultra-cheap keychain camera doesnt meet the outrageous specs on the box. At the same time, its sad to see major retailers selling products that cant do what they say on the tin. We see this problem a lot, in everything from network cables to oscilloscopes.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a6\u30a9\u30eb\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\u3092\u8abf\u67fb", "body": "\u30a6\u30a9\u30eb\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306f\u5ba3\u4f1d\u901a\u308a\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306f640x480\u3067\u30012MP\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3082\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a6\u30a9\u30eb\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\u3092\u8abf\u67fb", "- Vivitar Retro\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u89e3\u4f53: \u671f\u5f85\u5916\u308c\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u30d5\u30ebHD\u306814MP\u306e\u865a\u507d\u3092\u66b4\u304f\uff01\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u4ed5\u69d8\u3092\u6e80\u305f\u3055\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30e1\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u5c0f\u58f2\u5e97\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u554f\u984c: \u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7"]}

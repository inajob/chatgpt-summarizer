This project delves into the principles of interference, particularly focusing on how light waves interact with very thin films, like those seen in soap bubbles or oil slicks. The post is in German, but you can easily translate it using online tools.\nInterference occurs when waves overlap, either reinforcing each other (constructive interference) or canceling each other out (destructive interference). In this project, [Stoppi] specifically examines how light behaves when passing through thin layers of air trapped between semi-transparent mirrors. When light waves reflect off these mirrors, the difference in path length leads to interference patterns that depend on the layers thickness and the wavelength of the light.\nTo visualize this, [Stoppi] used an interferometer made from semi-transparent mirrors and illuminated it with a bulb to ensure a continuous spectrum of light. By analyzing the transmitted light spectrum with a homemade spectrometer, he observed clear peaks corresponding to specific wavelengths that could pass through the interferometer. These experimental results align well with theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of the setup.\nIf you like pretty patterns, soap bubbles are definitely good for several experiments. Dont forget: pictures or it didnt happen.\n\n", "title": "LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u8584\u819c\u5e72\u6e09\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b", "body": "[Stoppi]\u306f\u3001\u5149\u6ce2\u304c\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u8584\u3044\u819c\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u305f\u6642\u306e\u5e72\u6e09\u73fe\u8c61\u3092\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002\u6ce2\u304c\u91cd\u306a\u308a\u5408\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u5f37\u5316\u5e72\u6e09\u3084\u7834\u58ca\u5e72\u6e09\u304c\u751f\u3058\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u7279\u306b\u8abf\u67fb\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5e72\u6e09\u8a08\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u4e88\u6e2c\u3068\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u4e00\u81f4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u8584\u819c\u5e72\u6e09\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b", "DIY\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u5149\u5e72\u6e09\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u8584\u3044\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044", "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u3067\u306e\u5e72\u6e09\u73fe\u8c61\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30d7\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5e72\u6e09\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u89b3\u5bdf"]}

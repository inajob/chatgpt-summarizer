Just to prove that theyre serious, theyre putting out a $10,000 bounty. Can you get inside?\nThe challenge to hack the chip is simple enough. You need to dump a secret that is hidden at OTP ROW 0xc08. Its 128 bits long, and its protected in two ways\u2014by the RP2350s secure boot and by OTP_DATA_PAGE48_LOCK1. Basically, the chip security features have been activated, and you need to get around them to score the prize.\nThe gauntlet was thrown down ahead of DEF CON, where the new chip was used in the event badges. Raspberry Pi and Hextree.io invited anyone finding a break to visit their booth in the Embedded Systems Village. Its unclear at this stage if anyone claimed the bounty, so we can only assume the hunt remains open. Its been stated that the challenge will run until 4 PM UK time on September 7th, 2024.\nHacking microcontrollers is a tough and exacting art. The GitHub repo provides full details on what you need to do, with the precise rules, terms, and conditions linked at the bottom.

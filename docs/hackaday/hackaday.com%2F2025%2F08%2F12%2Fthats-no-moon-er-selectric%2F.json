These were workhorses and changed typing by moving from typebars to a replaceable wheel. They were expensive, though worth it since many of them still work (including mine). But few of us could afford the $1,000 or more that these machines cost back in the day, especially when you consider that $1,000 was enough to buy a nice car for most of that time. [Tech Tangents] looks at something different: a clone Selectric from the sewing machine and printer company Juki.\nThe typewriter was the brainchild of [Thomas OReilly]. He sold typewriters and knew that a $500 compatible machine would sell. He took the prototype to Juki, which was manufacturing typewriters for Olivetti at the time.\n\nAlthough other typewriters used typeballs, none of them were actual clones and didnt take IBM typeballs. Juki even made their own typeballs. Youd think IBM might have been upset, but they were already moving towards the wheelwriter, which used a daisywheel element. Juki would later make a Xerox-compatible daisywheel printer, again at a fraction of the cost of the original.\nEven the Juki manual was essentially a rip-off of the IBM Selectric manual. Sincerest form of flattery, indeed. It did appear that the ribbon was not a standard IBM cartridge. That makes them hard to find compared to Selectric ribbons, but they are nice since they have correction tape built in. The video mentions that you can find them on eBay and similar sites.\nThere were a few other cost savings. First, the Juki was narrower than most Selectrics. It also had a plastic case, although if you have ever had to carry a Selectric up a few flights of stairs,\u00a0 you might consider that a feature.\nThe Juki in the video doesnt quite work, but it is a quirky machine with an odd history. Today, you can print your own typeballs. We wonder if these would be amenable to computer control like the Selectrics?\n", "title": "- Juki\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u9078\u629e\u5f0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "body": "Juki\u306fIBM Selectric\u3092\u6a21\u5023\u3057\u305f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u9020\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u63a1\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- Juki\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u9078\u629e\u5f0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- IBM Selectric\u3068\u305d\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- Juki\u88fd\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- \u73cd\u3057\u3044Juki\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u5370\u5237\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

But [Surya] says this project works out of the box with common tools such as OpenOCD and pyOCD.\nAs weve cautioned previously, remember that the Pi Pico is only a 3.3 V device. JTAG and SWD dont have set voltages, so in the wild you could run into logic levels from 1.2 V all the way to 5.5 V. While being able to use a bare Pico as a debugger is a neat trick, adding in a level shifter would be a wise precaution.\nLooking to get even more use out of those Pi Picos youve got in the parts bin? How about using it to sniff USB?"}

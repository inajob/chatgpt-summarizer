But [Surya] says this project works out of the box with common tools such as OpenOCD and pyOCD.\nAs weve cautioned previously, remember that the Pi Pico is only a 3.3 V device. JTAG and SWD dont have set voltages, so in the wild you could run into logic levels from 1.2 V all the way to 5.5 V. While being able to use a bare Pico as a debugger is a neat trick, adding in a level shifter would be a wise precaution.\nLooking to get even more use out of those Pi Picos youve got in the parts bin? How about using it to sniff USB?", "title": "\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fJTAG\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fJTAG\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cJTAGprobe\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fJTAG\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300cJTAGprobe: \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cJTAG\u3068SWD\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cUSB\u30b9\u30cb\u30c3\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306ePi Pico\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u300d"]}

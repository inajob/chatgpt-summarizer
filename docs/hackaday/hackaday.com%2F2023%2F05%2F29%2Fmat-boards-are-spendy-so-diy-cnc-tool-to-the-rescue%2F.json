They perform a number of aesthetic and practical functions, and they can also be expensive to purchase. Making them by hand is an option, but its an exacting process. [wooddragon48] felt that a CNC solution would serve this need nicely, and began designing a DIY CNC tool to do exactly that.\nOne of the tricky parts about cutting mat boards is that cuts are at an angle, and there is really no tolerance for overcuts or any kind of visual blemish. CNC control would seem to offer a great solution to both the need for precisely straight cuts, as well as fine control over where cuts begin and end in a way that opens the door to complex designs that would be impractical to do by hand.\n[wooddragon48]s design has an angled cutter designed to plunge perfectly on demand, surrounded by a ring  similar to that on a router  which ensures the cutting tool is always consistently positioned with the material. Its still in the design phase, but this is a type of tool that doesnt yet exist so far as we can tell. The ability to CNC cut mat board, especially in complex designs, would be a huge timesaver.\nArt and DIY CNC have a long history of happy intersection, as we have seen with a CNC router repurposed for string art, a CNC painting robot, and even an interactive abstract sculpture generator."}

This is the reason why the US Surgeon General [Dr. Vivek H. Murthy] is pleading for a health warning label on social media platforms. Much like with warnings on tobacco products, its not expected that such a measure would make social media safe for children and adolescents, but would remind them and their parents about the risks of these platforms.\nWhile this may sound dire for what is at its core about social interactions, there is a growing body of evidence to support the notion that social media can negatively impact mental health. A 2020 systematic review article in Cureus by [Fazida Karim] and colleagues found anxiety and depression to be the most notable negative psychological health outcomes. A 2023 editorial in BMC Psychology by [\u00c1gnes Zsila] and [Marc Eric S. Reyes] concurs with this notion, while contrasting these cons of social media with the pros, such as giving individuals an online community where they feel that they belong.\nUltimately, its important to realize that social media isnt the end-all, be-all of online social interactions. There are still many dedicated forums, IRC channels and newsgroups far away from the prying eyes and social pressure\u00a0 of social media to act out a personality. Having more awareness of how social interactions affect oneself and/or ones children is definitely essential, even if were unlikely to return to the never give out your real name days of\u00a0 the pre-2000s Internet.", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8b66\u544a", "body": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306f\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u306a\u5834\u6240\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u539a\u751f\u9577\u5b98\u306f\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306b\u5065\u5eb7\u8b66\u544a\u8868\u793a\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4e0d\u5b89\u3084\u3046\u3064\u306a\u3069\u306e\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u6307\u6458\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3078\u306e\u5e30\u5c5e\u611f\u306f\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6319\u3052\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8b66\u544a", "\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u696d\u754c\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u306e\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\uff1a\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u3068\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30d8\u30eb\u30b9\uff1a\u8ca0\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u88ab\u5bb3\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76", "\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u6027\uff1a\u30bd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u4ee5\u5916"]}

Weve all seen examples  the carefully crafted blends of flavors, the quality ingredients expertly cooked, the artful platings that make a dramatic presentation at the table. But where the artistry really seems to take off is with desserts, which pastry chefs and confectioners can take to the next level with edible sculptures of chocolate and other sweets that can tower dramatically over the table.\nThats all well and good for the haute cuisine set, but what about the rest of us? We cant all have the talent and drive needed to produce edible art, so perhaps we can leverage technology to help us out. Thats just one of the rationales behind food 3D printing, which is what well be exploring with Ellie Weinstein. Shes the CEO of Cocoa Press, where theyre bringing chocolate 3D printing to the mainstream. Its not as easy as you might think  there are plenty of nuances and engineering challenges when youre trying to print chocolate or any other kind of food. Make sure you stop by and check it out; its sure to be a treat.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, July 5 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter."}

You even have your choice of high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) machine for $200,000, or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) version, which costs more than twice as much. Heres a bit more about how each process works.\nA sea of HPHT machines. Image via Alibaba\nOf course, youll need way more than just the machine and a power outlet. Additional resources are a must, and some expertise would go a long way. Even so, you end up with raw diamonds that need to be processed in order to become gems or industrial components.\nFor HPHT, youd also need a bunch of good graphite, catalysts such as iron and cobalt, and precise control systems for temperature and pressure, none of which are included as a kit with the machine.\nFor CVD, youd need methane and hydrogen gases, and precise control of microwaves or hot filaments. In either case, youre not getting anywhere without diamond seed crystals.\nRight now, the idea of Joe Hacker making diamonds in his garage seems about as far off as home 3D printing did in about 1985. But we got there, didnt we?

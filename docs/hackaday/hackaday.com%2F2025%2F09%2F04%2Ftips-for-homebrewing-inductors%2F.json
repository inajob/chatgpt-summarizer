Get a wire. Coil it up. Right? Well, the devil is definitely in the details, and [Nick] wants to share his ten tips for building the perfect inductor. We dont know about perfect, but we do think he brings up some very good points. Check out his video below.\nIf you are winding wire around your finger (or, as it appears in the video, a fork) or you are using a beefy ferrite core, youll find something interesting in the video.\n\nOf course, the issue with inductors is that wires arent perfect, nor are core materials. Factors like this lead to inefficiency and loss, sometimes in a frequency-dependent way.\nIt looks like [Nick] is building a large switching power supply, so the subject inductor is a handful. He demonstrates some useful computational tools for analyzing data about cores, for example.\nWe learned a lot watching the tricks, but we were more interested in the inductors construction. We have to admit that the computed inductance of the coil matched quite closely to the measured value.\nNeed a variable inductor? No problem. Before ferrite cores, good coils were a lot harder to wind.\n"}

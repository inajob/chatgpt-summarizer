Revert to an old-style manual brush? If youre [luisengineering], not a bit of it. Hes modified an electric toothbrush with the only sensible power plant, a three-horsepower twin cylinder four-stroke gasoline motor. Youll need to turn on translated subtitles from the original German to watch it, but we hope youll agree its worth it.\nAfter explaining the problem, the video below the break continues with the assembly of the motor, a model unit available through the usual online suppliers. This alone is interesting, for no doubt many of us have seen these motors for sale and retain some curiosity about them. We expected him to retain the electric drive for the toothbrush and use a generator, but instead, he hooks up the motor via a shaft directly to the input gear. With three horsepower behind the brush, this will surely shift that stubborn plaque! Astoundingly as you can see in the video below the break the contraption works, and both he and a friends perform their dental ablutions with it.\nWe like the blend of craziness and engineering embodied by this project, and we commend it to you on that basis. If youre short of electric toothbrush modding ideas, how about an engraving tool?\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u81ea\u5bb6\u767a\u96fb\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u304c\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u3044\u6642\u3001\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3001\u6b6f\u57a2\u3082\u843d\u3061\u308b! \u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u3060\u3051\u3069\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7cbe\u795e\u3092\u611f\u3058\u308b\u3057\u3001\u5f6b\u523b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u81ea\u5bb6\u767a\u96fb\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u306b3\u99ac\u529b\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u6280\u8853\uff01\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u300d", "\u300c\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u6b6f\u78e8\u304d\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3001\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff01\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u878d\u5408\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u4e00\u54c1\u300d"]}

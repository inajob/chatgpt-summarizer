Are they scared of massive arcs that rip through the air, making a lot of noise in the process? [Jay] from the Plasma Channel sure hopes so, because thats how his bear deterrent works!\n[Jay] calls it the Bear Blaster 5000. Right from the drop, this thing looks like some crazy weapon out of Halo.\u00a0Thats because it throws huge arcs at 280,000 volts. The basic concept behind it is simple enough\u2014a battery drives a circuit which generates (kinda) low voltage AC. This is fed to the two voltage multipliers which are set up with opposite polarity to create the greatest possible potential difference between the two electrodes they feed. The meaty combination is able to arc across electrodes spaced over four inches apart. Its all wrapped up in a super-cool 3D printed housing that really shows off the voltage multiplier banks.\n\n\n\nGiven its resemblance to a stun gun, you might think the idea is to jab an attacking bear with it. But the reality is, if the bear is close enough that you could press this device against it, youre already lunch. [Jay] explains that its more about scaring the animal off with the noise and light it produces. Wed certainly take a few steps back if we heard this thing fire off in the woods.\n[Jay] does a great job of explaining how the whole setup works, as well as showing off its raw ability to spark. Weve seen some great builds from [Jay] before, too, like this beefy custom flyback transformer.\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u30af\u30de\u5bfe\u7b56\u300cBear Blaster 5000\u300d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "body": "\u300cBear Blaster 5000\u300d\u306f\u3001\u718a\u3092\u97f3\u3068\u5149\u3067\u8ffd\u3044\u6255\u3046\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u30af\u30de\u5bfe\u7b56\u300cBear Blaster 5000\u300d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c", "- 280,000\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u30af\u30de\u3092\u6483\u9000\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u96fb\u5727\u500d\u5897\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u30af\u30de\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30af\u30de\u9632\u6b62\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u97f3\u3068\u5149\u3067\u52d5\u7269\u3092\u5a01\u5687\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

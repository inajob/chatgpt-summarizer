The ceramic parts have an interesting texture, and he wondered if the same techniques could work with plastics, too. It turns out it can, as you can see in the video below.\nCeramic printing, of course, doesnt get solid right away, so the plastic can actually take more dramatic patterns than the ceramic. The workflow starts with Blender and winds up with a standard printer.\n\nThe example prints are lamps, although you could probably do a lot with this technique. You can select where the texturing occurs, which is important in this case to allow working threads to avoid having texture.\nYou will need a Blender plugin to get similar results. The target printer was a Bambu, but theres no reason this wouldnt work with any FDM printer.\nWe admire this kind of artistic print. Weve talked before about how you can use any texture to get interesting results. If you need help getting started with Blender, our tutorial is one place to start.\n", "title": "- \u9676\u5668\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "body": "Claywoven\u306f\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u5370\u5237\u3092\u4e3b\u306b\u884c\u3044\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3082\u5fdc\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9676\u5668\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3078\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "- Blender\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u7167\u660e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u624b\u6cd5", "- FDM\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9020\u5f62\u6280\u8853", "- Blender\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

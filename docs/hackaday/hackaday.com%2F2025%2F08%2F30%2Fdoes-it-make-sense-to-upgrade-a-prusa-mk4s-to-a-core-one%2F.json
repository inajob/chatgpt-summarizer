While for a bedslinger-to-bedslinger upgrade this can make a lot of sense, the bedslinger to CoreXY Core One upgrade path is a bit more drastic. Recently the [Aurora Tech] channel had a look at which upgrade path makes the most sense, and in which scenario.\nA big part of the comparison is the time and money spent compared to the print result, as you have effectively four options. Either you stick with the MK4S, get the DIY Core One (~8 hours of assembly time), get the pre-assembled Core One (more $$), or get the upgrade kit (also ~8 hours). Theres also the fifth option of getting the enclosure for the MK4S, but it costs about as much as the upgrade kit, so that doesnt make a lot of logical sense.\nIn terms of print quality, its undeniable that the CoreXY motion system provides better results, with less ringing and better quality with tall prints, but unless youre printing more than basic PLA and PETG, or care a lot about the faster print speeds of the CoreXY machine with large prints, the fully enclosed Core One is a bit overkill and sticking with the bedslinger may be the better choice.\nThe long and short of it is that you have look at each option and consider what works best for your needs and your wallet.\n\n"}

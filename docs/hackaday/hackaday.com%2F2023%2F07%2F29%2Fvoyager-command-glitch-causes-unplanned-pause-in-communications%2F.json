Of course, at a distance of nearly 20 billion kilometers, even fractions of a degree can make a huge difference, especially since the spacecrafts high-gain antenna (HGA) is set up for very narrow beamwidths; 2.3\u00b0 on the S-band channel, and a razor-thin 0.5\u00b0 on the X-band side. That means that communications between the spacecraft and the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex  the only station capable of talking to Voyager 2 now that it has dipped so far below the plane of the ecliptic  are on pause until the spacecraft is reoriented.\nLuckily, NASA considered this as a possibility and built safety routines into Voyagers program that will hopefully get it back on track. The program uses the onboard star tracker to get a fix on the bright star Canopus, and from there figures out which way the spacecraft needs to move to get pointed back at Earth. The contingency program runs automatically several times a year, just in case something like this happens.\nThats the good news; the bad news is that the program wont run again until October 15. While thats really not that far away, mission controllers will no doubt find it an agonizingly long time to be incommunicado. And while NASA is outwardly confident that communications will be restored, theres no way to be sure until we actually get to October and see what happens. Fingers crossed."}

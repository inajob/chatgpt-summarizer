[ThunderOwl] happened to be playing in this space, turning a heavily-modified Technics stereo stack into an awesome neo-retro PC case. Meet the TechnicsPC!\nThis is good. We like this.\nYou have to hunt across BlueSky for the goodies, but its well worth it. The main build concerned throwing a PC into an old Technics receiver, along with a pair of LCD displays and a bunch of buttons for control. If the big screens werent enough of a tell that youre looking at an anachronism, the USB ports just below the power switch will tip you off. A later addition saw a former Technics tuner module stripped out and refitted with card readers and a DVD/CD drive. Perhaps the most era-appropriate addition, though, is the scrolling LED display on top. Stuffed inside another tuner module, its a super 90s touch that somehow just works.\nThese days, off-the-shelf computers are so fancy and glowy that DIY casemodding has fallen away from the public consciousness. And yet, every so often, we see a magnificent build like this one that reminds us just how creative modders can really be. Video after the break.\n\n\nLive test. All more or less as planned, as cons  it does not interrupt ongoing scroll cycle with new stuff, it puts new content info with next cycle, so, kinda info delays:\n[image or embed]\n\u2014 ThunderOwl (@thunderowl.one) 10 March 2025 at 07:39\n"}

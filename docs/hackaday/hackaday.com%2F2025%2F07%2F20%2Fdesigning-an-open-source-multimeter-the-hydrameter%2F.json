In this long and detailed video, [John] walks us through his solutions to various challenges he had while designing his own multimeter. We covered this multimeter last year, and this new video elaborates on the design of the HydraMeter which has been a work in progress for years now.\n\nThe basic design feeds voltage, current, and resistance front-ends into an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), which then feeds into a microcontroller and out to the (detachable) display. You can find the KiCad design files on the GitHub page. There is also a write-up on hackaday.io.\nThe user interface for the meter is opinionated, and perhaps not to everyones taste. In the video, [John] talks a little bit about why he made the UI work the way that it does, and he noted that adding a rotary range switch is a goal for version 2.0.\nThe case is 3D printed and [John] had glowing things to say about his Bambu printer. He also had glowing things to say about D-sub connectors, but he did not have glowing things to say about Solid Edge, the CAD software he used to design the case.\nThank you, [John], for putting this video together; it is an excellent resource. We look forward to seeing version 2.0 develop soon!\n", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHydraMeter\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b", "body": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHydraMeter\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cHydraMeter\u300d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b", "- \u96fb\u5727\u30fb\u62b5\u6297\u30fb\u96fb\u6d41\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "- John Duffy\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u8ab2\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30af\u30e9\u30b9", "- KiCad\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c7\u30a4\u3067\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068UI\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

Hull] and [Inna Zakharevich]s Turing complete origami computer.\nStarting with the constraint of flat origami (the paper folds back on top of itself), the researchers designed a system that could replicate all the functionality of the previously-proven Turing complete Rule 110 automaton. The researchers walk us through the construction of AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT gates via paper as well as the various wires and gadgets that connect the operators or filter out noise.\nEverything ends up a large mess of triangles and hexagons with optional creases to make the whole thing work. While the origami computer probably wont be helping you slice 3D prints anytime soon, much like a Magic computer, the engineering and math involved may prove useful in other applications.\nWere no strangers to origami here, having covered origami machines, medical robots, or using a desktop vinyl cutter to pre-score your project."}

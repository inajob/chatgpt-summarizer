It\u2019s a strange machine, made up of a bunch of IBM System 360 mainframes connected together to a common memory unit, with all sorts of custom peripherals to support keeping track of airplanes in the sky. Absolutely go read the in-depth article on that machine if it sparks your curiosity.\nIt got me thinking about how strange computers were in the early days, and how boringly similar they\u2019ve all become. Just looking at the word sizes of old machines is a great example. Over the last, say, 40 years, things that do computing have had 4, 8, 16, 32, or even 64-bit words. You noticed the powers-of-two trend going on here, right? Basically starting with the lowly Intel 4004, it\u2019s been round numbers ever since.\nHarvard Mark I, by [Topory]On the other side of the timeline, though, you get strange beasts. The classic PDP-8 had 12-bit words, while its predecessors the PDP-6 and PDP-1 had 36 bits and 18 bits respectively. (Factors of six?) There\u2019s a string of military guidance computers that had 27-bit words, while the Apollo Guidance computer ran 15-bit words. UNIVAC III had 25-bit words, putting the 23-bit Harvard Mark I to shame.\nI wasn\u2019t there, but it gives you the feeling that each computer is a unique, almost hand-crafted machine. Some must have made their odd architectural choices to suit particular functions, others because some designer had a cleaver idea. I\u2019m not a computer historian, but I\u2019m sure that the word lengths must tell a number of interesting stories.\nOn the whole, though, it gives the impression of a time when each computer was it\u2019s own unique machine, before the convergence of everything to roughly the same architectural ideas. A much more hackery time, for lack of a better word. We still see echoes of this in the people who make their own \u201cretro\u201d computers these days, either virtually, on a breadboard, or emulated in the fabric of an FPGA. It\u2019s not just nostalgia, though, but a return to a time when there was more creative freedom: a time before 64 bits took over.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

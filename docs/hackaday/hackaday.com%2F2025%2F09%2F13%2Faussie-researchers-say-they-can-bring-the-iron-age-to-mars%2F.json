(Image: Swinburne University)\nEvery school child can tell you these days that Mars is red because its rusty. The silicate rock of the martian crust and regolith is very rich in iron oxide. Now Australian researchers at CSIRO and Swinburn University claim they know how to break that iron loose.\nIn-situ Resource Utilization (IRSU) is a big deal in space exploration, with good reason. Every kilogram of resources you get on site is one you dont have to fight the tyranny of the rocket equation for. Iron might not be something youd ever be able to haul from Earth to the next planet over, but when you can make it on site? You can build like a Victoria is still queen and its time to flex on the French.\nThe key to the process seems to be simple pyrolysis: they describe putting dirt that is geochemically analogous to martian regolith into a furnace, and heating to 1000 \u00b0C under Martian atmospheric conditions to get iron metal. At 1400 \u00b0C, they were getting iron-silicon alloys likely the stuff steelmakers call ferrosilicon, which isnt something youd build a crystal palace with.\nIts not clear how economical piling red dust into a thousand-degree furnace would be on Mars thats certainly not going to cut it on Earth but compared to launch costs from Earth, its not unimaginable that martian dirt could be considered ore."}

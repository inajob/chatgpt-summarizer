A paper making extraordinary claims came out, the procedure to make LK-99 was followed in multiple labs around the world, and then it was tested. It didn\u2019t turn out to conduct particularly well at all. After a couple weeks of global superconductor frenzy, everything is back to normal again.\nWhat the heck happened? First of all, the paper itself made extravagant claims about a holy-grail kind of material. There was a very tantalizing image of a black pellet floating in mid air, which certainly seems like magic, even though it\u2019s probably only run-of-the-mill ferromagnetism in the end. But it made for a great photo-op in a news-starved August, and the then-still-Twitterverse took to it by storm. And then the news outlets piled on the hype fest.\nIf you\u2019re feeling duped by the whole turn of events, you\u2019re not alone. But the warning signs were there from the beginning, if you took the time to look. For me, it was the closing line of the paper: \u201cWe believe that our new development will be a brand-new historical event that opens a new era for humankind.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the kind of healthy skepticism and cautious conclusion that real science runs best on. Reading the paper, I had almost no understanding of the underlying materials science, but I knew enough about human nature to suspect that the authors had rushed the paper out the door without sufficient scrutiny.\nHow can we keep from being fooled again? Carl Sagan\u2019s maxim that \u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\u201d is a good start. To that, I would add that science moves slowly, and that extraordinary evidence can only accumulate over time. So when you see hype science, simply wait to draw any conclusions. If it is the dawn of a new era, you\u2019ll have a lot of time to figure out what room-temperature superconductivity means to you in the rosy future. And if it\u2019s just a flash in the pan, you won\u2019t have gotten your hopes up.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

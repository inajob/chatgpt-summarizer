Sonic the Hedgehog was one of them SEGA would never in a million years been willing to port its flagship platformer to another system. Well, SEGA might not in a million years, but [reassembler] has started that process after only thirty four.\nBoth the SEGA Mega Drive (thats the Genesis for North Americans) and Amiga have Motorola 68k processors, but that doesnt mean you can run code from one on the other: the memory maps dont match, and the way graphics are handled is completely different. The SEGA console uses so-called chunky graphics, which is how we do it today. Amiga, on the other hand, is all about the bitplanes; thats why it didnt get a DOOM port back in the day, which may-or-may not be what killed the platform.\nIn this first video of what promises to be a series, [reassembler] takes us through his process of migrating code from the Mega Drive to Amiga, starting specifically with the SEGA loading screen animation, with a preview of the rest of the work to come. While watching someone wrestle with 68k assembler is always interesting, the automation hes building up to do it with python is the real star here. Once this port is done, that toolkit should really grease the wheels of bringing other Mega Drive titles over.\nIt should be noted that since the Mega Drive was a 64 colour machine, [reassembler] is targeting the A1200 for his Sonic port, at least to start. He plans to reprocess the graphics for a smaller-palette A500 version once thats done. Thats good, because it would be a bit odd to have a DOOM-clone for the A500 while being told a platformer like Sonic is too much to ask. If anyone can be trusted to pull this project off, its [reassembler], whose OutRun: Amiga Edition is legendary in the retro world, even if we seem to have missed covering it.\nIf only someone had given us a tip off, hint hint.\n\n", "title": "- \u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u300c\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u3092\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u306b\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u59cb\u52d5\u3002\u304a\u305d\u3089\u304f\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u300c\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u300d\u3092\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- \u30e1\u30ac\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3068\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\uff1a68k\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u306e\u6226\u3044", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u5411\u3051\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u79fb\u690d\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u958b\u59cb", "- Python\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u79fb\u690d\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30ac\u7248\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b"]}

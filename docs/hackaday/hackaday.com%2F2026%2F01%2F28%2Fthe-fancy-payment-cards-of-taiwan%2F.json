You could even try and pay with a cheque, though the pen-and-paper method has mostly fallen out of favor these days. But if youre a little more modern, you might use a tap-to-pay feature on a credit or debit card.\nIn Taiwan, though, theres another unique way to pay. The island nation has a whole ecosystem of bespoke payment cards, and you can even get one that looks like a floppy disk!\n\nIts Not About The Money, Money, Money\nA regular adult iPASS card. Like many mass transit smartcards, its based on MIFARE contactless technology. Credit: iPASS\nLike so many other countries with highly-developed public transport systems, Taiwan implemented a smartcard ticketing system many years ago. Back in December 2007, it launched iPASS (\u4e00\u5361\u901a), initially for use by riders on the Kaohsiung Metro system which opened in March 2008. The cards were launched using MIFARE technology, as seen in a wide range of contactless smart card systems in other public transport networks around the world.\nThe system was only ever supposed to be used to pay fares on public transport using the pre-paid balance on the card. Come 2014, however, management of the cards was passed to the iPASS Corporation. The new organization quickly established the cards use as a widespread form of payment at a huge variety of stores across Taiwan. The earliest adopters were OK MART, SUNFAR 3C, and a handful of malls and department stores. Soon enough, partnerships with FamilyMart and Hi-Life convenience stores followed, and the use of the card quickly spread from there.\niPASS can be used across much of the public transport in Taiwan, and the cards are also compatible with smartphone wallets.

For example, NPC issued an iPASS card that offered cheaper prices on gasoline at affiliated gas stations. Furthermore, no longer did your iPASS have to be a rigid, rectangular plastic card. You can buy a normal one if you like, but you can also get an iPASS built into prayer beads, laced into a leather bracelet, or even baked into a faux floppy disk.\u00a0 The latter specifically notes that its not a real disk, of course; it only has iPASS functionality and will not work if you put it in a floppy drive. It is, however, a startlingly good recreation, with the proper holes cut out for write protect and density and a real metal sheath. On the translucent yellow version, you can even see what appears to be the fabric inside that would be used to protect the spinning magnetic platter.\nNovelty iPass cards are common. Some are merely fun prints or designs, while others go far outside the usual smartcard format\u2014like this novelty floppy disk.

Where a regular iPASS card costs NT$100 or so, a novelty version like the floppy disk or train costs more like NT$500-$600. That might sound like a lot, but in the latter case, youre only talking about $15 USD or so. If so desired, though, you dont need to carry a card or keychain, or floppy disk at all. Its possible to use an iPASS with contactless smartphone and smartwatch wallets like Google Wallet and Garmin Pay.\niPASS Cards are typically sold empty with no value, and must have money transferred to the card prior to use. Notably, the money stored on the cards is backed by the Union Bank of Taiwan. This provides a certain level of peace of mind. Even if it wasnt there, though, there isnt so much to lose if things do go wrong\u2014as any individual card is limited to storing a maximum of NT$10,000 (~$320 USD).\nYou can use a little train as your iPASS card if youre willing to spend just a little more money.

It similarly offers novelty versions of its cards, and these days, it can be used on most public transport in Taiwan and at a range of convenience stores. Like the iPASS, its limited to storing up to NT$10,000, with balances backed by the Cathay United Bank. 7-Eleven has also joined the fray with its iCash cards, which are available in some very cute novelty styles. However, where there are tens of millions of users across EasyCard and iPASS, iCash has not had the same level of market penetration.\nAs Easycard demonstrates, you can put a contactless payment chip in just about anything.

However, if you happen to find yourself in Taiwan, you might find the iPASS to be a very useful tool indeed. You can load it once with a bunch of money, and then run around on buses and trains while buying yourself snacks and beverages all over town. Plus, if you buy the floppy disk one, youll have an awesome souvenir to bring back with you, and you can entertain all your payment-card-obsessed friends with tales of your adventures. All in all, the banking heavyweights of the world would do well to learn from the whimsical example of the iPASS Corporation."}

[yu3375349136], a scientist from Guangdong, has been producing some high quality microchemistry videos that are worth a watch.\nWhile some polyglots out there wont be phased, we appreciate the captioning for Western audiences using the elemental symbols we all know and love in addition to the Simplified Chinese. Reactions featured are typically colorful, but simple with a limited number of reagents. Being able to watch diffusion of the chemicals through the water drop and the results in the center when more than one chemical is used are mesmerizing.\nWe do wish there was a bit more substance to the presentation, and were aware not all readers will be thrilled to point their devices to Douyin (known outside of China as TikTok) to view them, but we have to admit some of the reactions are beautiful.\nIf youre interested in other science-meets-art projects, how about thermal camera landscapes of Iceland, and given the comments on some of these videos, how do you tell if its AI or real anyway?"}

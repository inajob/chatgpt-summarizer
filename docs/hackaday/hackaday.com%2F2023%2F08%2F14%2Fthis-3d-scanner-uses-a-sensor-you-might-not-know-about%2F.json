Its one of these which [Enginoor] has taken for the sensor in a 3D scanner, an industrial laser displacement sensor.\nThis sensor measures distance, but its not one of the time-of-flight sensors were familiar with. Instead its similar to a photographic rangefinder, relying on the parallax angle as seen from a sensor a distance apart from the laser. They are extremely expensive due to their high-precision construction, but happily they can be found at a more affordable level second-hand from decommissioned machinery.\nIn this case the sensor is mounted on an X-Y gantry, and scans the part making individual point measurements. The sensor is interfaced to a Teensy, which in turn spits the data back to a PC for processing. By their own admission its not the most practical of builds, but for us thats not the point. We hope that bringing these parts to the attention of our community might see them used in other ways.\nWeve featured huge numbers of 3D scanners over the years, including a look at how not to make one.", "title": "3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u7523\u696d\u7528\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01", "body": "3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u5de5\u696d\u7528\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u305f\u3081\u3001\u89e3\u4f53\u3055\u308c\u305f\u6a5f\u68b0\u304b\u3089\u4e2d\u53e4\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306fX-Y\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u3001\u500b\u5225\u306e\u70b9\u306e\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306fTeensy\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066PC\u306b\u9001\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671f\u5f85\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u7523\u696d\u7528\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01", "\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u30663D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u578b\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u8ddd\u96e2\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\uff01", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u30dd\u30d4\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u306a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u306f\u4e00\u98a8\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01", "\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u306a\u3044\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u8ddd\u96e2\u8a08\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u30663D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u884c\u304a\u3046\uff01"]}

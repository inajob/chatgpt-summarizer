Not satisfied with that limitation, [Andre Basche] reverse engineered the protocol used by the app, and released a Python library and associated Home Assistant plugin to interface with a wide array of Haier appliances, which includes brands like Hoover, Candy, GE Appliances and others.\nUnfortunately, it looks like his efforts have gotten him into a bit of legal hot water. In an issue recently opened on the projects GitHub page, [Andre] explains the circumstances and legal options that have led him to consider pulling the repositories completely  mostly due to the cost of mounting a legal defense to the cease  desist from Haier Europe.\nWhats ironic here is that Haier has been part of the Connectivity Standard Alliance (CSA) since 2022, whose goal is to promote universal open IoT standards, including Matter.\nIts possible that a legal defense will be mounted against this CD from Haier within the coming days. Yet regardless of the outcome here, it remains problematic that these IoT-enabled Haier appliances are connected to the Haier servers. Ideally they would be controlled locally, which is the goal of projects like [Miguel \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez Vicente]s ESP Haier, that uses an ESP8266 to connect Haier AC units to the local WiFi and e.g. HA instances, all without requiring internet access.\nThis is sadly just one more example of why building your own off-line smart home can be such an incredible struggle.\nThanks to [Ar3itrary] for the tip.", "title": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306eIoT\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3001\u5bb6\u96fb\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "body": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066IoT\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u304c\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3055\u308c\u3001Python\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u305b\u305a\u306bAC\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u6cd5\u7684\u306a\u554f\u984c\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306eIoT\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3001\u5bb6\u96fb\u3092\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3001Python\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305fHome Assistant\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u516c\u958b", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u304c\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u306e\u524a\u9664\u3092\u8981\u6c42\u3057\u6cd5\u7684\u554f\u984c\u306b\u767a\u5c55", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42"]}

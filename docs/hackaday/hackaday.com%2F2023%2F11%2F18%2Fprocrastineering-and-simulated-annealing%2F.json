This left \u201cplenty of time\u201d to flash the badges on Thursday afternoon, but they were admittedly still warm as the first attendees filed in on Friday morning. While I\u2019ve always noted that the last minute is the best minute, this was a little close, and frankly there was an uncaught bug that we would have noticed if we had a few more hours to just play with it before showtime.\nBut we were by no means slacking. On the contrary, a few of us were putting in nights and full weekend days for six or eight weeks beforehand. The problem was hard, and the path to a solution was never clear, and changed depending on the immovability of the roadblocks hit along the way. This is, honestly, a pretty normal hacker development pattern.\nWhat was interesting to me was how similar the process was to simulated annealing. This is an optimization method where you explore more of the solution space in the beginning, when the metaphorical \u201ctemperature\u201d is hot. Later, as you\u2019re getting closer to a good solution, you want to refine in smaller and smaller steps \u2013 it cools down. This rate of \u201ccooling\u201d is a tremendously important parameter in practice.\nAnd this is exactly the way the badge development felt. We were searching in a very big solution space in the beginning, and many aspects of the firmware infrastructure were in flux. As it got closer and closer to a working solution, more and more of the code settled down, and the changes got smaller. In retrospect, this happened naturally, and you can\u2019t always control or plan for the eureka moments, but I wonder if it\u2019s worth thinking of a project this way. Instead of milestones, temperatures? Instead of a deadline, a freeze date.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

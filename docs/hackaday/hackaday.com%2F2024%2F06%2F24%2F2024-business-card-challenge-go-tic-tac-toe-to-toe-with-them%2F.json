And its vital that you stand out from the crowd somehow. To that end, Electrical  Computer Engineer [Ryan Chan] designed a tidy card that plays tic-tac-toe.\nInstead of X and O, the players are indicated by blue and red LEDs. Rather than having a button at every position, there is one big control button that gets pressed repeatedly until your LED is in the desired position, and then you press and hold to set it and switch control to the other player. In addition to two-player mode, the recipient of your card can also play alone against the ATMega.\nThe brains of this operation is an ATMega328P-AU with the Arduino UNO bootloader for ease of programming. Schematic and code are available if you want to make your own, but we suggest implementing some type of changes to make it your own. Speaking of, [Ryan]\u00a0 has several next steps in mind, including charlieplexing the LEDs, using either USB-C or a coin cell for power, upgrading the AI, and replacing the control button with a capacitive pad or two. Be sure to check it out in action in the two videos after the break.\n\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9: \u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "body": "\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e[Ryan Chan]\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u540d\u523a\u3067\u306e\u3008\u25cb\u00d7\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3009\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u30662\u4eba\u5bfe\u6226\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001ATMega328P-AU\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u7701\u96fb\u529b\u5316\u7b49\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u0633\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u3084\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9: \u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u30c6\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30c6\u30a3\uff1aLED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u540d\u523a", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u540d\u523a\uff1atic-tac-toe\u540d\u523a\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\uff1atic-tac-toe\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4ed8\u304d"]}

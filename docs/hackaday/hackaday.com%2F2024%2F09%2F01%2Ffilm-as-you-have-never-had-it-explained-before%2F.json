Using it presents an artistic and technical challenge, and it lends an aesthetic to your work which is difficult to find in other ways. But particularly when it comes to moving pictures, how many of us have ever ventured beyond the Super 8 cartridge? If youre not lucky enough to have a Spielberg budget, [Stand-Up Maths] is here with a video taking the viewer through the various movie film formats. He claims its the first video shot for YouTube in 35mm, and given that his first point is about the costs involved, we can see why.\nIn particular it serves as an introduction to the various film terms and aspect ratios. We all know what full frame and IMAX are, but do many of us know what they really mean in camera terms. A particularly neat demonstration comes when he has two cameras side by side with the same stock as a split screen, one 35mm and the other 16mm. The cheaper smaller framed format is good quality, but using a profession resolution chart you can see some of the differences clearly. The full film is below the break, and wed suggest you watch it in the full 4K resolution if you are able to.\nMeanwhile, some of us have been known to dabble in 8mm film, and even sometimes shoot footage with it.\n\n\nThanks [Jurjen] for the tip."}

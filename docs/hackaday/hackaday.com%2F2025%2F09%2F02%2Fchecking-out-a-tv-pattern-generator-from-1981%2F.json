While many people were more or less satisfied if their TV picture was reasonably recognizable and clear, meaningful diagnostic work or calibration required specialized tools. [Thomas Scherrer] provides a close look at one such tool, the Philips PM 5519 GX Color TV Pattern Generator from 1981.\nThis Casio handheld TV even picked up the test pattern once the cable was disconnected, the pattern generator acting like a miniature TV station.\nThe Philips PM 5519 was a serious piece of professional equipment for its time, and [Thomas] walks through how the unit works and even opens it up for a peek inside, before hooking it up to both an oscilloscope and a TV in order to demonstrate the different functions.\nTools like this were important because they could provide known-good test patterns that were useful not just for troubleshooting and repair, but also for tasks like fine-tuning TV settings, or verifying the quality of broadcast signals. Because TVs were complex analog systems, these different test patterns would help troubleshoot and isolate problems by revealing what a TV did (and didnt) have trouble reproducing.\nAs mentioned, televisions at the time had no self-diagnostics nor any means of producing test patterns of their own, so a way to produce known-good reference patterns was deeply important.\nTV stations used to broadcast test patterns after the days programming was at an end, and some dedicated folks have even reproduced the hardware that generated these patterns from scratch.\n\n", "title": "1981\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u7528\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cPhilips PM 5519 GX\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306f\u81ea\u52d5\u8a3a\u65ad\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1981\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u7528\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cPhilips PM 5519 GX\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30fb\u8abf\u6574\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u751f\u6210\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b", "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u8a3a\u65ad\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8996\u70b9\uff1a\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u89e3\u8aac", "\u65e7\u5f0f\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5f79\u5272"]}

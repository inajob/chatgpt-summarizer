One way is to pull out all the tools in the hackers kit  with logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and bit-banged software in a desperate attempt to reverse engineer the original protocol. The other way is to have a really, really deep junk bin that just happens to contain exactly the right pieces that would have been used decades ago.\nFor recovering data from a 25-year-old PCMCIA memory card, [Dave] from Vintage Apparatus chose the latter method. But to be fair, characterizing the stash of gear he had to select from as a junk bin is pretty insulting. Its more like a museum of retro technology, which just so happened to hold \u00a0Toshiba Libretto, a subnotebook computer hailing from the late 1990s. The machine sports a pair of PCMCIA slots and was just the thing to read the data from the old 32 MB SanDisk flash card, which once lived in a backpack-mounted GPS system for surveyors.\nIf this hack sounds as easy as plugging things into an old computer, youd be right  if you just happen to have a stack of floppies containing the Windows 98 drivers for said things. So [Dave]s task became a game of finding the right combination of cards that already had the drivers installed and would provide the connectivity needed to get the data off the flash card. Between a suspiciously crunchy-sounding floppy drive and an Ethernet card dongle badly in need of some contact cleaner, cobbling together the right hardware was a bit of a chore. After that, a lot of the hack was [Dave] just remembering how we used to do things back in the day, with the eventual solution being transferring over the files to an FTP server on a Raspberry Pi.\nThe video below tells the whole saga, but the real treat might just be the Vintage Apparatus collection of gear. Incidentally, we really like [Dave]s idea for storing associated bits and bobs.\n\n", "title": "25\u5e74\u524d\u306ePCMCIA\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "25\u5e74\u524d\u306ePCMCIA\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4e00\u82e6\u52b4\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092Raspberry Pi\u306eFTP\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u8ee2\u9001\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002\u8981\u70b9\u306f\u3001\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["25\u5e74\u524d\u306ePCMCIA\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u56de\u5fa9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6280\u8853\u306e\u535a\u7269\u9928\u304b\u3089\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30ae\u30a2\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3066\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b", "\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6b63\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "Windows 98\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u56de\u5fa9\u4f5c\u696d", "Raspberry Pi\u4e0a\u306eFTP\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u8ee2\u9001\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

Perhaps we should build some of [MakersFunDuck]s Moisture Duck boards. As you can see in the video below, the simple PCB with an ATtiny13A tells you when it is time to water the plants. The video also covers several exotic methods of determining the watering status, some of which are pretty complex.\nThe board is simple because the operation of the device is simple. A fixed resistor creates a voltage divider with the soil, and dry soil has higher resistance than moist soil. A pot sets a threshold, and the microcontroller measures the voltages.\nOf course, if you cant remember to water the plants, you probably cant remember to change batteries either. So the device sleeps most of the time, and only wakes up every eight seconds to conserve battery. It would be nice to alarm on a low battery, and, honestly, we would probably have made the sleep time longer.\nThe video covers how he minimizes corrosion, but we arent sure how well the board will survive in damp soil, but with a little protection, it might last a while. Besides that, you could probably just consider them almost disposable.\nIf you are really lazy, you can also automate the actual watering. You can even build that into a smart flower pot.\n\n", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u6c34\u3084\u308a\u5668", "body": "ATtiny13A\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fMoisture Duck\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u571f\u58cc\u306e\u6e7f\u5ea6\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u690d\u7269\u306e\u6c34\u3084\u308a\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u8005\u306f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u6c34\u306b\u6fe1\u308c\u308b\u3068\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u306b\u6b20\u3051\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u6c34\u3084\u308a\u5668", "\u690d\u7269\u306e\u6c34\u3084\u308a\u3092\u4fc3\u3059ATtiny13A\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u690d\u7269\u306e\u6c34\u5206\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u6d88\u8017\u3092\u9632\u304e\u306a\u304c\u3089\u690d\u7269\u3092\u7ba1\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9632\u6c34\u52a0\u5de5\u3067\u9577\u6301\u3061\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u6c34\u3084\u308a\u690d\u6728\u9262\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

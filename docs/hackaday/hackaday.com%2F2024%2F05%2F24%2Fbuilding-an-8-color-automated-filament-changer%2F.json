Enter the 8-Track from [Armored_Turtle], which will swap between 8 filaments for you!\nThe system is modular, with each spool of filament installed in a drybox with its own filament feeder .The dryboxes connect to the 8-Track changer via pogo pins for communication and power. While [Armored_Turtle] is currently using the device on a Voron printer, hes designed it so that it can be easily modified to suit other printers. As its modular, its also not locked into running 8 filaments. Redesigning it to use more or less is easy enough thanks to its modular design.\nThe design hasnt been publicly released yet, but [Armored_Turtle] states they hope to put it on Github when its ready. Its early days, but we love the chunky design of those actively-heated drybox filament cassettes. Theyre a great step up from just keeping filament hanging on a rod, and they ought to improve print performance in addition to enabling multi-filament switching.\nWeve seen some other neat work in this space before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Keith Olson for the tip!]"}

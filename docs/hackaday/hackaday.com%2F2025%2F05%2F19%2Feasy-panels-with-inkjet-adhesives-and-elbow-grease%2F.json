Looking good isnt easy, but luckily [Accidental Science] has a tutorial for a quick-and-easy front panel technique in the video below.\nIt starts with regular paper, and an inkjet or laser printer to print your design. The paper then gets coated on both sides: matte varnish on the front, and white spray paint on the back. Then its just a matter of cutting the decal from the paper, and it gluing to your panel. ([Accidental Science] suggests two-part epoxy, but cautions you make sure it does not react to the paint.)\nHe uses aluminum in this example, but theres no reason you could not choose a different substrate. Once the paper is adhered to the panel, another coat of varnish is applied to protect it. Alternatively, clear epoxy can be used as glue and varnish. The finish produced is very professional, and holds up to drilling and filing the holes in the panel.\nWed probably want to protect the edges by mounting this panel in a frame, but otherwise would be proud to put such a panel on a project that required it. We covered a similar technique before, but it required a laminator.If youre looking for alternatives, Hackaday community had a lot of ideas on how to make a panel, but if you have a method youve documented, feel free to put in the tip line.\n", "title": "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u524d\u9762\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5370\u5237\u7d19\u3068\u5857\u88c5\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u5370\u5237\u7d19\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u524d\u9762\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u308bDIY\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb", "- \u900f\u660e\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3067\u4fdd\u8b77\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

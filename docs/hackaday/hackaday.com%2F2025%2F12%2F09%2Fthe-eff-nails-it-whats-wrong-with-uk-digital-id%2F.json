For Brits the big news at the moment comes in a new digital ID scheme, something that will be required for anyone wishing to work in the country, as well as for certain government services. Its something that has attracted a lot of opposition, and now the EFF have produced an analysis\u00a0 of why they think it wont work.\nFrom the perspective of a British writer it would be easy to write screeds about the flaws in the scheme, the way it over-reaches, and about the historical distrust of Brits for their governments bureaucracy. With the parliamentary petition opposing it approaching three million signatures, theres no shortage of people who dont support it. Perhaps the most obvious thing for most of us is how unnecessary it is for its stated aim of preventing illegal immigrants from seeking employment, it neglects that we already have to show proof of right to work before being hired, and that if crooked employers ignore that they will surely also ignore the digital ID.\nIf youre reading this elsewhere in the world from where this is being written then its still of relevance, because governments like to point to other countries to justify these measures. Follow the EFF on this matter, and take note.\n\nArt: British Passport SVG by Swapnil1101, Public Domain", "title": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u5236\u5ea6\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u53cd\u767a", "body": "\u82f1\u56fd\u3067\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u5236\u5ea6\u306b\u53cd\u5bfe\u610f\u898b\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u4e0d\u8981\u3068\u306e\u58f0\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u5236\u5ea6\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u53cd\u767a", "\u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u76e3\u8996\u3068\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306e\u6226\u3044", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "\u82f1\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u653f\u5e9c\u4e0d\u4fe1\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u53cd\u5bfe\u904b\u52d5", "EFF\u306e\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u5236\u5ea6\u306f\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531"]}

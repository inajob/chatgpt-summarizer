Creator [Ivan Chebykin] is for certain a master of the dark arts.\nDigging in a bit deeper, its not strictly speaking 100% sed. A wrapper shell script is required to interface to the shell and grab the keyboard input to pass along. This is simply because sed is a stream processor, and as such it requires text to be fed into it, and it produces a text output. It has no way of reading the terminal input directly, hence the wrapper script. However, all the game logic and graphics rendering is pure sed, so thats perfectly reasonable.\nSuch programming demos are a great way to hone the finer points of various tools we use every day, whilst not being serious enough to matter if we fail. Pushing the boundaries of what can be done with these basic nuts and bolts we take for granted, is for us the very essence of software hacking, and bravo we say.\nReckon you could top this? Show us! In the meantime, heres a guide to hacking the recently released Game and Watch, and then doing the decent thing and running DOOM on it. Finally, sed is notoriously tricky to work with, so to help heres a graphical debugger to make things a little clearer."}

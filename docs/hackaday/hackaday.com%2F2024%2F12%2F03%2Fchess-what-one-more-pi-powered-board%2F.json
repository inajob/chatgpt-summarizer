That\u2019s where the real magic begins. Enter [Tamerlan Goglichidze]\u2019s Pi Board, an automated chess system that blends modern tech with age-old strategy. Inspired by Harry Potter\u2019s moving chessboard and the commercial Square Off board, [Tamerlan] re-imagines the concept using a Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, and some clever engineering. It\u2019s not just about moving pieces  it\u2019s about doing so with precision and flair.\nAt its core, the Pi Board employs an XY stepper motor grid coupled with magnets to glide chess pieces across the board. While electromagnets seemed like a promising start, [Tamerlan] found them impractical due to overheating and polarity-switching issues. Enter servo linear actuators: efficient, precise, and perfect for the job.\nBut the innovation doesn\u2019t stop there. A custom algorithm maps the 88 chess grid, allowing motors to track positions dynamically\u2014no tedious resets required. Knight movements and castling? Handled with creative coding that keeps gameplay seamless. [Tamerlan] explains it all in his sleekly designed build log.\nThough it hasnt been long since we featured a Pi-powered LED chess board, we feel that [Tamerlan]\u2019s build stands out for its ingenuity and optimization. For those still curious, we have a treasure trove of over fifty chess-themed articles from the last decade. So snuggle up during these cold winter months and read up on these evergreens!\n\n", "title": "- \u30d4\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u300cPi Board\u300d\u306f\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306b\u99d2\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d4\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3001\u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u99d2\u79fb\u52d5", "- \u30cf\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dd\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u52d5\u304f\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u99d2\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3082\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u3002Pi\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u51ac\u306e\u591c\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\u306e50\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u7279\u96c6\u8a18\u4e8b"]}

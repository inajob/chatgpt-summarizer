Despite the name, these are relatively low-frequency bands by modern standards and the antenna sizes can get a little extreme. After all, not everyone can put up an 80-meter dipole, but ham radio operators have come up with a number of interesting ways of getting on the air anyway. The only problem is that a lot of these antennas dont seem as though they should work half as well as they do, and [MIKROWAVE1] takes a look back on some of the more exotic radiators.\nHe does note that for a new ham radio operator its best to keep it simple, beginning work with a dipole, but there are still a number of options to keep the size down. A few examples are given using helically-wound vertical antennas or antennas with tuned sections of coaxial cable. From there the more esoteric antennas are explored, such as underground antennas, complex loops and other ways of making a long wire fit in a small space, and even simpler designs like throwing a weight with a piece of wire attached out the window of an apartment building.\nWhile antenna theory is certainly a good start for building antennas, a lot of the design of antennas strays into artistry and even folklore as various hams will have successes with certain types and others wont. Its not a one-size-fits-all situation so the important thing is to keep experimenting and try anything that comes to mind as long as it helps get on the air. A good starting point is [Dan Maloney]s $50 Ham Guide series, and one piece specifically dealing with HF antennas.\n\n", "title": "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u77ed\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "body": "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306f\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3002\u5927\u62b5\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4f53\u9a13\u304c\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3059\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u3057\u3066\u307f\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u95a2\u9023\u3059\u308b\u8a18\u4e8b\u306b\u306f$50\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308bHF\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u77ed\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u7279\u7570\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30a8\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30cf\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u63a2\u7d22", "\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u7c21\u7d20\u306a\u30cf\u30e0\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u6839\u5f37\u3044\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u5730\u4e0b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3068\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7", "\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff1a\u500b\u3005\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u306e\u6210\u529f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u591a\u69d8\u6027"]}

Part of what makes it all work is the six-axis IMU sensor, but the rest is the software to interpret that data and figure out what motions the user is trying to do. That happens with a Neuton.AI model and SDK, a tiny but effective machine learning framework for small devices.\nHow does it actually work? The device acts as a Bluetooth HID, and gets connected to a PC in the same was as a regular Bluetooth keyboard. Once thats done, recognized gestures are printed out the serial port as well as sent via Bluetooth to the host machine. Media can then be played, paused, volume adjusted, presentations controlled, and more. More details are on the projects GitHub repository. Theres also a demo video that explains exactly whats going on, embedded below the page break.\nMachine learning is a way of using software to solve the kinds of problems humans are not very good at writing programs to solve, and accurate gesture recognition is a good example. Not all such applications require heaps of overheating GPUs, either. Weve seen the concept of a neural network stripped down to its bare essentials running on an Arduino Uno, for those who would like to better appreciate the fundamentals.\n\n", "title": "\u300cDIY\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u611f\u77e5\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u300d- Bluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u691c\u77e5\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cDIY\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u611f\u77e5\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u300d- Bluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30e9\u30dc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Bluetooth\u3067\u30db\u30b9\u30c8PC\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u8a8d\u8b58 - IoT\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Neuton.AI\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3068SDK\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u306e\u878d\u5408 - \u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u8a8d\u8b58\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u7d10\u89e3\u304f"]}

Some of this is due to voids and imperfect layer bonding, but you can  as [Geek Detour] shows us  work around some of this. In particular, it is possible to borrow techniques from brick laying to create a pattern of alternating blocks. You can check out the video below.\nThe idea of brick layers with FDM prints was brought to the forefront earlier this year by [Stefan] of CNC Kitchen. Seven months after that video you still cant find the option for these layers in any popular slicers. Why? Because of\u00a0 a 2020 patent filed for this technique by a 3D printing company which offers this feature in its own slicer. But is this patent even valid?\nConsidering the obviousness and that FDM printing hardly began in the 2000s, its no surprise that prior art already exists in the form of a 1995 Stratasys patent. The above image shows an excerpt from the 1995 Stratasys patent, covering the drawings of FDM layers, including brick layers. This covered all such ways of printing, but the patent expired in 2016. In 2019, a PrusaSlicer ticket was opened, requesting this feature. So what happened? A second patent in 2020.\n\nThe new 2020-filed patent next to a drawing in the 1995 Stratasys patent. (Credit: Geek Detour, YouTube)\nThis 2020 patent turns out to cover effectively the same claims as the Stratasys patent. Hilariously, the 2020 patent references the Stratasys patent but proceeds to give the wrong patent ID, a pattern that persists with other referenced patents.\nClearly, the patent offices involved did not do due diligence, and this new patent is clearly invalid. Unless it is invalidated, we will have to wait until 2040 before we, too, can print brick layers with our FDM machines.\nThis isnt the first time patents have blocked 3D-printed innovation. Or given credit to the wrong inventor.\n"}

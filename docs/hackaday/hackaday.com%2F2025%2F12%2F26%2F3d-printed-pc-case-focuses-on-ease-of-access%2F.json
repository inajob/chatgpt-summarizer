However, if you want something that focuses on serviceability over flash while still looking stylish, you might like the Makeyo MK01. Its a PC case that you can print yourself, and [Marst_art] has published a video on what its like to whip one up at home.\nThe MK01 is assembled from lots of smaller parts, so the components can be made on any 3D printer that has a print area of 210 x 210 mm or more. All the outer panels are affixed to the main chassis with magnets, which makes servicing easy. You can just pop off panels when you need to get inside without undoing any fasteners or clips.\nPlus, the cool thing about the MK01 is that since youre printing it yourself, you can easily make whatever mods you like prior to printing it out. [Marst_art] notes that he threw in a USB-C port to the front panel for easy access, and a few internal mounts for 2.5 SSDs. He also made some mods to the power switch assembly. It also bears noting\u2014you get to choose your own color scheme when you make one of these. This level of customization is something you simply dont get when you buy off the shelf!\n[Marst_art]s video is a useful guide if youre planning to undertake such a build yourself. It outlines what its like to actually print one of these things on a consumer printer, and how the settings will influence the final look and feel. Its worth noting that youll probably want to print this in ABS or another filament that can handle high heat, unless youre building a\u00a0very\u00a0cool running machine.\nIts not just a great looking case, its a highly functional one, too. Files are available on Printables if youd like to make your own. Weve featured other printed cases before, too.\n\n\n"}

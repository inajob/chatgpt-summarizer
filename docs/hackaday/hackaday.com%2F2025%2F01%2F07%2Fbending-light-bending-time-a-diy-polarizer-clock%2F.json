That\u2019s just what [Mosivers], a physicist and electronics enthusiast, has done with the Polarizer Clock. It\u2019s not a perfect build, but the concept is intriguing: using polarized light and stress-induced birefringence to generate colors without resorting to RGB LEDs.\nThe clock uses white LEDs to edge-illuminate a polycarbonate plate. This light passes through two polarizers\u2014one fixed, one rotating\u2014creating constantly shifting colours. Sounds fancy, but the process involves more trial and error than you\u2019d think. [Mosivers] initially wanted to use polarizer-cut numbers but found the contrast was too weak. He experimented with materials like Tesa tape and cellophane, choosing polycarbonate for its stress birefringence.\nThe final design relies on a mix of materials, including book wrapping foil and 3D printed parts, to make things work. It has its quirks, but its certainly clever. For instance, the light dims towards the center, and the second polarizer is delicate and finicky to attach.\nThis gadget is a splendid blend of art and science, and you can see it in the video below the break. If youre inspired, you might want to look up polariscope projects, or other birefringence hacks on Hackaday.\n\n"}

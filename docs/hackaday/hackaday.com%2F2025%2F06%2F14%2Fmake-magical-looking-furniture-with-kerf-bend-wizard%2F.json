The question becomes: how much wood do I remove? And where? Thats where Kerf Bend Wizard comes to the rescue.\nMore after the break\n\nFrom spline (user input in black, expected output in pink)\nYou feed it a spline either manually or via DXFand it feeds you a cut pattern that will satisfy that spline: just enough wood removed in just the right places that the edges of the cut should touch when the bend is achieved. This means less cut time and a stronger piece than eyeballing the kerfs. It works with both a table saw blade or a tapered end mill on a CNC or manual router. You can specify the kerf width of your table saw, or angle of your end mill, along with your desired cut depth.\n to cuts \nThe output is DXF, convenient for use with a CNC, and a simple table giving distances from the edge of the piece and which side to cut, which is probably easier for use on the table saw. (Kerf Bend Wizard is happy to handle complex bends that require kerfing both sides of the material, as you can see.)\n to curved wood.\nThis was [Michael]s thesis project, for which he hopefully got a good grade. The code is semi-open according to [Michael]; theres a GitHub where you can grab an offline version for your own use, but no open-source license is on offer. Being a broke student and an artist to boot, [Michael] also cant promise he will be able to keep the web version available without ads or some kind of monetization, so enjoy it while you can!\nIf CNCs or table saws arent your thing, kerf bending has long been used with laser cutters, too.\nOur thanks (which, as always, is worth its weight in gold) to [Michael] for the tip. If youre in the intersection of the Venn diagram with [Michael], wed love to hear what youre up to."}

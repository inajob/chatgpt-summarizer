Think you dont have ample room for a model train layout at your place? You may not be thinking small enough. [Peter Waldraff] knows a thing or two about hiding train layouts inside of furniture (thats one solution), but this time, hes built a track in plain sight thats meant to sit on the bookshelf. The whole thing is just 5.5 x 12.\nThis N-scale layout was three years in the making, mostly because [Peter] was waiting for just the right little powered chassis to come along. For the layout, [Peter] started by creating custom flexible track by removing pieces with a sharp knife. He glued down the track to pink foam and used nails to hold it in place while the glue dried. He also built a wood frame around the base to stabilize it and hold some of the electronic components, including a switch made from an old ballpoint pen.\nThen it was time to start decorating the thing, beginning with a couple of buildings made from more pink foam that are both lit up with LEDs. Eventually, [Peter] added a bunch of details like streetlights, animals, and garbage cans that really make the layout pop. As far as the engine goes, [Peter] picked up a Tomytec TM-TR02 on eBay and built a trolley out of two broken cars. [Peter]s build is something you just have to see for yourself  fortunately for you, the build and demo video is after the break.\nLike we said, [Peter]s usual territory is hiding train layouts in end tables and coffee tables and the like, so its nice to see what he can do given different constraints.\n\n", "title": "\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30d5\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u9244\u9053\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u304c\u672c\u68da\u306b\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023\u5e74\u304b\u304b\u308a\u3001LED\u4ed8\u304d\u30d3\u30eb\u3084\u52d5\u7269\u3001\u30b4\u30df\u7bb1\u306a\u3069\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30d5\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u9244\u9053\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1", "\u72ed\u3044\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308bN\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3 - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c", "LED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u7167\u3089\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u8857\u4e26\u307f - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306e\u9244\u9053\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8", "\u53e4\u3044\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30da\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u304c\u7279\u5fb4 - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u9244\u9053\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u96a0\u308c\u305f\u9244\u9053\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306f\u4eca\u56de\u9055\u3063\u305f - \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30ef\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30d5\u304c\u9b45\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1"]}

Think you dont have ample room for a model train layout at your place? You may not be thinking small enough. [Peter Waldraff] knows a thing or two about hiding train layouts inside of furniture (thats one solution), but this time, hes built a track in plain sight thats meant to sit on the bookshelf. The whole thing is just 5.5 x 12.\nThis N-scale layout was three years in the making, mostly because [Peter] was waiting for just the right little powered chassis to come along. For the layout, [Peter] started by creating custom flexible track by removing pieces with a sharp knife. He glued down the track to pink foam and used nails to hold it in place while the glue dried. He also built a wood frame around the base to stabilize it and hold some of the electronic components, including a switch made from an old ballpoint pen.\nThen it was time to start decorating the thing, beginning with a couple of buildings made from more pink foam that are both lit up with LEDs. Eventually, [Peter] added a bunch of details like streetlights, animals, and garbage cans that really make the layout pop. As far as the engine goes, [Peter] picked up a Tomytec TM-TR02 on eBay and built a trolley out of two broken cars. [Peter]s build is something you just have to see for yourself  fortunately for you, the build and demo video is after the break.\nLike we said, [Peter]s usual territory is hiding train layouts in end tables and coffee tables and the like, so its nice to see what he can do given different constraints.\n\n"}

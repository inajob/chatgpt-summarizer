[Mithuna Yoganathan] explains this conundrum in more detail than you probably got in your high school physics class.\nWhile quantum physics has been around for over a century, it can still be a bit tricky to wrap ones head around since some of the behaviors of energy and matter at such a small scale arent what wed expect based on our day-to-day experiences. In classical optics, for instance, a brighter light has more energy, and a greater amplitude of its electromagnetic wave. But, when it comes to ejecting an electron from a material via the photoelectric effect, if your wavelength of light is above a certain threshold (bigger wavelengths are less energetic), then nothing happens no matter how bright the light is.\nScientists pondered this for some time until the early 20th Century when Max Planck and Albert Einstein theorized that electromagnetic waves could only release energy in packets of energy, or photons. These quanta can be approximated as particles, but as [Yoganathan] explains, thats not exactly whats happening. Despite taking a few classes in quantum mechanics, I still learned something from this video myself. I definitely appreciate her including a failed experiment as anyone who has worked in a lab knows happens all the time. Science is never as tidy as its portrayed on TV.\nIf you want to do some quantum mechanics experiments at home (hopefully with more luck than [Yoganathan]), then how about trying to measure Plancks Constant with a multimeter or LEGO? If youre wondering how you might better explain electromagnetism to others, maybe this museum exhibit will be inspiring.\n\n", "title": "\u5149\u5b50\uff1a\u5149\u306e\u7c92\u5b50\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6027\u8cea\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "\u5149\u5b50\u306f\u5149\u306e\u7c92\u5b50\u3001\u6ce2\u3001\u307e\u305f\u306f\u305d\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u30df\u30b9\u30ca\u30fb\u30e8\u30ac\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u3053\u306e\u96e3\u554f\u3092\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5149\u5b50\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044\u306f\u3001\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u65e5\u5e38\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u4e88\u60f3\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u5834\u5408\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u306f\u7406\u89e3\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u5149\u5b50\uff1a\u5149\u306e\u7c92\u5b50\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6027\u8cea\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac", "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u3068\u5149\u5b50\uff1a\u7d20\u7c92\u5b50\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u3055", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30f3\uff1a\u5149\u5b50\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7406\u8ad6", "\u5149\u3068\u7269\u8cea\u306e\u632f\u308b\u821e\u3044\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u4e16\u754c", "\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u5b9a\u6570\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

In the Dutch video after the break, he builds a transforming backpack with two electric ducted fans (EDFs), and takes to the bike paths.\nAn EDF moves a small volume of air at high velocity, which doesnt make them great for low speed applications. But theyre nice and compact, and safer than large propellers. [Emiel] didnt skimp on the rest of the hardware, with the motors attached to metal 3D printed arms, mounted on a machined aluminum steel plate.\n\nThe arms were printed courtesy of a sponsor, and created via generative design in Fusion 360 to make them both light and strong. A pair of large servos swing the arms up, while smaller servos rotate the motors into the horizontal position. The arm servos are controlled by an Arduino, and activated by a simple toggle switch attached to the backpacks shoulder strap. A wireless remote similar to that of an electric skateboard is used to control the EDFs.\nFitted in a [Emiel]s old backpack, the result looks somewhat innocuous (if you dont look too closely) until it unfolds its hidden power\u2014twin jets ready to blast away any pesky headwinds with the push of a button. Its a fun solution that is sure to attract attention, and a great excuse to create heavy duty mechanics.\n\n"}

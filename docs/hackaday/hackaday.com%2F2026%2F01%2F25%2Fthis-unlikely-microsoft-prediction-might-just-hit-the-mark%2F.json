Its an easy win, after all, the dominant player in the PC operating system market has a long history of dunking on free software, and lets face it, todays Windows doesnt offer a good experience. But what might the future hold? [Mason] has an unexpected prediction: that Microsoft will eventually move towards offering a Windows-themed Linux distro instead of a descendant of todays Windows.\nThe very idea is sure to cause mirth, but on a little sober reflection, its not such a crazy one. Windows 11 is slow and unfriendly, and increasingly its losing the position once enjoyed by its ancestors. The desktop (or laptop) PC is no longer the default computing experience, and what to do about that must be a big headache for the Redmond company. Even gaming, once a stronghold for Windows, is being lost to competitors such as Valves Steam OS, so it wouldnt be outlandish for them to wonder whether the old embrace-and-extend strategy could be tried on the Linux desktop.\nWe do not possess a working crystal ball here at Hackaday, so well hold off hailing a Microsoft desktop Linux. But we have to admit its not an impossible future, having seen Apple reinvent their OS in the past using BSD, and even Microsoft bring out a cloud Linux distro. If you cant wait, youll have to make do with a Windows skin, WINE, and the .NET runtime on your current Linux box.", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3001Windows\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bLinux\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u304b\uff1f", "body": "Microsoft\u304c\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306bWindows\u98a8\u306eLinux\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3001Windows\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306bLinux\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u304b\uff1f", "- Windows 11\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u7af6\u4e89\u6fc0\u5316\u3001Windows\u306e\u7acb\u5834\u306f\u63fa\u3089\u3050", "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6226\u7565\uff1fLinux\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- Windows\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306b\u3057\u305fLinux\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d6e\u4e0a\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

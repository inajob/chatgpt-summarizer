It costs about $13 plus the cost of making the PCB. It operates at 18 million samples per second. It also doesnt need any software  you connect to it with your browser! It works as an oscilloscope, a logic analyzer, and a waveform generator. Not bad. The board is basically a little life support around a PIC32MK and the software required to run it.\nOf course, for $13, you need to temper your expectations. One analog input reads from -6 to 6V (hint: use a 10X probe). The goal was for the instrument to be accurate within 2%.\u00a0 There are also nine digital inputs sampled simultaneously with the analog sampling. The signal generator portion can output a 4 MHz square wave or a 40 kHz arbitrary waveform.\n\nIf you need more channels, the board can cooperate with other boards, which is interesting  who doesnt want a scope you can add a new channel to for $13 each? The little board also has a Basic programming system built-in that includes an editor, compiler, debugger, and file system so that you can script the entire thing that way.\nHonestly, we arent sure using this as a scope appeals to us as much as using it as a building block for other things. The fact that you can chain them and it has its own web interface means you could probably build some interesting things with it. [Richard] notes that he has one controlling his reflow toaster oven, for example.\nYou can find similar offerings commercially that have better specifications but, naturally, they dont cost under $20. Creating a simple logic analyzer is fairly easy with todays high-performance CPUs, but there are still a few details to consider regarding stability and triggering."}

I believe thats the case with this tiny media control bar from [likeablob] that uses an ESP32-C3 Super Mini.\nImage by [likeablob] via Hackaday.IOFrom left to right youve got a meta key that allows double functions for all the other keys. The base functions are play/pause, previous track, and next track while the knob handles volume.\nAnd because it uses this Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, it can seamlessly integrate with Home Assistant via ESPHome.\nWhat else is under the hood? Four low-profile Cherry MX Browns and a rotary encoder underneath that nicely-printed knob.\nIf you want to build one of these for yourself, all the files are available on GitHub including the customizable enclosure which [likeablob] designed with OpenSCAD.\nPortable Endgame, If It Exists\nPerhaps [Palpatine]s one mistake in creating this 36-key portable endgame is believing in the idea of the endgame in the first place. But Im not here to judge.\nImage by [Palpatine] via redditOh wait, yes I am! I really like this keyboard, and I think it would look right at home on the desk of the centerfold below it, although its supposed to be a go-anywhere contraption. Be sure to check out the gallery on this one to see it folded together for transport.\nIt would seem that [Palpatine] learned some nice tricks while designing this keyboard. Have you heard of 10440 batteries? Theyre 3.7 V and usually cheaper than the square Li-Po batteries of the same size.\nThis bad boy is based on the Seeed Xiao nRF52840, which [Palpatine] believes is worth spending a little bit of extra money on instead of nice!nano clones, while being cheaper than an actual nice!nano would be.\nAs far as open-sourceness goes, [Palpatine] seems willing to share their design files, although they dont seem to have been published anywhere at this time.\nThe Centerfold: White Light Might Bite At Night\nImage by [Embarrased-Yak-3766] via redditSo this one isnt quite as wide as usual, but its definitely more white than usual. I suppose that wiiiide monitor makes up for the missing pixels.\nWhat do you think? Crisp and clean, or cold and clinical? I cant decide. I definitely feel snowbound vibes, and I want to sleep in.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Munson\nImage by [Martin Howard] via Antique TypewritersThe delight of the Munson typewriter is in the exposed internal workings, which come to life when the machine is in use. Those octagonal key tops arent too shabby, either.\nYou may have noticed that this machine has no typebars. Instead, it uses a horizontal cylinder about the size of a finger. The cylinder slides from side to side and rotates to find the chosen character. Then a hammer strikes from behind the paper, pushing it against the ribbon and the type cylinder.\nMuch like the later IBM Selectrics and the daisy wheel machines of the 1970s and 80s, one could easily change the font by swapping out the all-steel type cylinder. The Munson has two Shift keys, one for upper case and another for figures, so only three rows of keys are needed.\nThe Munson came out in 1890 and was well-received. It won the highest medal awarded at the Worlds Fair Chicago, 1893, but the machines are hard to find these days. Eight years after its introduction, the design of the Munson was acquired by the Chicago Writing Machine Co. and rebranded the Chicago.\nFinally, the MingKwai Typewriter Emerges From Obscurity\nSo you get a Historical Clackers two-fer this week; lucky you! After more than half a century, this fascinating Chinese typewriter turned up while a couple was cleaning out her grandfathers basement in New York.\nJennifer Felix and her husband Nelson posted photos on a Facebook group trying to ID the machine. A flurry of enthusiastic comments flooded the forum, with many people offering to buy the machine.\nPhoto by Elisabeth von Boch, courtesy of Stanford Libraries; image via This Is Colossal\nAs it turns out, its a MingKwai  the only one in existence. And its now in the hands of Stanford Libraries.\nThis machine was invented in 1947 by a writer, translator, and linguist named Lin Yutang. The MingKwai, which means clear and fast, was the first compact concept Chinese typewriter to have a keyboard that was capable of producing 80,000+ characters.\nHow is that even possible? Mechanical sort and search. Seriously! Check this out: the 72-key board is made up of strokes and shapes, and the characters are arranged in linear order, like an English dictionary. To use it, you would press one of the 36 top keys and one of the 28 bottom keys simultaneously. This triggered a series of rotations in the internals and would bring eight characters into view in a small window that Lin called the magic eye. Finally, you would choose your desired character using the numbered keys in the bottom row.\nThe only known prototype was built by the Carl E. Krum company. Lin was unable to drum up commercial interest to produce it at scale, so he sold the rights and the prototype to Mergenthaler Linotype Company, where Jennifer Felixs grandfather worked as a machinist. So it never went into production, and the prototype went home with with Grandpa.\n\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two.

Every time they change filaments, theyve got to purge the single nozzle, which results in a huge number of technicolor purge poops which on some machines are even ejected out a chute at the back of the printer. The jokes practically write themselves.\nWhats not a joke, though, is the sheer mass of plastic waste this can produce. [Stefan] from CNC Kitchen managed to generate over a kilo of printer poop for a 500-gram multi-color print. So he set about looking for ways to turn printer poops back into filament, with interesting results. The tests are based around a commercial lab-scale filament extruder, a 3Devo Composer, but should apply to almost any filament extruder, even the homebrew ones. A few process tips quickly became evident. First, purge poops are too big and stringy (ick) to feed directly into a filament extruder, so shredding was necessary.\nSecond, everything needs to be very clean  no cross-contamination with plastics other than PLA, no metal bits in the chopped-up plastic bits, and most importantly, no water contamination. [Stefan]s first batch of recycled filament came from purge poops that had been sitting around a while, and sucked a lot of water vapor from the air. A treatment in a heated vacuum chamber seems to help, but what worked best was using purge poops hot and fresh from a print run. Again, ick.\n[Stefan] eventually got a process down that produced decent, usable filament that would jam the printer or result in poor print quality. It even had a pretty nice color, which of course is totally dependent on the mix of colors you start with. Granted, not everyone has access to a fancy filament extruder like his, so this may not be practical for everyone, but it at least shows that theres a path to reducing the waste stream from any printer, especially multi-material ones.\n\n", "title": "1\u30ad\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "1\u3064\u306e\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u3067\u884c\u3046\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u76f4\u5f8c\u306e\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u51e6\u7406\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1\u30ad\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u306e\u524a\u6e1b", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u518d\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

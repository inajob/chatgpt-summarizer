But if even two dimensions is a bit more than youre looking to tackle, [mircemk] shows how you can distill the core gameplay of this iconic title to its absolute minimum using an Arduino and a row of LEDs.\nWhile [mircemk] brings their usual design aesthetic and flash to the project, this one could truly be done as a parts bin build. All you really need is a microcontroller with enough I/O pins (here, an Arduino Nano is used), a couple of buttons, and the aforementioned LEDs. A 162 LCD and a buzzer have been added to improve on the user interface a bit, but even that isnt strictly required.\nTo play, each user holds their button and gets ready to hit it as soon as the LED closest to them lights up. Again, [mircemk] spruces this build up by offering both integrated buttons on the front panel of the game, as well as a pair of external controllers so you dont have to crowd around the main unit. In this incarnation the score is shown on the LCD, but swapping that out for a pair of seven-segment LEDs could give the whole thing a bit more of a retro flair.\nThis isnt the first time [mircemk] has tackled 1D Pong  if you can spring for addressable LEDs, you can pull the whole thing off with significantly less wiring.\n\n\n", "title": "Arduino\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a1\u6b21\u5143Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Arduino\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u306b\u307e\u3067\u7c21\u7565\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u306e\u306f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3001LED\u3067\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u304cLED\u304c\u70b9\u706f\u3057\u305f\u3089\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Arduino\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a1\u6b21\u5143Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "Arduino\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f5c\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30eb\u306a1D Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308bArduino\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e1\u6b21\u5143Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "1D Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bArduino\u3068LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f1D Pong\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0"]}

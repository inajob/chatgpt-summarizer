In fact, theyve become downright boring. Desktop, laptop, or mobile, theyre all more or less featureless slabs of various dimensions. Theres not even much in the way of color variation  the classic beige box is now available with white, black, or metallic finishes.\nBelieving that such a pedestrian appearance isnt befitting a device that puts the worlds collected knowledge at our fingertips, [Keegan McNamara] started exploring a more luxurious approach to computing. Gone is the mass produced injection molded plastic, in its place is hand-carved maple and Tuscan leather. Common computing form factors are eschewed entirely for a swooping console inspired by fine furniture and classic sports cars. The final result, called the Mythic I, is equal parts art and science. Not just a bold reimaging of what a computer can be, but an object to be displayed and discussed.\nCarving the enclosure with hand tools.\nThe write-up [Keegan] has prepared is a fascinating treatise on modern design and metaphysics that gives a unique insight into the thought process that went into the Mythic I computer. Those looking for slightly more technical details can check out the accompanying post on the forevercomputer mailing list.\nUnfortunately we werent able to find any internal shots of the construction, but the mailing list post at least explained that its powered by an Intel NUC running a minimal Linux system which includes little more than wordgrinder. Sorry, the vi and emacs debate will have to go somewhere else.\nNetworking has been disabled to provide a distraction-free writing experience, though frankly, wed have thought getting dumped into a Bash prompt at boot would already provide such an environment. To get files off of the system, [Keegan] wrote up a few scripts to simplify moving documents to and from a USB flash drive.\nThis isnt the first time weve seen somebody attempt to create a more visually appealing desktop computer, but its certainly\u00a0 one of the most attractive and professionally done specimens to have graced these pages."}

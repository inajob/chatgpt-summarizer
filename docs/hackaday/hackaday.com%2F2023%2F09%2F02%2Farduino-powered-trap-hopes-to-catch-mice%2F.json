However, you can still learn a lot building your own, as this project from [ROBO HUB] demonstrates.\nThe trap is intended to catch mice in a humane fashion, without injury to the animal. To that end, it uses an Arduino Nano armed with an ultrasonic distance sensor\u00a0 to detect when mice have entered a plastic container. The containers hinged door is is held open with a servo. When a mouse is detected, the servo trips the door to snap shut under the power of an elastic band.\nThe key to making this design work well is ensuring that there are no gaps in the closed container that the mouse can use to escape. Theyre wily creatures able to squeeze through positively tiny spaces, so its important to get this right. Besides that, you want to check the trap regularly, lest any caught mice simply claw and chew their way out.\nWeve seen a few mousetraps around these parts before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

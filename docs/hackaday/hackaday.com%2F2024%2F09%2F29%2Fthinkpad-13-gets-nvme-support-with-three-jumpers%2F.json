Such is the case with the Lenovo ThinkPad 13  its got a M.2 M-key socket, yet somehow only supports SATA SSDs in it, despite the CPU being new enough to support both SATA and NVMe effortlessly. [treble] got one of those laptops from a recycler, and decided to figure out just what this laptops deal is.\nArmed with schematics, she and her friend looked at the M.2 implementation. The slots schematic sure looked ready to support either kind of drive, a surprising find. Heres the catch  Lenovo only populated components for SATA drive support. All you need to switch from SATA to NVMe support is three magnet wire jumpers, or zero-ohm 0402 resistors, and voila; you can now use the significantly cheaper kind of M.2 drives in your ThinkPad.\nAll is documented, and [treble] even mentions that you could increase the link speed by adding more PCIe lane capacitors that Lenovo, again, left unsoldered. UEFI already has the modules needed to boot from NVMe, too  its an outright upgrade for your laptop with just a soldering irons touch required, and a reminder that proprietary tech will screw you over for entirely arbitrary reasons. Now, its not just laptops you can upgrade with a few resistors  same goes for certain electric cars.", "title": "Lenovo ThinkPad 13\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u9650\u3092\u7a81\u7834\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "ThinkPad 13\u306fSATA SSD\u306e\u307f\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001CPU\u306fSATA\u3068NVMe\u306e\u53cc\u65b9\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u4e21\u65b9\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001Lenovo\u306fSATA\u306e\u307f\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u30023\u3064\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070NVMe\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002UEFI\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u5358\u306b\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Lenovo ThinkPad 13\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5236\u9650\u3092\u7a81\u7834\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "SATA SSD\u304b\u3089NVMe SSD\u3078\u306e\u5909\u66f4\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\uff01Lenovo ThinkPad 13\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5", "NVMe\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eM.2\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306b\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\u3068\u30bd\u30eb\u30c0\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ab\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u624b\u9806"]}

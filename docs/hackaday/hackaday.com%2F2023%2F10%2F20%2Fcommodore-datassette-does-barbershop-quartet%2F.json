[Linus \u00c5kesson] modified a Commodore Datassette player to move its mouth and, when quadrupled, sing a clever barbershop tune called Sweet End of Line thats a play on Sweet Adeline, a top hit from the summer of 1903.\n What? Let us explain. Those with Commodore 64s who lacked disk drives often had the Datassette  a magnetic storage tape device, or cassette player used to load and save files. But they couldnt open the doors themselves with a keypress, and they certainly couldnt sing barbershop.\nFirst off, [Linus] redirected the current that drives the magnetizing tape head through a speaker coil instead. Then he replaced the motor with a servo that opens the lid from the inside. A simple rubber band pulls the lid back shut. Software-wise, [Linus] is using a timer interrupt to run code that toggles the output signal, the rate of which determines the pitch.\nDont worry  all of these modifications are reversible, so no Datassettes were truly harmed in the making. Dont forget to check out the brief build/demo video after the break.\nWeve seen our share of tape players, but wed never seen one with a crank until recently.\n\n"}

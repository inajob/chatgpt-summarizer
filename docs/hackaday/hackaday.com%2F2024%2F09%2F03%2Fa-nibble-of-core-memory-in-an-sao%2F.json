Not least [Andy Geppert], whos made a nibble, four bits of it, complete with interactive LED illumination to show state. Best of all, its on a badge Simple Add-On (SAO) for fun and games at your next hacker con.\nAside from it being a fun project, perhaps the most interesting part comes in the GitHub repository, where can be found the schematic for the device. Hes built all the drive and sense circuitry himself rather than finding an old-stock core memory driver chip, which gives those of us whove never worked with this stuff the chance to understand how it works. Beyond that it takes input from the Stemma or SAO ports to a GPIO expander, which provides all the lines necessary to drive it all.\nTo show it in action hes posted a video which weve placed below. If youre hungry for more, its not [Andy]s first outing into core memory.\n\n"}

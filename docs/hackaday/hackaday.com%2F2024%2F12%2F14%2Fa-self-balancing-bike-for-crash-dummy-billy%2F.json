Building sufficient gyros to keep the bike stable required quite a bit of trial and error.\nThere are some tricks to getting a stable heavy weight to rotate without a lot of vibration and problems. The gyros go on the riders saddle, so you arent going to be able to ride in the normal fashion. However, a substantial motor drives the wheels so theres no need to peddle.\nThe first attempt to self-balance stayed stable for about 10 seconds. Some of it was fine-tuning code, but noise from the gyros also threw off the angle sensor. A higher-quality sensor seemed promising, but it didnt really fix the problem. Instead of using PID, the guys tried an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) algorithm. Once that was sorted and a servo allowed for steering, it was time to let the bike roam free.\n\nThen disaster struck as the bike lost its cool in a parking lot, causing damage. After repairs, they found issues that confused the angle sensor. They didnt have the stomach to fit a third sensor onboard, so they put Billy the Crash Dummy onboard and decided to try to run him and the bike off a ramp. That didnt exactly work out, though. After two attempts, the bike was effectively totaled, although Billy seems to have survived with no more than a bruised ego.\nWe were dismayed that they didnt really complete the project, but it does seem like they learned a lot, and maybe that will help someone else out in the future.\nWe have seen working bikes before. We also have seen some truly strange bike projects.\n"}

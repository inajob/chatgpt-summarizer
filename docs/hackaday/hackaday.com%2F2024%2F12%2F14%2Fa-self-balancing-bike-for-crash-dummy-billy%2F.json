Building sufficient gyros to keep the bike stable required quite a bit of trial and error.\nThere are some tricks to getting a stable heavy weight to rotate without a lot of vibration and problems. The gyros go on the riders saddle, so you arent going to be able to ride in the normal fashion. However, a substantial motor drives the wheels so theres no need to peddle.\nThe first attempt to self-balance stayed stable for about 10 seconds. Some of it was fine-tuning code, but noise from the gyros also threw off the angle sensor. A higher-quality sensor seemed promising, but it didnt really fix the problem. Instead of using PID, the guys tried an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) algorithm. Once that was sorted and a servo allowed for steering, it was time to let the bike roam free.\n\nThen disaster struck as the bike lost its cool in a parking lot, causing damage. After repairs, they found issues that confused the angle sensor. They didnt have the stomach to fit a third sensor onboard, so they put Billy the Crash Dummy onboard and decided to try to run him and the bike off a ramp. That didnt exactly work out, though. After two attempts, the bike was effectively totaled, although Billy seems to have survived with no more than a bruised ego.\nWe were dismayed that they didnt really complete the project, but it does seem like they learned a lot, and maybe that will help someone else out in the future.\nWe have seen working bikes before. We also have seen some truly strange bike projects.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u7acb\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b66\u3073", "body": "\u81ea\u7acb\u8d70\u884c\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b66\u3073\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u7acb\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u5b66\u3073", "\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30ed\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u5b89\u5b9a\u5316\u6280\u8853", "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u304c\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u8a66\u307f\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6559\u8a13", "\u8d70\u884c\u4e2d\u306e\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3068\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30c0\u30df\u30fc\u306e\u58ee\u7d76\u306a\u5192\u967a", "\u81ea\u7acb\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u3068\u672a\u6765\u3078\u306e\u5e0c\u671b"]}

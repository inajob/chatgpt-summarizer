Click-through for the notes or check out the video below the break for the one hour talk itself.\nThe talk is about Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) which is the backbone for radio telecommunications these days. [Joshua] tries to take an intuitive view (rather than a mathematical view) of working in the frequency domain, and trying to figure out how to get what OFDM is (and why its so important). [Joshua] sent his talk in to us in the hope that it would be useful for all skill levels, both folks who are new to radio and signal processing, and folks who are well experienced in working in the frequency domain.\nIf you think youve seen The Unreasonable Effectiveness of $TOPIC before, thats because hackers cant help but riff on the original The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, wherein a scientist wonders why it is that mathematical methods work at all. They seem to, but how? Or why? Will they always continue to work? Its a mystery.\nHidden away in the notes and at the end of his presentation, [Joshua] notes that every year he watches The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Most Ingenious Algorithm Ever? and every year he understands a little more.\nIf youre interested in OFDM be sure to check out AI Listens To Radio.\n\n"}

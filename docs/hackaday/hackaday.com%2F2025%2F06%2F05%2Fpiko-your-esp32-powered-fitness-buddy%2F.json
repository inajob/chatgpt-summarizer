Made from an ESP32 Beetle C6 and using an attached accelerometer with simple thresholds the Piko can detect if youre idle, walking, jogging, or sprinting; and at the same time count your steps.\n\nThe team 3D printed the requisite parts in PLA using the printer in their university makerspace. In addition to the ESP32 and printed parts, the bill of materials includes a 240240 IPS TFT LCD display, a LIS331HH triple-axis accelerometer, a 200 mAh battery, and of course, a watch strap.\nDemonstrating splendid attention to detail, and inspired by the aesthetic of the Tamagotchi and pixel art, the Piko mimics your current activity with a delightful array of hand-drawn animations on its display. Should you want to bring a similar charm to your own projects, all the source is available under the MIT license.\nIf youre interested in smartwatch technology be sure to check out our recent articles: Smartwatches Could Flatten The Curve Of The Next Pandemic and Custom Smartwatch Makes Diabetes Monitoring Easier For Kids.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u300cPiko\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u300cPiko\u300d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u300cPiko\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d3\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u8b58\u5225\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u30cd\u30b9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb", "- \u5927\u5b66\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1", "- \u624b\u63cf\u304d\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306e\u300cPiko\u300d\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "- MIT\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u30ce\u30a6\u30cf\u30a6"]}

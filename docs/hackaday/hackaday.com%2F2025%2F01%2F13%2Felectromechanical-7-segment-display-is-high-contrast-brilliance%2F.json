You can build a seven-segment display out of moving parts, too. [tin-foil-hat] has achieved just that with a remarkably elegant design.\nAs you might expect, the build relies heavily on 3D-printed components\u2014produced in white and black plastic to create a high-contrast display. Its a simple choice that makes the display easy to read in a wide variety of lighting conditions, and far less fussy than toying with LEDs and diffusers and all that.\nActuation of each display segment is achieved electromagnetically. Effectively, each segment behaves like a flip dot, with the orientation controlled by energizing one of two electromagnets per segment. Controlling the electromagnets is an ESP32, which is hooked up to the various segments via a Darlington transistor array, with multiplexing used to minimize the number of IO pins required. A shift register was also employed to let the microcontroller easily drive four of these electromechanical digits.\nIts a simple build, well explained\u2014and the final result is aesthetically pleasing. Weve seen a few builds along these lines before, albeit using altogether different techniques.\u00a0Lots of different techniques, in fact! Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Archivort for the tip!]"}

That said, lasers are also extremely dangerous, as their highly focused nature and wide range of power levels can leave a person dazzled, blinded or dead from direct and indirect exposure. A lapse in laser safety was how [Phil Broughton] ended up with part of his retina forever marked, as he describes his adventures with an overly enthusiastic laser company sales person.\nQuanta Ray PRO350 with frequency doubling, emitting a 532 nm beam \u2013 Sales brochure image from Quanta Ray, unknown date\nIt didnt take much, just this sales person who made a really poor decision while trying to please some customers and nearly ended with multiple adults, a local school, pilots at a nearby airfield getting their retinas blasted out due to an absolutely harebrained idea to use a fairly high-powered Quanta-Ray Nd:YAG laser on reflective surfaces in the open.\nThis was in 1999, and fortunately [Phil] only suffered some fairly minor damage to his retina from the laser beam reflection. What happened to the customers (who wore argon laser safety glasses) or the sales critter (who left soon after) is not described, but both may have received some bad news when they had their eyes checked shortly after after at the ophthalmologist.\nThese kind of stories are a stark reminder that laser safety is not optional. Lasers producing a visible (400  700 nm) wavelength above Class 2 should only be operated in a fully secured environment, with safety glasses for the appropriate laser wavelength. Class 2 lasers producing a non-visible wavelength can cause permanent damage because the blink reflex of the eye does not offer any protection here.\nAs even some dodgy laser pointers are being (illegally) sold online are actually Class 2, this should make it clear that laser eye injury can happen to anyone, and it only takes a second to change someones life forever.", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027: \u76ee\u3092\u50b7\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u51fa\u6765\u4e8b", "body": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u732b\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u3055\u305b\u305f\u308a\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u6750\u6599\u3092\u5f6b\u523b\u30fb\u5207\u65ad\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5371\u967a\u3002\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6027\u3068\u5e83\u7bc4\u56f2\u306a\u51fa\u529b\u7bc4\u56f2\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u4eba\u3005\u306f\u76f4\u63a5\u30fb\u9593\u63a5\u306e\u9732\u51fa\u306b\u3088\u308a\u7729\u3057\u304f\u3001\u76f2\u76ee\u3001\u3042\u308b\u3044\u306f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u6b20\u5982\u306f\u8ca9\u58f2\u54e1\u3068\u306e\u885d\u7a81\u3092\u62db\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027: \u76ee\u3092\u50b7\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u51fa\u6765\u4e8b", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u6271\u3046\u3068\u304d\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u904e\u3061\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u4e8b\u6545", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3044\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

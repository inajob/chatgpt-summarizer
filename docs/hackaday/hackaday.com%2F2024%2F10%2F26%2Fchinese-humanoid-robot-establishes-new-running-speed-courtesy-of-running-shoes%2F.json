Its therefore little wonder that replicating bipedal walking (and running) in robotics is taking a while. Recently a Chinese humanoid robot managed to bump up the maximum running speed to 3.6 m/s (12.96 km/h), during a match between two of Robot Eras STAR1 humanoid robots in the Gobi desert.\nFor comparison, the footspeed of humans during a marathon is around 20 km/h and significantly higher with a sprint. These humanoid robots did a 34 minute run, with an interesting difference being that one was equipped with running shoes, which helped it reach these faster speeds. Clearly the same reasons which has led humans to start adopting footwear since humankinds hunter-gatherer days  including increased grip and traction  also apply to humanoid robots.\nThat said, it looks like the era when humans can no longer outrun humanoid robots is still a long time off.\n\n"}

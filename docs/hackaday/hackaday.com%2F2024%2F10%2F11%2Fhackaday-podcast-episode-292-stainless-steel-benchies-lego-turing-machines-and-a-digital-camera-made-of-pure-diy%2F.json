If there was a theme this week, it was long-term projects, like the multiple years one hacker spent going down dead ends in the quest for DIY metal 3D printing. Not to be outdone, another hacker spent seven years building a mirrorless digital camera that looks like a commercial product. And getting a solderless PCB to do the blinkenlight thing took a long time too.\nLooking to eliminate stringing in your 3D prints? Then youll want to avoid the pause and attach approach, which intentionally creates strings in your prints. Wondering if you can 3D print bearings? You can, but you probably shouldnt unless you have a particular use in mind. And what happens when you have an infinitely large supply of Lego? Why, you build a Turing machine on steroids, of course.\nFinally, we take a look at this weeks Cant-Miss articles with a look into plastic recycling and why we cant have nice things yet, and we take a trip out into orbit and examine the ins and outs of Lagrange points.\nAnd a little mea culpa from the editing desk: Sorry the podcast is coming out late this week. Audacity ate my files. If youre ever in a similar circumstance, you can probably halfway save your bacon with audacity-project-tools. Ask me how I know.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the zero-calorie MP3.\n\nEpisode 292 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nThe Internet Archive Has Been Hacked\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nIt was an old treadle Singer sewing machine, guessed correctly by [Charlie].\u00a0 Congrats!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nAn Open Source Mirrorless Camera You\u2019d Want To Use\nFirst Benchies In Stainless Steel, With Lasers\n\nEnder 3 Meets MIG Welder To Make A Metal Benchy \u2014 Kind Of\n\n\nSee The \u201cPause-and-Attach\u201d Technique For 3D Printing In Action\n\n3D Printed String Vase Shows What\u2019s Possible\nIntentional Filament Stringing Helps Santa Soar\nWonderful Foldable Printable Dodecahedron\n\n\nThe Turing Machine Made Real, In LEGO\n\nTMD-1 Makes Turing Machine Concepts Easy To Understand\nTMD-2: A Bigger, Better, More Collaborative Turing Machine\nTMD-3: Clever Hall Sensor Hack Leads To Better Turing Demo\n\n\nTowards Solderless PCB Prototyping\n\nOpen Source Pick And Place Has A $450 BOM Cost\n(Re)designing The LumenPnP Tape Feeder\n\n\n3D Printed Bearings With Filament Rollers\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nFail Of The Week: The Case Of The Curiously Colored Streetlights\nThat\u2019ll Go Over Like A Cement Airplane\nWhat Happened To Duracell PowerCheck?\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nThe Piezoelectric Glitching Attack\nGPS Tracking In The Trackless Land\nV-Cut Vias Test Your Whole Panel At Once\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nLagrange Points And Why You Want To Get Stuck At Them\nRecycling Tough Plastics Into Precursors With Some Smart Catalyst Chemistry\n\nBig Chemistry Series\n\n\n", "title": "DIY\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1", "body": "10\u6708\u3001Hackaday Podcast\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9292\u306e\u8981\u7d04\uff1aDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff083D\u5370\u5237\u3001\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3001Turing\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\uff09\u3001PCB\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30013D\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3001\u6280\u8853\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3001\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3001\u5b87\u5b99Lagrange\u70b9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002podcast\u9045\u5ef6\u306e\u8b1d\u7f6a\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0: \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1", "\u93e1\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9: 7\u5e74\u306e\u6b73\u6708", "\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u306a\u304f\u3059: 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30ec\u30b4\u7248\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u672a\u6765: \u30ca\u30a4\u30b9\u306a\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7406\u7531"]}

Thats not to say you cant build one yourself though, as [Toast] did in a very creative fashion.\nAfter being inspired by so many typewriters on YouTube, [Toast] decided they simply had to 3D print one of their own design. They decided to go in a unique direction, eschewing ink ribbons for carbon paper as the source of ink. To create a functional typewriter, they had to develop a typebar mechanism to imprint the paper, as well as a mechanism to move the paper along during typing. The weird thing is the letter selection\u2014the typewriter doesnt have a traditional keyboard at all. Instead, you select the letter of your choice from a rotary wheel, and then press the key vertically down into the paper. The reasoning isnt obvious from the outset, but [Toast] explains why this came about after originally hitting a brick wall with a more traditional design.\nIf youve ever wanted to build a typewriter of your own, [Toast]s example shows that you can have a lot of fun just by having a go and seeing where you end up. Weve seen some other neat typewriter hacks over the years, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to David Plass for the tip!]", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u7d19\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u767a\u60f3\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6a5f\u69cb"]}

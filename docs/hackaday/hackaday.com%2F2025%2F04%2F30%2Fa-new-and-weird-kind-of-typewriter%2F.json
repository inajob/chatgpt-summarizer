Thats not to say you cant build one yourself though, as [Toast] did in a very creative fashion.\nAfter being inspired by so many typewriters on YouTube, [Toast] decided they simply had to 3D print one of their own design. They decided to go in a unique direction, eschewing ink ribbons for carbon paper as the source of ink. To create a functional typewriter, they had to develop a typebar mechanism to imprint the paper, as well as a mechanism to move the paper along during typing. The weird thing is the letter selection\u2014the typewriter doesnt have a traditional keyboard at all. Instead, you select the letter of your choice from a rotary wheel, and then press the key vertically down into the paper. The reasoning isnt obvious from the outset, but [Toast] explains why this came about after originally hitting a brick wall with a more traditional design.\nIf youve ever wanted to build a typewriter of your own, [Toast]s example shows that you can have a lot of fun just by having a go and seeing where you end up. Weve seen some other neat typewriter hacks over the years, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to David Plass for the tip!]"}

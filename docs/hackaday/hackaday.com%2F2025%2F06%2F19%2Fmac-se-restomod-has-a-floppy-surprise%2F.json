Excited, because not every day do vintage computers show up at these things. Disgusted, because it had been gutted and coated in house paint; the previous owner apparently wanted to make an aquarium. [Duncan] wanted to make a computer, and after 15 years, he finally did, calling it the PhoeNIX SE.\nNote the small hole in the top floppy bay for the laptop webcam.\nThe NIX part of the name might make you suspect hes running Linux on it, which yes, he absolutely is. The guts of this restomod were donated from a Dell XPS laptop, whose Core i7 CPU and motherboard power the project. A 9.7 LCD serves in place of the original monochrome CRT, held in place by 3D printed hardware. While a purist might complain, its not like anyone makes replacement CRTs anymore, and once thats gone? You might as well go full modern. (The analog board, on the other hand, is available. So is the logic board, if you were wondering. Lacking a CRT, some might have chosen e-ink instead, but the LCD looks good here.)\nAll ports are on the rear, as Steve would have wanted. That original sticker survived under latex paint is a spot of luck.\nHaving gone full modern, well, theres no need for the M5011s dual floppies, so one of them holds a webcam and monitor for a modern experience. A zoom call from that case would be a bit surreal, but we really appreciate the use of the empty floppy bay to keep the clean lines of the Macintosh SE unaltered. The other floppy bay (this is a dual-floppy unit) appears empty; we might have put an SD-card reader or something in there, but we absolutely agree with [Duncan]s choice to 3D Print a new back panel and keep all I/O on the rear of the case, as God and Steve Jobs intended.\nHowever you feel about restomodding retrocomputers (and were aware its a controversial practice), I think we can all agree this is a much better fate for the old Mac than becoming an aquarium. Thanks to [Loddington] for the tip.\nIf youre on the side of the aisle that prefers to see restorations than restomods, the tips line is waiting for some quality restorations.", "title": "- 1987\u5e74\u88fdMacintosh SE\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u300cPhoeNIX SE\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "body": "1987\u5e74\u88fd\u306eMacintosh SE\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306aPC\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- 1987\u5e74\u88fdMacintosh SE\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u300cPhoeNIX SE\u300d\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b", "- \u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305fMac\u304c\u9032\u5316\uff01\u305d\u306e\u5168\u8c8c\u3068\u306f", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u5fa9\u5143\uff1aMacintosh SE\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3078\u3001Mac\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u904b\u547d"]}

In a form factor not unlike a monocular it packed a 640480 digital camera, the images from which could be downloaded to a computer via a serial cable. A quarter century later its a great retro camera for the enthusiast, but both the serial ports and the operating systems needed to run its software have passed into history. Time for the junk pile? Not at all, for [Crazylegstoo] has produced a new piece of software for 2024 that works for both QuickTake 100 and 150 cameras with USB serial ports on modern operating systems.\nCalled JQuickTake, its a Java app which has the advantage of building on that early Java promise of running cross platform so can be had for Mac or Windows. It allows retrieval of both metadata and images from the camera, but sadly it doesnt display any of the images. It also doesnt work with the QuickTake 200. Happily though, there are instructions for building a serial cable, and suggestions for how to deal with the proprietary QTK image format.\nMeanwhile if you lack a PC or Mac all is not lost. You can also use these cameras with an Apple II.\nHeader image: Hannes Grobe, CC BY-SA 4.0.", "title": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u76e4\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u3063\u305fApple QuickTake\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "body": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u534a\u3070\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u3092\u535a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u304c\u3001Apple\u306eQuickTake\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u3057\u305f\u30022024\u5e74\u73fe\u5728\u3001[Crazylegstoo]\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cJQuickTake\u300d\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3057\u3001QuickTake 100\u3068150\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eOS\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u3068\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "titles": ["1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u76e4\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u3063\u305fApple QuickTake\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u7248\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "QuickTake 100\u3068150\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cJQuickTake\u300d", "\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eJava\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\uff1aJQuickTake", "QuickTake\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3068\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u53ef\u80fd\u306aJQuickTake", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306aOS\u3067\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\uff1aQuickTake 100\u3068150\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5411\u3051JQuickTake"]}

Thats a dangerous region, because the component isnt quite hot enough to release the Magic Smoke, but hot enough to singe any finger you poke around with the see if everythings running right. So if youre looking to keep your fingerprints unmodified, but you dont want to invest in a thermal camera, you might want to let this thermochromic breadboard point the way to overloaded components.\nWere not sure where this tip came from, but judging by the look of the website it was sometime in the late 90s. Were also not sure whos behind this little hack, so well just credit [improwis]. The idea is pretty simple  white acrylic paint is mixed with thermochromic pigment, and the mixture is carefully painted onto the plastic surface of a standard-issue solderless breadboard. Care is taken to apply thin coats, lest the paint gets into the contacts and really muck things up. Once the paint is dry youre ready to build your circuit. We have to admit were surprised at how sensitive the paint is; judging by the pictures, the heat coming off a 1/4-watt resistor dissipating 350 mW is plenty, even when the body of the resistor is well above the surface of the breadboard. Wed imagine the paint would point out not only hot components but probably the breadboard contacts too, if things got really toasty.\nThis seems like such a great application of thermochromism, one thats a bit more useful than clocks and Pi Day celebrations. If youre going to try this yourself, youll have to track down your own supply of thermochromic pigment, though  the link in the article is long dead. Thats not a problem, though, as Amazon sells scads of the stuff, seemingly aimed mainly at nail salons. The more you know."}

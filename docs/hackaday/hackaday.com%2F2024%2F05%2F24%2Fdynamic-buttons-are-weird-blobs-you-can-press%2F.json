The Future Interface Group at Carnegie-Mellon has apparently developed just that. Theyre calling the technology DynaButtons, and they look kinda weirdand very awesome.\nThe buttons use electro-osmotic pump technology. Basically, electricity is used to move a fluid under a flexible surface to create a dimple-shaped button. The team was able to increase the flow-rate of these pumps by 300% over traditional designs, while also integrating sensing for interactivity. This allowed the creation of a dynamic button that pops up as needed. The button design is fast and responsive. Its able to readily change its position in an analog manner, both raising up and deflating below the base surface on command.\nWe dont often cover weird goopy-looking projects around here, but maybe we should.\n\n\n[Thanks to Keith Olson for the tip!]"}

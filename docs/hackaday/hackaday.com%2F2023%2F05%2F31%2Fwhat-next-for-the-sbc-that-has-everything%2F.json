Over the years the boards have become faster and more numerous, but the prices for ARM boards are now only nominally as affordable as they were in 2012, and meanwhile the lower end of x86 computing is now firmly in the same space. He demonstrates how much slower the 2023 Raspberry Pi OS distribution is on an original Pi compared to one of the early pre-Raspbian distros, and identifies in that a gap forming between users. From that he sees those people wanting a desktop heading towards the x86 machines, and the bare-metal makers at the lower end heading for the more powerful microcontrollers which simply werent so available a decade ago.\nWe have to admit that we agree with him, as the days when a new Raspberry Pi board was a special step forward rather than just another fast SBC are now probably behind us. In that we think the Pi people are probably also looking beyond their flagship product, as the hugely successful lunches of the RP2040 and the industrial-focused Compute Module 4 have shown.\nWhat do you think about the SBC market? Tell us in the comments.\n\n", "title": "\u300cRaspberry Pi\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6642\u4ee3\u9045\u308c\uff1f\u6b21\u306bSBC\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3078\u5411\u304b\u3046\u306e\u304b\u300d", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u304c\u6700\u521d\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3066\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u5ec9\u4fa1\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff08SBC\uff09\u304c\u7206\u767a\u7684\u306b\u5897\u3048\u305f\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u4e0a\u6607\u3059\u308b\u306b\u3064\u308c\u3066\u3001\u696d\u754c\u306f\u3069\u3053\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u306e\u304b\u3068Christopher Barnatt\u306f\u554f\u3046\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u3001x86\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u5e2f\u304c\u540c\u3058\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u9593\u306b\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u751f\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u5f7c\u306f\u3001x86\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u3068\u300110\u5e74\u524d\u306b\u306f\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3088\u308a\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u4f4e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3068\u6307\u6458\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRaspberry Pi\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6642\u4ee3\u9045\u308c\uff1f\u6b21\u306bSBC\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3078\u5411\u304b\u3046\u306e\u304b\u300d", "\u300cSBC\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u4e0a\u6607\u3068\u9700\u8981\u306e\u62e1\u5927\u306b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300cARM\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u4e0a\u6607\uff1a\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u306e\u5225\u306eSBC\u5e02\u5834\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3059\u308b\uff1f\u300d", "\u300cx86\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u767a\u5c55\u304cSBC\u5e02\u5834\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306eSBC\u5e02\u5834\u306f\u3069\u3046\u306a\u308b\uff1fx86\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u7af6\u4e89\u304c\u6fc0\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff1f\u300d"]}

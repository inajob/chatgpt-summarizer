Out in rural Arkansas, where [vinthewrench] lives, the grid is more chaos than comfort \u2013 especially when storms hit. So, he dug into the problem after watching a cheap AC-DC module quite literally melt down. The full story, as always, begins with the power companys helpful reclosers: lightning-induced surges, and grid switching transients. The result though: toasted boards, shorted transformers, and one very dead Raspberry Pi. [vinthewrench] wrote it all up \u2013 with decent warnings ahead. Take heed and dont venture into things that could put your life in danger.\nBack to the story. Standard surge suppressors? Forget it. Metal-oxide varistor (MOV)-based strips are fine for office laptops, but rural storms laugh at their 600 J limits. While effective and commonly used, MOVs are \u201cself-sacrificing\u201d and degrade over time with each surge event.\n[vinthewrench] wanted something sturdier. Enter ZeusFilter 1.0 \u2013 a line-voltage filter stitched together from real parts: a slow-blow fuse, inrush-limiting thermistor, three-electrode gas discharge tube for lightning-class hits, beefy MOVs for mid-sized spikes, common-mode choke to kill EMI chatter, and safety caps to bleed off whats left. Grounding done right, of course. The whole thing lives on a single-layer PCB, destined to sit upstream of a hardened PSU.\nAs one of his readers pointed out, though, spikes don\u2019t always stop at the input. Sudden cut-offs on the primary can still throw nasty pulses into the secondary, especially with bargain-bin transformers and mystery regulators. The reader reminded that counterfeit 7805s are infamous for failing short, dumping raw input into a supposedly safe 5 V rail. [vinthewrench] acknowledged this too, recalling how collapsing fields don\u2019t just vanish politely \u2013 Lenz makes sure they kick back hard. And yes, when cheap silicon fails, it fails ugly: straight smoke-release mode.\nIn conclusion, were not particularly asking you to try this at home if you lack the proper knowledge. But if you have a high-voltage addiction, this home research is a good start to expand your knowledge of what is, in theory, possible.", "title": "\u96f7\u5bb3\u304b\u3089\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u6e90\u4fdd\u8b77\u56de\u8def\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u96f7\u3084\u96fb\u5727\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001ZeusFilter 1.0\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u306f\u5931\u6557\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u96f7\u5bb3\u304b\u3089\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u6e90\u4fdd\u8b77\u56de\u8def\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30afansa\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\uff1aZeusFilter 1.0\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u5b89\u5168\u7b2c\u4e00\uff01\u96f7\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6307\u5357", "\u5931\u6557\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b5\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fdd\u8b77\u306e\u624b\u6cd5"]}

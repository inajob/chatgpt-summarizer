To that end [Space Lab] is developing the LEAF project that will be part of NASAs upcoming Artemis III lunar mission. This mission would be the first to have Americans return to the Moon by about 2028, using the somewhat convoluted multi-system SLS-Starship-Lunar Gateway trifecta. The LEAF (Lunar Effects on Agricultural Flora) science module will feature three types of plants (rape (Brassica Rapa), duckweed and cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) ) in an isolated atmosphere.\nThe main goal of this project is to find out how the plants are affected by the lunar gravity, radiation and light levels at the landing site at the south pole. This would be the equivalent of a hydroponics setup in a lunar base. After about a week of lunar surface time the growth chamber will be split up into two: one returning back to Earth for examination and the other remains on the surface to observe their long-term health until they perish from cold or other causes.\nThis is not the first time that growing plants on the lunar surface has been attempted, with Chinas Change 4 mission from 2019. The landers Lunar Micro Ecosystem featured a range of seeds as well, which reportedly successfully sprouted, but the project was terminated after 9 days instead of the planned 100 due to issues with heating the biosphere during the brutal -52\u00b0C lunar night. Hopefully LEAF can avoid this kind of scenario when it eventually is deployed on the Moon.", "title": "\u6708\u9762\u3067\u306e\u690d\u7269\u683d\u57f9\u5b9f\u9a13\u300cLEAF\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d\u3068\u306f", "body": "\u6708\u9762\u57fa\u5730\u3067\u306e\u690d\u7269\u683d\u57f9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308bLEAF\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u6708\u9762\u3067\u306e\u690d\u7269\u683d\u57f9\u5b9f\u9a13\u300cLEAF\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d\u3068\u306f", "NASA\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30df\u30b9III\u3067\u306e\u6708\u9762\u8fb2\u696d\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u6708\u306e\u91cd\u529b\u3068\u74b0\u5883\u304c\u690d\u7269\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u6708\u57fa\u5730\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6c34\u8015\u683d\u57f9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u6708\u9762\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068LEAF\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9055\u3044"]}

[Kneesnap] had this problem with a tape containing the only known copy of all the assets for the game Frogger 2: Swampys Revenge, and the tale of how the data was recovered is a dive into both the shady side of the data recovery industry and some clever old-format hacking.\nThe tape was an Onstream cartridge, a short-lived format from a company whose first product hit the market at the end of the 90s and who went bust in 2004. An old drive was found, but it proved to have a pinch roller melted with age, so in desperation the tape was sent to a data recovery company.\nWe admire the forbearance in not naming and shaming the data recovery company, because far from recovering the data they sent it back with the tape damaged and spliced  something you can do with an analogue tape but not a digital one without compromising the data. Then faced with an unrecoverable tape and a slightly different Onstream cartridge, how could anything be salvaged?\nThe answer came in overriding the drives sensors and initializing it with a known-good tape, then swapping out the tapes so that the drive, unaware anything had changed, could read whatever data it could find. In the event the vast majority of the archive was retrieved, making it a win for the preservation of that game.\nThis may be more involved than some recovery stories, but its not the first weve covered."}

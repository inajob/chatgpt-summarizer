The computers theyre attached to are getting up there in age, though, and although these displays are still functional it isnt quite as straightforward to use them outside of their Apple-approved use. [David] demonstrates one way of getting this done by turning a 5k iMac into an external monitor.\nThe first attempt at getting a usable monitor from the old iMac was something called a Luna Display, but this didnt have a satisfying latency. Instead, [David] turned to replacing the LCD driver board with a model called the R1811. This one had a number of problems including uneven backlighting, so he tried a second, less expensive board called the T18. This one only has 8-bit color instead of the 10-bit supported by the R1811 but [David] couldnt personally tell the difference, and since it solved the other issues with the R1811 he went with this one. After mounting the new driver board and routing all of the wires, he also replaced the webcam with an external Logitech model and upgraded the speakers as well.\nEven when counting the costs for both driver boards, the bill for this conversion comes in well under the cost of a new monitor of comparable quality from Apple, a company less concerned about innovation these days than overcharging their (admittedly willing) customers. For just a bit of effort, though, these older iMacs and other similar Apple machines with 5k displays can be repurposed to something relatively modern and still usable. Others have done similar projects and funded the upgrades by selling off the old parts.", "title": "\u53e4\u3044iMac\u3092\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u53e4\u3044iMac\u3092\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u3088\u308a\u4f4e\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u3044iMac\u3092\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "5K\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff01iMac\u306e\u5909\u8eab\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Apple\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\uff1aiMac\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u5316\u3059\u308b", "David\u6c0f\u304c\u6311\u6226\uff01\u65e7iMac\u3092\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u6539\u9020", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u3066\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

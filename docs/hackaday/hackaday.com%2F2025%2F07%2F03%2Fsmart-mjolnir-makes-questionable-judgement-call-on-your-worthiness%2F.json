[alemanjir] decided to build a semi-functional replica that makes judgement calls of its own, though theyre perhaps a little less thought-out than the storied hammer of legend.\nThe build consists of a 3D-printed hammer prop, inside of which is a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller running the show. Its hooked up to a MPR121 touch sensor that detects when someone grips the handle of the hammer. At this point, the Pico makes a pseudorandom worthiness check as to whether the holder is righteous enough to wield the hammer. If they are pure of heart, it unlocks a magnet which frees the hammer from whatever metallic surface it might be stuck to. [alemanjir] also included a little additional functionality, with the hammer playing various sounds when swung thanks to a speaker and a ADXL345 accelerometer secreted inside.\nOne wonders whether the electromagnet inside is strong enough to hold out against an unworthy person lifting it from the ground. While its perhaps not as powerful or as decisive as the mythical object, its nonetheless a fun learning project that likely taught [alemanja] some useful basics of embedded development.\nWeve featured some terrifying takes of the Mjolnir prop before, too, like this shockingly high voltage version. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30bd\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u8fd1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3001Mjolnir\u306e\u6a21\u9020\u54c1\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u6301\u3061\u4e3b\u306e\u300c\u4fa1\u5024\u300d\u3092\u5224\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u3082\u51fa\u308b\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30bd\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u4f5c\u308bMjolnir\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab", "- \u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\u5224\u5b9a\uff01\u6301\u3064\u8005\u306e\u300c\u771f\u4fa1\u300d\u3092\u8a66\u3059\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc", "- \u97f3\u3068\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8Mjolnir\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u308bMjolnir\u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9"]}

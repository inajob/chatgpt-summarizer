Even in the 1990s, you were looking at spending a a Benjamin or two to get computer squawking down the phone lines. According to [Cameron Kaiser], though, its possible to whip up a softmodem using a Commodore 64 for much cheaper than that. How much? Just 35 cents, were told!\nThe inspiration was simple\u2014Rockwell apparently used to build modems using the 6502. The Commodore 64 has a 6502 inside, pretty much, so surely it could be a softmodem, right? Indeed, one [John Iannetta] had done this in a one-way form in the 1980s, using the Commodore 64s SID audio chip to output data in sound form. In 1998, he espoused the 35-cent modem\u2014basically, the price of buying an RCA jack to hook up a phone line to your Commodore 64.\nAs [Cameron] found out, the concept still works today, as does [Johns] code, but its more like 68 cents in 2025 dollars. With the right bits and pieces, and a little code, you can have your C64 modulating data into sound at rates of 300 baud.\nIts hacky, slow, and theres no real way to receive\u2014the C64 just doesnt have the chops to demodulate these kinds of signals on its own. You also shouldnt use it on a real phone line if you dont want to damage your C64. Still, its a wonderful bit of hackery, and its fun to see how well it works. Weve seen some other great Commodore 64 modem projects before, like the ever-useful RetroModem.

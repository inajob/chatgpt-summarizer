[Pelham Bergesen] took the class and built himself a MIDI-controllable synthesizer out of a Raspberry Pi Pico.\n[Pelham] coded a library to parse MIDI messages on the Pico, with the microcontrollers UART charged with receiving the input data. MIDI is basically just serial at a baud rate of 31.25k, with a set message structure, after all. From there, the Pico takes the note data and plays the relevant frequencies by synthesizing square waves using a PWM output. A second PWM channel can also be blended with the first to generate more complex tones.\u00a0 The synthesizer is designed to be used with a source of MIDI note data such as a keyboard controller; [Pelham] demonstrates the project in use with a Roland JD-XI. Its a fairly basic synthesizer, but [Pelham] does a good job of explaining all the steps required to get this far. If youve never done an audio or MIDI project before, you might find his guide very helpful for the way it steps through the basics.\n[Pelham] didnt get to implement fancier features like direct digital synthesis (DDS) or analog audio effects before the class closed out. However, that would be an excellent project for anyone else developing their own Pico synthesizer. If you whip up something that sounds good, or even just interesting,\u00a0be sure to notify us on the tipsline. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "body": "Cornell\u5927\u5b66\u306eECE 4760\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u591a\u5c90\u306b\u308f\u305f\u308b\u3002\u305d\u306e\u4e2d\u3067[Pelham Bergesen]\u306f\u3001Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066MIDI\u5236\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u4e01\u5be7\u306b\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u307e\u305f\u306fMIDI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u30d4\u30b3\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067MIDI\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u5408\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u300d", "\u300c\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u306b\u3088\u308aPWM\u51fa\u529b\u3067\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u97f3\u8272\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u97f3\u697d\u3084MIDI\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u300d"]}

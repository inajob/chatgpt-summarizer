If you want to build your own wireless motorized fader controls for your own projects, you might like this project from [Ian Peterson].\nFaders are useful controls, but theyre usually very one-way devices\u2014you set them to what you want, and thats it. However, motorized faders are a little fancier. You can move them yourself, or they can be moved under the command of other hardware or software\u2014making a control change automatically that is still visible to the human in front of the control panel.\n[Ian Peterson] built his OSCillator motorized fader for his work with lighting consoles in theater contexts. Its name references the Open Sound Control (OSC) platform which is commonly used across various lighting consoles. His build relies on an ESP32 to run the show, which communicates with other lighting hardware via WiFi. The microcontroller is responsible for reading the position of the fader and built-in button, and sending the relevant commands to other lighting devices on the network. At the same time, it must also listen to commands from lighting consoles on the network and update the motorized faders position in turn if the relevant control its mapped to has been changed elsewhere.\nIf youre working in theater or film and youre wanting to control lighting cues wirelessly, a tool like this can really come in handy. We dont see a lot of motorized faders in DIY projects, but they pop up now and then.\n\n"}

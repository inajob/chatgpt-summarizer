We didnt say he wanted to learn a new skill that might land him a job. But we get it and even applaud it. Especially since hes written a multi-part post about what hes doing and how you can do it, too. So far, there are four parts, and wed bet there are more to come.\nThe series starts with the obligatory hello world, as well as some basic setup steps. By part 2, you are learning about registers and numbers. Part 3 covers some instructions, and by part 4, he finds that there are even more registers to contend with.\n\nOne of the great things about doing a project like this today is that you dont have to have real hardware. Even if you want to eventually run on real hardware, you can edit in comfort, compile on a fast machine, and then debug and test on an emulator. [Michal] uses VICE.\nThe series is far from complete, and we hear part 5 will talk about branching, so this is a good time to catch up.\nWe love applying modern tools to old software development.", "title": "- Commodore 64\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u78e8\u304f", "body": "Michal Sapka\u306f\u3001Commodore 64\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u958b\u59cb\u3002\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u3001\u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u5fdc\u7528\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- Commodore 64\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u78e8\u304f", "- \u5b9f\u6a5f\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u57fa\u790e\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\uff01C64\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "- Michal Sapka\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u8b1b\u5ea7\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba", "- \u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u6614\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067"]}

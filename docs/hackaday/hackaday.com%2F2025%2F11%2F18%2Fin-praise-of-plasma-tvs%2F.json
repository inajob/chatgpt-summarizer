It\u2019s not a productivity machine, by any means, but the screen has the resolution to do it so I started this document to prove a point. That point? Plasma TVs are awesome.\nAlways the Bridesmaid, Never the Bride\nAn Egyptian god might see pixels on an 8K panel, but we puny mortals wont. Image Horus Eye 2 by [Jeff Dahl]The full-colour plasma screens that were used as TVs in the 2000s are an awkward technological cul-de-sac. Everyone knows and loves CRTs for the obvious benefits they offer\u2013 bright colours, low latency, and scanlines to properly blur pixel art. Modern OLEDs have more resolution than the Eye of Horus, never mind your puny human orbs, and barely sip power compared to their forbearers. Plasma, though? Not old enough to be retro-cool, not new enough to be high-tech, plasma displays are sadly forgotten.\nIt\u2019s funny, because I firmly believe that without plasma displays, CRTs would have never gone away. Perhaps for that I should hate them, but it\u2019s for the very reasons that Plasma won out over HD-CRTs in the market place that I love them.\nWhat You Get When You Get a Plasma TV\nI didn\u2019t used to love Plasma TVs. Until a few years ago, I thought of them like you probably do: clunky, heavy, power-hungry, first-gen flatscreens that were properly consigned to the dustbin of history. Then I bought a house.\nThe house came with a free TV\u2013 a big plasma display in the basement. It was left there for two reasons: it was worthless on the open market and it weighed a tonne. I could take it off the wall by myself, but I could feel the ghost of OSHA past frowning at me when I did. Hauling it up the stairs? Yeah, I\u2019d need a buddy for that\u2026 and it was 2020. By the time I was organizing the basement, we\u2019d just gone into lockdown, and buddies were hard to come by. So I put it back on the wall, plugged in my laptop, and turned it on.\nI was gobsmacked. It looked exactly like a CRT\u2013 a giant, totally flat CRT in glorious 1080p. When I stepped to the side, it struck me again: like a CRT, the viewing angle is \u201cyes\u201d.\nHow it Works\nNone of this should have come as a surprise, because I know how a Plasma TV works. I\u2019d just forgotten how good they are. See, a Plasma TV really was an attempt to get all that CRT goodness in a flat screen, and the engineers at Fujitsu, and later elsewhere, really pulled it off.\nLike CRTs, you\u2019ve got phosphors excited to produce points of light to create an image\u2013 and only when excited, so the blacks are as black as they get. The phosphors are chemically different from those in CRTs but they come in similar colours, so colours on old games and cartoons look right in a way they don\u2019t even on my MacBook\u2019s retina display.\nUnlike a CRT, there\u2019s no electron beam scanning the screen, and no shadow mask. Instead, the screen is subdivided into individual pixels inside the flat vacuum panel. The pixels are individually addressed and zapped on and off by an electric current. Unlike a CRT or SED, the voltage here isn\u2019t high enough to generate an electron beam to excite the phosphors; instead the gas discharge inside the display emits enough UV light to do the same job.\nEach phosphor-filled pixel glows with its own glorious light thanks to the UV from gas discharge in the cell.Image based on Plasma-Display-Composition.svg by [Jari Laamanen].Still, if it feels like a CRT, and thats because the subpixels are individual blobs of phosphors, excited from behind, and generating their own glorious light.\nIt\u2019s Not the Same, Though\nIt\u2019s not a CRT, of course. The biggest difference is that its a fixed-pixel display, with all that comes with that. This particular TV has all the ports on the back to make it great for retrogaming, but the NES, or what have you, signal still has to be digitally upscaled to match the resolution. Pixel art goes unblurred by scanlines unless I add it in via emulation, so despite the colour and contrast, it\u2019s not quite the authentic experience.\nFor some things, like the Atari 2600, the scanline blur really doesnt matter. Image: Atari 2600 on my 42 inch plasma TV by [Jeffisageek]\u00a0The built-in upscaling doesn\u2019t introduce enough latency for a filthy casual like me to notice, but I\u2019ll never be able to play Duck Hunt on the big screen unless I fake it with a Wii. Apparently some Plasma TVs are awesome for latency on the analog inputs, and others are not much better than an equivalent-era LCD. There\u2019s a reason serious retro gamers pay serious money for big CRTs.\nThose big CRTs don\u2019t have to worry about burn in, either, something I have been very careful in the five years I\u2019ve owned this second-hand plasma display to avoid. I can\u2019t remember thinking much about burn-in with CRTs since we retired the amber-phosphor monitor plugged into the Hercules Graphics card on our family\u2019s 286 PC.\nThe dreaded specter of burn-in is plasma\u2019s Achilles heel \u2013 more than the weight and thickness, which were getting much better before LG pulled the plug as the last company to exit this space, or the Energy Star ratings, which weren\u2019t going to catch up to LED-backlit LCDs, but had improved as well. The fear of burn-in made you skip the plasma, especially for console gaming.\nThis screen is haunted by the ghost of CNNs old logo. Burning in game graphics was less common but more fun. Ironically, its an LCD. Image: logo of CNN burnt on a screen by [Nate]Early plasma displays could permanently damage the delicate phosphors in only a handful of hours. That damage burnt the unmoving parts of an image permanently into the phosphors in the form of \u201cghosting\u201d, and unless you caught it early, it was generally not repairable. The ghosting issue got better over time, but the technology never escaped the stigma, and the problem never entirely went away. If that meant that after a marathon Call-of-Duty session the rest of the family had to stare at your HUD on every movie night, Dad wasn\u2019t going to buy another plasma display.\nBy the end, the phosphors improved and various tricks like jiggling the image pixel-by-pixel were found to avoid burn-in, and it seems to have worked: there\u2019s absolutely no ghosting on my model, and you can sometimes find late-model Plasma TVs for the low, low cost of \u201cget this thing off my wall and up the stairs\u201d that are equally un-haunted. I may grab another, even if I have to pay for it. It\u2019s a lot easier to hide a spare flatscreen than an extra CRT, another advantage to the plasma TVs, and in no case do phosphors last forever.\nBut Wheres the Hack?\nIs grab an old flat screen instead of hunting around for an impossible CRT a hack? Maybe it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s worth considering, though, because Plasma TVs don\u2019t get the love they deserve. (And seriously, you\u2019re not going to find the mythical 43-inch CRT, even if it technically existed. And youll never find a tube that could match the 152\u201d monster Panasonic put out to claim the record back in the day.)\nIn the mean time, I\u2019m going to enjoy the contrast ratio, refresh rate, and the bonus space heater. I\u2019m in Canada, and winter is coming, so its hard to get too overworked about waste heat when theres frost on your windowpanes.\nFeatured image: IFA 2010 Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin 124 by [Bin im Garten]."}

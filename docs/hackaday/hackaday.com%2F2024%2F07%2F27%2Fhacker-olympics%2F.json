It\u2019s an over-the-top presentation meant to draw people into sport. And for the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be seeing people from all across the world competing in their chosen physical activities. There will be triumph and defeat, front-runners who nonetheless lag behind on that day, and underdogs who sneak ahead. In short, a lot of ado about sport, and I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing. Sports are fun.\nBut where is the Hacker Olympics? Or even more broadly the Science Olympics or Engineering Olympics? Why don\u2019t we celebrate the achievements of great thinkers, planners, and builders the same way that we celebrate fast runners or steady shooters? With all the pomp and showmanship and so on?\nHere at Hackaday, we try our best! When we see a cool hack, we celebrate it. But we\u2019re one little blog, with about a millionth the budget of the International Olympic Commission. However, we have you all as our biggest multiplier. It would be awesome if we could take over the entire city of Paris in celebration of science and engineering, but until then, if you see something smart, share it with us. And if you see something on Hackaday that you think was awesome, share it with your friends.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks. It also includes our favorite articles from the last seven days that you can see on the web version of the newsletter.\n\nWant this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning?

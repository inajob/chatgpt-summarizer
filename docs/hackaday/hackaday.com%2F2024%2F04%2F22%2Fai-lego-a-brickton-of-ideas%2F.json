Its a childhood dream come true, right? Well, that device is in your pocket. Just dump out your LEGO stash on the carpet, spread it out so theres only one layer, scan it with your phone, and after a short wait, you get a list of all the the fun things you can make. With building instructions. And oh yeah, it shows you where each brick is in the pile.\nWe are talking about the BrickIt app, which is available for Android and Apple. Check it out in the short demo after the break. Having personally tried the app, we can say it does what it says it does and is in fact quite cool.\nAs much as it may pain you to have to pick up all those bricks when youre finished, it really does work better against a neutral background like light-colored carpet. In an attempt to keep the bricks corralled, we tried a wooden tray, and it didnt seem to be working as well as it probably could have  it didnt hold that many bricks, and they couldnt be spread out that far.\nAnd the only real downside is that results are limited because theres a paid version. And the app is kind of constantly reminding you of what youre missing out on. But its still really, really cool, so check it out.\nWe dont have to tell you how versatile LEGO is. But have you seen this keyboard stand, or this PCB vise?\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip!", "title": "\u300c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea BrickIt\u300d", "body": "LEGO\u3092\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4f5c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u624b\u9806\u304c\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306b\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308bBrickIt\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002Android\u3068Apple\u3067\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u3002\u5149\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30ab\u30fc\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3002\u5e83\u544a\u3068\u5236\u9650\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea BrickIt\u300d", "\u300cLEGO\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u767a\u898b\u300d", "\u300cLEGO\u3092\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u300d", "\u300cLEGO\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u624b\u6301\u3061\u306eLEGO\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u300d"]}

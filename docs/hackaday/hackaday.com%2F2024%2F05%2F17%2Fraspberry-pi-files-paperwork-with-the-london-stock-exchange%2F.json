Labelled Investor relations, it holds links to the documents filed with the London Stock Exchange of their intention to float. In other words, its confirmation of their upcoming share offering.\nIt has been interesting to watch the growth of Raspberry Pi over the last twelve years, from cottage industry producing a thousand boards in China, to dominating the SBC market and launching their own successful silicon. Without either a crystal ball or a window into Eben Uptons mind, were as unreliable as anyone else when it comes to divining their future path. But since were guessing that it will involve ever more complex silicon with a raspberry logo, its obvious that the float will give them the investment springboard they need.\nFor those of us who have been around for a long time this isnt the first company in our corner of the technology world weve seen burn brightly. Its not even the first from Cambridge. Appointing ourselves as pundits though, wed say that Raspberry Pis path to this point has been surprisingly understated, based upon the strength of its products rather than hype, and while Eben is undoubtedly a well-known figure, not based upon a cult of personality. There is already a significant ecosystem around Raspberry Pi, wed like to think that this move will only strengthen it. We may not be looking at the British Microsoft, but we dont think were looking at another Sinclair either.", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u682a\u5f0f\u516c\u958b\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u304c\u682a\u5f0f\u516c\u958b\u3092\u610f\u56f3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002Raspberry Pi\u306f\u904e\u53bb12\u5e74\u3067\u6025\u6210\u9577\u3057\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u5c55\u958b\u3059\u308b\u898b\u8fbc\u307f\u3002\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u5f37\u307f\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u305f\u5730\u9053\u306a\u6210\u9577\u3068\u3001Eben\u306e\u4eba\u683c\u5d07\u62dd\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u88fd\u54c1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u304c\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u682a\u5f0f\u516c\u958b\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u6210\u9577\u3092\u8ffd\u3046", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u671f\u5f85", "\u6295\u8cc7\u5bb6\u306b\u958b\u304b\u308c\u305f\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u306e\u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u3092\u5f37\u5316"]}

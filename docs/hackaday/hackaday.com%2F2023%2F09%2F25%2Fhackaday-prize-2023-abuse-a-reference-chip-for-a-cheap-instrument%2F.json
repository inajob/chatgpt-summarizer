Theyre by no means cheap though, so over time weve seen some interesting variations on making one without the pain in the wallet. We particularly like [Stephen]s one, because he eschews exotic devices for an interesting hack on a familiar chip. Hes taken the venerable TL431 voltage reference chip and turned it into an op-amp.\nWe had to look at the TL431 data sheet for this one and shamefacedly admit that since wed only ever used the chip as a voltage reference, we hadnt appreciated this capability. In this mode, its a op-amp with the inverting input connected to a fixed rail, so it can accept a feedback network to its non-inverting input just like any other. Hes using it as both integrator and amplifier, as well as, of course, in a more conventional power supply.\nWe like the instrument, and the use of the TL431 in an unexpected manner is the cherry on the cake. Heres a previous Rogowski circuit using more conventional parts. You can dive a bit more into the theory, too.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

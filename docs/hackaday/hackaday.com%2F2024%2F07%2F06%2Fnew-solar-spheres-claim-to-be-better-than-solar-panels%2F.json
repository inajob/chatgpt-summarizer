A company called WAVJA wants you to think of spheres. The little spheres, ranging from one to four inches across, can convert light into electricity, and the company claims they have 7.5 times the output of traditional solar panels and could later produce even more. Unfortunately, the video below doesnt have a great deal of detail to back up the claims.\nSome scenes in the video are clearly forward-looking. However, the so-called photon energy system appears to be powering a variety of real devices. Its difficult to assess some of the claims. For example, the video claims 60 times the output of a similar-sized panel. But youd hardly expect much from a tiny 4-inch solar panel.\n\nWhat do you think? Do they really have layers of exotic material? If we were going to bet, wed bet these claims are a bit of hyperbole. Then again, who knows? Well be watching to see what technical details emerge. We have to admit that quotes like this from their website dont make us especially hopeful:\nrelies on the use of multiple layers of materials and special spheres to introduce sunlight and generate a significant amount of luminosity, which is then transformed into electricity using a silicon conductor module\nThere are ways to make solar technology more efficient. But we do see a lot of solar energy claims that are  well  inflated.\n"}

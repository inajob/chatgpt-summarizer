Inside was a mere 68000, but it ran Mac OS system 6 and looked light years ahead of any comparable PC in doing so.\nBack in 1989 it wasnt even the norm for a computer to have built-in Ethernet, and WiFi was still a gleam in the eye of some Dutch engineers, so how has [Joshua Stein] managed to get his Mac Portable on a wireless network here in 2023? The answer contains a few surprises.\nWhen seeing a WiFi upgrade for a classic retrocomputer the usual expectation is that its done by emulating a modem connection to the Internet over a serial port. But this wireless network card is a bit different, its a real network card capable of being used for much more than just connecting to the Internet.\nWe have to admit to not knowing that there were SCSI Ethernet interfaces back in the day, and its one of these that hes created. Hes building on a decades work in producing disk emulators for the SCSI bus, and hes taken the code for a Raspberry Pi Pico version and adapted the SCSI driver part to interface with the onboard WiFi on a Pico W. Altogether its a beautiful piece of work, and you can color us impressed."}

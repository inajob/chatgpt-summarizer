But that simplicity at heart leaves endless scope for further work, and a home-made camera can be every bit as much a highly-engineered object of beauty as its commercial stablemate. A great example comes from [Aaron Cr\u00e9], whose desire for something close to a Hasselblad XPan panoramic camera led him to build his own equivalent out of wood.\nThe video below the break shows in detail how the wooden case is crafted, and how a lens mount ring sawn from a lens adapter is mounted on the front of it. Hes skipped making all the tiresome parts of the camera associated with winding and film transport and instead taken them from a cheap plastic snapshot camera. The original aspect ratio is stretched by cutting the guts of the snapshot camera apart, and extended to make a 75 mm long negative which also exposes over the sprocket holes.\nThe final camera is carefully finished to the point at which it really looks the part as well as taking those striking wide-angle photographs. Were not photography buffs enough to identify the lens and shutter combination hes using, but we cant help envying him the results. Fancy making your own 35 mm camera too? Heres another, in case you need inspiration.\n\n", "title": "DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u6728\u88fd\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9XPan\u306b\u5339\u6575\u3059\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u306b", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9XPan\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3002\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5e83\u89d2\u5199\u771f\u304c\u64ae\u308c\u308b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u6728\u88fd\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9XPan\u306b\u5339\u6575\u3059\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u306b", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3001\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u6728\u88fd\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9XPan\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u6728\u88fd\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304b\u3089\u6d41\u7528\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806\u3092\u516c\u958b", "\u30d1\u30ce\u30e9\u30de\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c35mm\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

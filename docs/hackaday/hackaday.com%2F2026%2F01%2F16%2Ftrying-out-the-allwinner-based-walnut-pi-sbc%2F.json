At least not if they want to stay safe from Broadcoms vicious legal team. That said, the Walnut Pi 1B single-board computer (SBC) that [Silly Workshop] recently took a gander at seems to be taking a fairly typical approach to a Raspberry Pi 4 form factor compatible board.\nPart of Walnut Pis line-up, the Allwinner H616/H168-equipped 1B feels like it takes hints from both the RPi 4B and the Asus Tinkerboard, especially with its nicely colored GPIO pins. Theres also a beefier Walnut Pi 2B with an Allwinner T527 SoC thats not being reviewed here. Translating the Chinese-language documentation for the board suggests that either the H616 or H618 may be installed, with both featuring a quad-core Cortex-A53, so in the ballpark of the Raspberry Pi 3.\nThere are also multiple RAM configurations, ranging from 1 GB of DDR3 to 4 GB of LPDDR4, with the 1 GB version being fun to try and run benchmarks like GeekBench on. Ultimately the impression was that its just another Allwinner SoC-based board, with a half-hearted custom Linux image, no hardware acceleration due to missing (proprietary) Allwinner IP block drivers, etc.\nWhile cheaper than a Raspberry Pi SBC, if you need anything more than the basic Allwinner H61* support and Ethernet/WiFi, there clearly are better options, some of which may even involve repurposing an e-waste Android TV box.\n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\uff1aWalnut Pi 1B\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6027\u80fd", "body": "Walnut Pi 1B\u306fRaspberry Pi\u3068\u4f3c\u305f\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3001Allwinner SoC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u306f\u9650\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u306f\u7269\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u3055\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\uff1aWalnut Pi 1B\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u6027\u80fd", "- Allwinner SoC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fWalnut Pi 1B\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "- Raspberry Pi 4\u4e92\u63db\u306eWalnut Pi 1B\u3092\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b\uff1aWalnut Pi\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5411\u3051Walnut Pi 1B\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u9650\u754c"]}

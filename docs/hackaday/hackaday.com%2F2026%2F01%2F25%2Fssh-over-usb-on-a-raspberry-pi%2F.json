The most common method is to configure Wi-Fi access and an SSH service on the Pi before starting it, which can go wrong in many different ways. This author, for example, recently spent a few hours failing to set up a headless Pi on a network secured with Protected EAP, and was eventually driven to using SSH over Bluetooth. This could thankfully soon be a thing of the past, as [Paul Oberosler] developed a package for SSH over USB, which is included in the latest versions of Raspberry Pi OS.\nThe idea behind rpi-usb-gadget is that a Raspberry Pi in gadget mode can be plugged into a host machine, which recognizes it as a network adapter. The Pi itself is presented as a host on that network, and the host machine can then SSH into it. Additionally, using Internet Connection Sharing (ICS), the Pi can use the host machine\u2019s internet access. Gadget mode can be enabled and configured from the Raspberry Pi Imager. Setting up ICS is less plug-and-play, since an extra driver needs to be installed on Windows machines. Enabling gadget mode only lets the selected USB port work as a power input and USB network port, not as a host port for other peripherals.\nAn older way to get USB terminal access is using OTG mode, which we\u2019ve seen used to simplify the configuration of a Pi as a simultaneous AP and client. If you want to set up headless access to Raspberry Pi desktop, we have a guide for that.\nThanks to [Gregg Levine] for the tip!", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3067\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9Raspberry Pi\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3001USB\u7d4c\u7531\u306eSSH\u63a5\u7d9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3067\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- USB\u7d4c\u7531\u306eSSH\u3067Raspberry Pi\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Raspberry Pi\u306e\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316", "- Protected EAP\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u5411\u3051\u306eRaspberry Pi\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "- \u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306eRaspberry Pi\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u3068\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

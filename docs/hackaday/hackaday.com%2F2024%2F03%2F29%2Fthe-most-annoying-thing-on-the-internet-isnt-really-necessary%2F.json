Which of them we rate as most annoying depends on personal view, but were guessing that quite a few of you will join us in naming the ubiquitous cookie pop-up at the top of the list. Its the pesky EU demanding consent for tracking cookies, were told, nothing to do with whoever is demanding you click through screens and screens of slider switches to turn everything off before you can view their website.\nNow [Bite Code] is here to remind us that its not necessary. Not in America for the somewhat obvious reason that its not part of the EU, and perhaps surprisingly, not even in the EU itself.\nThe EU does have a consent requirement, but the point made in the article is that its requirements are satisfied by the Do Not Track header standard, an HTTP feature thats been with us since 2009 but which almost nobody implemented so is now deprecated. This allowed a user to reject tracking at the browser level, making all the cookie popups irrelevant. That popups were chosen instead, the article concludes, is due to large websites preferring to make the process annoying enough that users simply click on the consent button to make it go away, making tracking much more likely. We suspect that the plethora of cookie popups also has something to do with FUD among owners of smaller websites, that somehow they dont comply with the law if they dont have one.\nSo as wed probably all agree, the tracking cookie situation is a mess. This post is being written of Firefox which now silos cookies to only the site which delivered them, but there seems to be little for the average user stuck with either of the big browsers. Perhaps we should all hope for a bit more competition in the future.\nCookies header: Lisa Fotios, CC0.", "title": "Web\u306e\u8ff7\u60d1\u306a\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u6b27\u5dde\u9023\u5408\uff08EU\uff09\u304c\u8ffd\u8de1\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u306b\u540c\u610f\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u4e0a\u3067\u6700\u3082\u8ff7\u60d1\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001EU\u3067\u3055\u3048\u3082\u8ffd\u8de1\u3092\u62d2\u5426\u3067\u304d\u308bDo Not Track\u30d8\u30c3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5927\u624b\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306f\u5229\u4fbf\u6027\u3092\u512a\u5148\u3057\u3066\u8ff7\u60d1\u306a\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u78ba\u306a\u6cd5\u4ee4\u3078\u306e\u6050\u308c\u3082\u95a2\u4fc2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["Web\u306e\u8ff7\u60d1\u306a\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "UE\u306eCookie\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u8ffd\u8de1\u3092\u62d2\u5426\u3067\u304d\u308bDo Not Track\u30d8\u30c3\u30c0\u30fc\u3068\u306f", "\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u8ffd\u8de1\u9632\u6b62\u624b\u6cd5", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u6226\u4e89\u3068\u8ffd\u8de1\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u554f\u984c"]}

What other tools do you use in your work or your extra-curricular projects, and how long have you been using them? Are you still designing your analog front-ends with LM358s, or have you looked around to see that technology has moved on since the 1970s? \u201cOMG, you\u2019re still using ST32F103s?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a simple question, and there are no good answers. Proficiency with a tool, like for instance the audio editor with which I crank out the podcast every week, only comes through practice. And practice simply takes time and effort. When you put your time in on a tool, it really is an investment in that it helps you get better. But what about that newer, better tool out there?\nSome of the reluctance to update is certainly sunk-cost fallacy, after all you put so much sweat and tears into the current tool, but there is also a real cost to overcome to learn the new hotness, and that\u2019s no fallacy. If you\u2019re always trying to learn a new way of doing something, you\u2019re never going to get good at doing something, and that\u2019s the lament of our artist friend. Honing your craft requires focus. You won\u2019t know the odd feature set of that next microcontroller as well as you do the old faithful \u2013 without sitting down and reading the datasheet and doing a couple finger-stretching projects first.\nStriking the optimal balance here is hard. On a per-project basis, staying with your good old tool or swapping to the new hotness is a binary choice, but across your projects, you can do some of each. Maybe it makes sense to budget some of your hacking time into learning new tools? How about ten percent? What do you think?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Same goes for things like pollution and carbon footprint. A vehicle, for example, might have a low carbon footprint in operation but require more carbon in the manufacturing or disposal processes. Researchers have noted that FPGA accelerators get replaced and may wind up as e-waste in as little as two years. They propose REFRESH, an architecture that recycles old FPGAs into new ones by joining multiple FPGA dice with a simple interposer to coordinate the work.\nThe idea is not as radical as it might first seem. Many modern chips use chiplets anyway, so this is a reasonable extension of that idea. You simply need a way to harvest the old devices.\n\nOf course, design tools for these hybrid recycled FPGAs would require work, too. We imagine that if you are not worried about the carbon footprint, you probably wont be keen to develop a process for recycling chips, making new ones from them, and standing up a different toolchain. But there are a few factors that could make it worthwhile  tax incentives, for example.\nWe are more likely to recycle plastic bottles. Or even metal beverage cans."}

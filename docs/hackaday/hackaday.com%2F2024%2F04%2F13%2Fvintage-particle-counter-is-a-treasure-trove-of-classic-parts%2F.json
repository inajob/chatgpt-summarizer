Rather, this was more likely an instrument installed in cleanrooms to make sure the particulate counts didnt come out of range. As such, it was built like a battleship in a huge case stuffed with card after card of electronics, along with the attendant pumps and filters needed to draw in samples. But still, the fact that we can put essentially the same functionality into a device that easily fits in the palm of your hand is pretty striking.\n[Les] clearly bought this instrument to harvest parts from it, and theres a ton of other goodness inside, including multiple copies of pretty much every chip from the Z80 family. The analog section has some beautiful Teledyne TP1321 op-amps in TO-99 cans. Everything is in immaculate condition, and obsolete or not, this is an enviable haul of vintage parts, especially the helium-neon laser at its heart, which still works. [Les] promises an in-depth look at that in a follow-up video, but for now, he treats us to a little tour of the optics used to measure particulates by the amount of laser light thats scattered.\nAll things considered, [Les] really made out well on this find  much better than his last purchase.\n\n", "title": "1987\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u4f53", "body": "1987\u5e74\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u4f53\u3092\u901a\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3092\u5b9f\u611f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u304b\u3089\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3002Z80\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3084Teledyne TP1321\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306a\u3069\u3082\u3002\u8981\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u304c\u53ce\u7a6b\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1987\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u89e3\u4f53", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u6e80\u8f09\uff011987\u5e74\u7248\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u89e3\u8aac", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f40\u5e74\u306e\u6280\u8853\u9032\u6b69", "\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u7c92\u5b50\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u89e3\u8aac"]}

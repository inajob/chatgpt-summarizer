And although its getting harder and harder to find slot machines with actual pull-able handles instead of just big buttons, you can easily simulate the handle at home with the right kind of limit switch, as [Andrew Smith] did with their micro slot machine.\nThis baby slot machine is built around the Adafruit 55 NeoPixel grid, which is an add-on for the QT Py. As youll see in the brief demo video after the break, the switch actuates on release, which starts the lights a-spinning. [Andrew] says the constraints of the SAMD21-powered QT Py made this a particularly fun challenge.\nWhereas most physical slot machines have different reel sequences, this build uses just one. [Andrew] declared hex values to ID each color, and then created the reel manually with different color frequencies. When the lever is released, the columns are animated and slowly to come to rest at a random offset. You can check out the code on GitHub.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30df\u30cb\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002QT Py\u3068Adafruit NeoPixel\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u6642\u306b\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u304c\u56de\u8ee2\u30021\u3064\u306e\u30ea\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u307f\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u6307\u5b9a\u3002GitHub\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "Adafruit 55 NeoPixel\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "QT Py\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3", "\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "GitHub\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u516c\u958b - \u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3DIY"]}

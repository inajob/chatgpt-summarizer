The answer probably depends more on the tape than the user, but it does show how sturdy the coiled spring steel rulers can be. [Gengzhi He et. al.] may have been playing that game in the lab at UC San Diego when they hit upon the idea for a new kind of low-cost robotic gripper.\nFour motors, four strips of measuring tape (doubled up) one robot hand.\nWith the lovely backronym GRIP-tape  standing for Grasping and Rolling in Plane  you get a sense for what this effector can do. Its two fingers are each made of loops of doubled-up measuring tape bound together with what looks suspiciously like duck tape. With four motors total, the fingers can be lengthened or shortened by spooling the tape, allowing\u00a0 a reaching motion, pivot closer or further apart for grasping, and move-in-place like conveyor belts, rotating the object in their grasp.\nThe combination means it can reach out, grab a light bulb, and screw it into a socket. Or open and decant a jar of spices. Another video shows the gripper reaching out to pick a lemon, and gently twist it off the tree. Its quite a performance for a device with such modest components.\nAt the moment, the gripper is controlled via remote; the researchers plan on adding sensors and AI autonomous control. Read all the details in the preprint, or check below the fold to watch the robot in action.\nThis is hardly the first time weve highlighted a grabby robot. Weve seen belts, weve seen origami  but this is the first time weve seen a measuring tape. Have you seen a cool robot? Toss us a tip. Wed love to hear from you.\n\n\nTip of the hat to reader [anonymouse] for pointing this one out.", "title": "- \u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "UC\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30b4\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u958b\u767a\u30024\u3064\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u7269\u3092\u3064\u304b\u3080\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- GRIP-tape: \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc4\u3064\u3067\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u305f\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u88fd\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u672a\u6765", "- \u8efd\u91cf\u7269\u3092\u63b4\u3080\uff01\u6e2c\u5b9a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u306f"]}

That\u2019s the idea behind ice batteries, a clever energy storage hack that\u2019s been quietly slashing cooling costs across commercial buildings. The invention works by freezing water when energy is cheap, and using that stored cold later, they turn major power hogs (air conditioning, were looking at you) into more efficient, cost-effective systems.\nPioneers like Nostromo Energy and Ice Energy are refining the tech. Nostromos IceBrick modules pack 25 kWh of cooling capacity each, install on rooftops, and cost around $250 per kWh\u2014about half the price of lithium-ion storage. Ice Energys Ice Bear 40 integrates with HVAC systems, shifting up to 95% of peak cooling demand to off-peak hours. And for homes, the Ice Bear 20 replaces traditional AC units while doubling as a thermal battery.\nUnlike lithium-ion, ice batteries dont degrade chemically  their water is endlessly reusable. Combining the technology with this hack, its even possible in environments where water is scarce. But the trade-off? They only store cooling energy. No frozen kilowatts for your lightbulbs, just an efficient way to handle the biggest energy drain in most buildings.\nCould ice batteries help decentralize energy storage? Theyre already proving their worth in high-demand areas like California and Texas.

Yet what if there was a way to use a third-party client and even run it on Windows XP, Windows 95, and NT 3.1? This is exactly what [iDontProgramInCpp] did with their Discord Messenger project.\nFortunately, as a web app the Discord API is readily accessible and they dont seem to be in a rush to ban third-party clients. But it did require a bit of work to add newer versions of TLS encryption to Windows XP and older. Fortunately OpenSSL still supports these older platforms, so this was not a major hurdle and Windows XP happily ran this new Discord client. That left porting to older Windows versions.\nMost of the challenge lies in writing shims for API calls that do not exist on these older platforms when backporting software from Windows XP to older Windows versions, and GCC (MinGW) had to be used instead of MSVC, but this also was a relatively minor detail. Finally, Windows NT 3.1 was picked as the last challenge for Discord Messenger, which ran into MSVCRT runtime issues and required backporting features to the NT 3.1 version that was still part of the OS back then.\n[MattKC] covers the project in a recent video, as well as the AeroChat client which targets Windows Live Messenger fans.\u00a0 Hopefully the API that allows these projects to operate doesnt get locked down, as third-party clients like these bring their own unique advantages to the Discord ecosystem.\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044Windows\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01Discord Messenger\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "body": "Discord\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30c9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u53e4\u3044Windows\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044Windows\u3067\u52d5\u304f\uff01Discord Messenger\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- Windows XP\u304b\u3089NT 3.1\u307e\u3067\uff1aDiscord\u3092\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30c9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1aDiscord Messenger\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- TLS\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u3066\uff01\u53e4\u3044OS\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eDiscord\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8", "- MattKC\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30edOS\u7528Discord\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u88cf\u5074"]}

The 700-gram cylinder of Inconel was all that was left of a 2,360-kg battery pack that was tossed overboard from the ISS back in 2021, the rest presumably turning into air pollution just as NASA had planned. But the surviving bit was a Golden BB that managed to slam through the roof and do a fair amount of damage. At the time it happened, the Otero family was just looking for NASA to cover the cost of repairs, but now theyre looking for a little more consideration. A lawsuit filed by their attorney seeks $80,000 to cover the cost of repairs as well as compensation for the stress and impact of the event. This also seems to be about setting a precedent, since the Space Liability Convention, an agreement to which the USA is party, would require the space agency to cover damages if the debris had done damage in another country. The Oteros think the SLC should apply to US properties as well, and while we can see their point, wed advise them not to hold their breath. We suppose something like this had to happen eventually, and somehow were not surprised to see Florida Man in the headlines.\n\nThere was a little hubbub this week around the release of a study regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles relative to their meat-piloted counterparts. The headlines for the articles covering this varied widely and hilariously, ranging from autonomous vehicles only being able to drive in straight lines to AVs being safer than human-driven cars, full-stop. As always, one has to read past the headlines to get an idea of whats really going on, or perhaps even brave reading the primary literature. From our reading of the abstract, it seems like the story is more nuanced. According to an analysis of crashes involving 35,000 human-driven vehicles and 2,100 vehicles with some level of automation, AVs with SAE Level 4 automation suffered fewer accidents across the board than those without any automation. Importantly, the accidents that Level 4 vehicles do suffer are more likely to occur when the vehicle is turning just before the accident, or during low-visibility conditions such as dawn or dusk. The study also compares Level 4 automation to Level 2, which has driver assistance features like lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control, and found that Level 2 actually beats Level 4 in clear driving conditions, but loses in rainy conditions and pretty much every other driving situation.\nTheres a strange story coming out of New York regarding a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforcement action that seems a little shady. It regards a General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) repeater system used by the New York State GMRS Alliance. GMRS is sort of a ham radio lite system  theres no testing required for a license, you just pay a fee  that uses the UHF band. Repeaters are allowed, but only under specific rules, and that appears to be where things have gone wrong for the club. The repeater system they used was a linked system, which connected geographically remote repeaters stretching from the far western part of the state near Buffalo all the way to Utica. Its the linking that seems to have raised the FCCs hackles, and understandably so because it seems to run counter to the GMRS rules in section 95. But its the method of notification that seems hinky here, as the repeater custodian was contacted by email. Thats not typical behavior for the FCC, who generally send enforcement notices by certified snail mail, or just dispense with the paper altogether and knock on your door. People seem to think this is all fake news, and it may well be, but then again, the email could just have been an informal heads-up preceding a formal notice. Either way, its bad news for the GMRS fans in upstate New York who used this system to keep in touch along Interstate 90, a long and lonely stretch of road that we know all too well.\nThird times a charm? Well see when sunspot region AR3723 (n\u00e9e AR3697 n\u00e9e AR3664) makes a historic third pass around the Sun and potentially puts Earth in its crosshairs yet again. The region kicked up quite a ruckus on its first pass across the solar disk back in May with a series of X-class flares that produced stunning aurorae across almost all of North America. Pass number two saw the renamed region pass more or less quietly by, although it did launch an M-class flare on June 23 that caused radio blackouts in most of the North Atlantic basin. When AR3723 does peek out from behind the eastern limb of the Sun itll be a much-diminished version of its former Carrington-level glory, and will likely be given multiple designations thanks to fragmentation while it was hanging out on the backside. But it could still pack a punch, and even if this particular region doesnt have much juice left, it sure seems like the Sun has plenty of surprises in store for the balance of Solar Cycle 25.\nSomebody made a version of Conways Game of Life using nothing but checkboxes, which is very cool and you should check it out.\nAnd finally, weve been doing an unexpected amount of automotive DIY repairs these days, meaning we spend a lot of time trolling around for parts. Heres something we didnt expect to see offered by a national retailer, but that wed love to find a use for. If it ever comes back in stock we just might pick one up.", "title": "\u5730\u7403\u306b\u7740\u9678\u3057\u305f\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u6b8b\u9ab8\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30ea\u30c0\u306e\u5bb6\u5c4b\u306b\u885d\u7a81", "body": "\u5bb6\u65cf\u306e\u5bb6\u306e\u5c4b\u6839\u306b\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u304c\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c7\u30d6\u30ea\u304c\u885d\u7a81\u3001\u640d\u5bb3\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u305f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3067NASA\u306b\u8a34\u8a1f\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u4e00\u5bb6\u306f80,000\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u88dc\u511f\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3001USA\u304c\u6e96\u62e0\u3059\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u8cac\u4efb\u6761\u7d04\u304c\u9069\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3068\u4e3b\u5f35\u3059\u308b\u3002AV\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3084GMRS\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3082\u5831\u544a\u3002", "titles": ["\u5730\u7403\u306b\u7740\u9678\u3057\u305f\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u6b8b\u9ab8\u3001\u30d5\u30ed\u30ea\u30c0\u306e\u5bb6\u5c4b\u306b\u885d\u7a81", "\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u3068\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76", "\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u3067FCC\u304c\u884c\u3063\u305fGMRS\u30ea\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7de0\u307e\u308a", "\u592a\u967d\u9ed2\u70b9AR3723\u306e\u5730\u7403\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305fConway's Game of Life"]}

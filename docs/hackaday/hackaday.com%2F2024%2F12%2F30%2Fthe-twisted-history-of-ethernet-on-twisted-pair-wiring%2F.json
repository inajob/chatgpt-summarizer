But Ethernet didnt start with twisted pair cable. [Mark] and [Ben] at The Serial Port YouTube channel are taking a deep dive into the twisted history of Ethernet on twisted pair wiring. The earliest forms of Ethernet used RG-8 style coaxial cable. Its a thick, stiff cable requiring special vampire taps and lots of expensive equipment to operate.\nThe industry added BNC connectors and RG-58 coax for cheapernet or 10Base2. This reduced cost, but still had some issues. Anyone who worked in an office wired with 10Base2 can attest to the network drops whenever a cable was kicked out or a terminator was dropped.\nThe spark came when [Tim Rock] of ATT realized that the telephone cables already installed in offices around the world could be used for network traffic. [Tim] and a team of engineers from five different companies pitched their idea to the IEEE 802.3 committee on Feb 14, 1984.\nThe idea wasnt popular though  Companies like 3COM, and Digital Equipment Corporation had issues with the network topology and the wiring itself. It took ten years of work and a Herculean effort by IEEE committee chairwoman [Pat Thaler] to create the standard the world eventually came to know as 10Base-T. These days were running 10 Gigabit Ethernet over those same connectors.\nFor those who dont know, this video is part of a much larger series about Ethernet, covering both history and practical applications. We also covered the 40th anniversary of Ethernet in 2020.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u30da\u30a2\u914d\u7dda\u306e\u6df1\u3044\u63a2\u6c42", "body": "\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u304c\u3042\u308a\u300110Base-T\u898f\u683c\u304c\u8a95\u751f\u3057\u305f\u80cc\u666f\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u30da\u30a2\u914d\u7dda\u306e\u6df1\u3044\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u521d\u671f\u306e\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30b3\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- RJ-45\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u80cc\u5f8c\u306b\u3042\u308b10Base-T\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u96fb\u8a71\u7dda\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u767a\u898b", "- \u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e40\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\uff1a\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u306e\u4e21\u9762\u304b\u3089"]}

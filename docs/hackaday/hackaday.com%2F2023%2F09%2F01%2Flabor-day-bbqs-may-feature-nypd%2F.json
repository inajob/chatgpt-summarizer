Be sure to watch the skies for uninvited guests. Thats right, the NYPD are deploying drones over large Labor Day events and yes, even private barbecues. The strategy was announced during a briefing about J\u2019ouvert  thats a yearly Caribbean festival that marks the end of slavery. It generally brings crowds of thousands and draws a strong police presence to Brooklyn.\nWhile this particular invasion may come as a bit of a shock, this certainly isnt the first time the NYPD has deployed drones in the name of public safety or in response to emergencies. Data shows they have used them 124 times this year, which is up a staggering 31 times from the four events in 2022.\nAs you may have guessed, this has invited backlash from privacy and civil liberties advocates. One pointed out that this action flies in the face of the POST Act, a city law that requires the NYPD to provide transparency about their various surveillance tactics. The advocates cite the fact that regulations have not kept up with the proliferation of technology.\nNo matter what happens in the future with regulations, the NYPD can always crash large parties the old fashioned way. Usually, the neighbors will complain at some point, unless they were all invited.\nPhoto via Unsplash.", "title": "NYC\u304c\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3084\u30d0\u30fc\u30d9\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u306b\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u914d\u7f6e", "body": "NYC\u306e\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u8b66\u6212\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002NYPD\u304c\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u76e3\u8996\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u6d3e\u304b\u3089\u306f\u6279\u5224\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["NYC\u304c\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3084\u30d0\u30fc\u30d9\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u306b\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u914d\u7f6e", "NYPD\u3001\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u516c\u5171\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3084\u7dca\u6025\u4e8b\u614b\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u4f7f\u7528", "\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u6570\u304c\u6025\u5897\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u61f8\u5ff5\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u308b", "NYC\u306e\u5e02\u6cd5\u306b\u9055\u53cd\uff1fNYPD\u306e\u76e3\u8996\u6226\u8853\u306b\u6279\u5224\u7684\u306a\u58f0\u3082", "\u96a3\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u304c\u53f0\u7121\u3057\uff1f\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8105\u5a01\u306b\u6ce8\u610f"]}

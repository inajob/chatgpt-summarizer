Getting the most out of the hardware still presents some pitfalls though, as [Mark Stevens] found out when using one for an environmental data logger. The problem was that display, touch sensor, and SD card had different SPI busses, of which the software would only recognise two. His solution involves a simple hardware mod, which may benefit many others doing similar work.\nIts simple enough, put the LCD and SD card on the same bus, retaining their individual chip select lines. Theres a track to be cut and a bit of wiring to be done, but nothing that should tax most readers too much. Were pleased to see more work being done with this board, as it remains a promising platform, and any further advancements for it are a good thing. If youre interested in giving it a go, then weve got some inspiration for you."}

Everything from bananas forming letters to Wild West saloon lettering can be yours, plus of course our favourite, the embossed Dymo label. But theres a new kid on the novelty typeface block, and for us it sweeps all before it.\nScopin Sans is as its creator [Guy Dupont] calls it A typeface for hardware people, and its party trick is that it doesnt produce letters. Instead it forms an oscilloscope trace that displays what it would look like as serial data. Instantly your text jumps straight to 1337, and you win the internet.\nWe have shamefacedly to admit that we dont know binary ASCII by sight, so well have to take his word for it. But for the curious theres a demo from which you can amuse yourself creating traces, and if you cant recognize serial ASCII then the chances are few of the people around you can either. We take our hats off to [Guy], and its something were sure well use at some point to delight and confuse our friends. Its not the first font weve brought you, here are some more if you come from the bitmap era.", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306b\u8d08\u308b\u65b0\u611f\u899a\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u300eScopin Sans\u300f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b5\u30f3\u30ba\u306b\u98fd\u304d\u305f\u3089\u3001\u30d0\u30ca\u30ca\u3084\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30b9\u30c8\u98a8\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u306a\u3069\u3001\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u305b\u305a\u306b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u5f62\u6210\u3059\u308bScopin Sans\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30c7\u30e2\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306b\u8d08\u308b\u65b0\u611f\u899a\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u300eScopin Sans\u300f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u98fd\u304d\u305f\u3089\u8a66\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\uff01\u300eScopin Sans\u300f\u3067\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30921337\u306b\u5909\u63db", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4eba\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\uff01\u300eScopin Sans\u300f\u3067\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30eaASCII\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u5927\u4e08\u592b\uff01\u300eScopin Sans\u300f\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u6642\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff01\u898b\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3080\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u305f\u3061"]}

You\u00a0could start with the computery bits, like say the CPU or the bus architecture, but wheres the fun in that? Instead, [Boz] built a righteous blinkenlights array.\nWhats cool about this display is that its ready to go out of the box. All of the LEDs are reverse-mount and assembled by the board maker. The 19 2U PCBs serve as the front plates, so [Boz] was careful not to use any through-hole parts, which also simplified the PCB assembly, of course. Each slice has its own microcontroller and a few shift registers to get the bits lit up, and thats all there is to it. They take incoming data at 9600 baud and output blinkiness.\nRight now it pulls out its bytes from his NAS. Were not sure which bytes, and we think we see some counters in there. Anyway, it doesnt matter because its so pretty. And maybe someday the prettiness will lure [Boz] into building a retrocomputer to go under it. But honestly, wed just relax and watch the blinking lights.\n\n"}

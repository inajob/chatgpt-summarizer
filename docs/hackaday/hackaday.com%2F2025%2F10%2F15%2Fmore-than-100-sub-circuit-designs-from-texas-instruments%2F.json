If you chose to register (which is free), youll also gain access to the pair of e-books listed at the bottom of the page: Analog Engineer\u2019s Circuit Cookbook: Amplifiers and Analog Engineer\u2019s Circuit Cookbook: Data Converters. The data converter circuits can be further subdivided into analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuits.\nThere are more than 60 amplifier circuits including basic circuits, current sensing circuits, signal sources, current sources, filters, non-linear circuits (rectifiers/clamps/peak detectors), signal conditioning, comparators, sensor acquisition, audio, and integrated amplifier circuits using MSP430 microcontrollers.\nYoull also find 39 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits including low-power, small size, and cost optimized circuits; level translation and input drive circuits; low-level sensor input circuits; input protection, filtering and isolation circuits; and commonly used auxiliary circuits. Finally, there are\u00a015 digital-to-analog converter (DAC) circuits including audio outputs, auxiliary and biasing circuits, current sources, and voltage sources.\nThanks to [Lee Leduc] for letting us know over on the EEVblog Forum."}

There were other design challenges as well. For example, one regular issue was a coupling between the motor and the rest of the unit breaking repeatedly. At the speeds the compressor runs at, weak points tend to surface fairly quickly. Thats not stopping [Lets Print], however. He plans to explore other compressor designs in his quest for an effective unit.\nAttaching motor shafts to 3D printed devices can be tricky, and in the past weve seen a clever solution that is worth keeping in mind: half of a spider coupling (or jaw coupling) can be an economical and effective way to attach 3D printed things to a shaft.\nWhile blowing up a regular party balloon is still asking too much of [Lets Print]s compressor as it stands, it certainly inflates (and pops) a latex glove like nobodys business.\n\n"}

Sometimes along the way they result in discoveries with immediate application outside academia, and so it was for [Paul Bupe Jr.], whose work resulted in a rather elegant and simple bend sensor.\nThe original research came when shining light along flexible media, including a piece of transparent 3D printer filament. He noticed that when the filament was bent at a point that it was covered by a piece of electrical tape there was a reduction in transmission, and from this he was able to repeat the effect with a piece of pipe over a narrow air gap in the medium.\nPutting these at regular intervals and measuring the transmission for light sent along it, he could then detect a bend. Take three filaments with\u00a0 the air-gap-pipe sensors spaced to form a Gray code, and he could digitally read the location.\nHe appears to be developing this discovery into a product. Were not sure which is likely to be more stress, writing up his thesis, or surviving a small start-up, so we wish him luck.", "title": "\u535a\u58eb\u751f\u304c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u5c48\u66f2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "body": "\u535a\u58eb\u8ab2\u7a0b\u306e\u5b66\u751f\u306f\u3001\u6307\u5c0e\u6559\u6388\u304b\u3089\u4e0e\u3048\u3089\u308c\u305f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u9032\u8def\u306b\u6cbf\u3063\u3066\u6642\u9593\u3092\u8cbb\u3084\u3057\u3001\u5e78\u904b\u306a\u3089\u3070\u3001\u305d\u308c\u304c\u5341\u5206\u306a\u5b9f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3001\u9aea\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u629c\u304b\u305a\u306b\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\u66f8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2\u5916\u3067\u5373\u5ea7\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u535a\u58eb\u751f\u304c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u5c48\u66f2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "\u5149\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c48\u66f2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u4f01\u696d\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u54c1\u958b\u767a", "\u900f\u660e\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5149\u306e\u4f1d\u64ad\u5b9f\u9a13", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u66f2\u3052\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc"]}

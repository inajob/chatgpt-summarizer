[Maisteer] has some high-revving inline-4 motorcycle engines hes trying to put together too, but unlike 1940s Chrysler, he also has a trombone and a lot more RPMs to deal with.\nThe Chrysler flatheads were revving at a few thousand RPM their redline was almost certainly in the three-thousand range. [Maisteer] is working at 15,000 RPM, which is where the real challenge of this build lies: the trombone in the image is just for fun. He wanted to use a heavy chain to link the crankshafts, but at that rotational speed, a heavy chain becomes really heavy or at least, it feels a force many times its weight due to centrifugal force. The lietmotief of this video is a quote by an automotive engineer to the effect that chains dont work over 10,000 RPM.\nThat leads to a few problems for the intrepid not an engineer that take most of the video to deal with and ultimately doom the engine linkage for now. Not before he gets an iconic 8-cylinder sound out (plus some fire) out of a trombone, though. Of particular note is the maker-type workflow Hackaday readers will appreciate: he 3D scans the engines, CADs up parts he needs and sends away to have them CNCd and SLS printed.\nHacking motorcycle engines into cars is nothing new. Hacking them together into franken-engines is something we see less often.\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip! Remember, if you want to toot your own horn or toot about someone elses project, for that matterthe tips line is always open.\n\n"}

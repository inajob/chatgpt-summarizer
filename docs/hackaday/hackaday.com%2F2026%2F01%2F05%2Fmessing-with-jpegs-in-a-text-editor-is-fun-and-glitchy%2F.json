But who needs it  [Patrick Gillespie] explores what can be done when editing a JPEG on a raw, textual level instead.\nAs the video explains, you generally cant simply throw a JPEG into Notepad and start making changes all willy nilly. Thats because its very easy to wreck key pieces of the image format that are required to render it as an image. Particularly because Notepad likes to sanitize things like line endings which completely mess up the structure of the file. Instead, youre best off using a binary editor that will only change specific bytes in the image when you tell it to. Do this, and you can glitch out an image in all kinds of fun digital ways or ruin it completely. Your choice!\nIf youd like to tinker around with this practice, [Patrick] has made a tool for just that purpose. Jump over to the website, load the image of your choice, and play with it to your hearts content.\nThis practice is often referred to as datamoshing, which is a very cool word, or databending, which isnt nearly as good. Weve explored other file-format hacks before, too, like a single file that can be opened six different ways. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to AloofPenny for the tip!]", "title": "- JPEG\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u7de8\u96c6\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853", "body": "JPEG\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u7de8\u96c6\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3002\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- JPEG\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3067\u7de8\u96c6\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853", "- \u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u50cf\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e2\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u753b\u50cf\u7de8\u96c6\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u300c\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u753b\u50cf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u904a\u3073\u65b9"]}

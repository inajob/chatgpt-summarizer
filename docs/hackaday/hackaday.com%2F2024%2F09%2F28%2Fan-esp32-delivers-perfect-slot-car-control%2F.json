In that world the full force of modern electronics has been brought to keeping the car on the road, and as an example heres [Maker Fabio] with a cutting edge controller that has an ESP32 at its heart.\nIts obvious that a huge amount of attention has gone into both the physical design of the unit and its software, and the result speaks for itself. The trigger sits on a proper bearing, and the sensor is a Hall-effect device on the PCB. The firmware was written in the Arduino IDE, and through the trigger and a rotary encoder all of its options can be configured on a small OLED display. Individual settings can be configured for each car, and were treated to a full explanation of this in the video.\nWe are told that the files for both software and hardware will be released in due course, as this is still a work in progress for the moment. The video meanwhile provides ample demonstration, so we look forward to the release.\nIts a surprise to find relatively few projects from the slot car world on these pages, given the amount of potential there is in them for electronic improvement. Heres one from a few years ago though.\n\n\nThanks [Bri] for the tip!", "title": "\u6700\u65b0\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9", "body": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3044\u3001\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6700\u5148\u7aef\u6280\u8853\u306fESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u5668\u307e\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7269\u7406\u8a2d\u8a08\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u6ce8\u529b\u3057\u3001\u5404\u8eca\u3054\u3068\u306b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4eca\u5f8c\u3082\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u516c\u958b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u6700\u65b0\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9", "ESP32\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u5148\u7aef\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30ceIDE\u3067\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3001OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u4eca\u5f8c\u516c\u958b\u4e88\u5b9a"]}

In that world the full force of modern electronics has been brought to keeping the car on the road, and as an example heres [Maker Fabio] with a cutting edge controller that has an ESP32 at its heart.\nIts obvious that a huge amount of attention has gone into both the physical design of the unit and its software, and the result speaks for itself. The trigger sits on a proper bearing, and the sensor is a Hall-effect device on the PCB. The firmware was written in the Arduino IDE, and through the trigger and a rotary encoder all of its options can be configured on a small OLED display. Individual settings can be configured for each car, and were treated to a full explanation of this in the video.\nWe are told that the files for both software and hardware will be released in due course, as this is still a work in progress for the moment. The video meanwhile provides ample demonstration, so we look forward to the release.\nIts a surprise to find relatively few projects from the slot car world on these pages, given the amount of potential there is in them for electronic improvement. Heres one from a few years ago though.\n\n\nThanks [Bri] for the tip!"}

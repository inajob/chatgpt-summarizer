Have you considered that the X-cube need not be a cube for its entire existence? [Matt] at Matts Corner of Gem Cutting on YouTube absolutely did, which is why he ground one into a 216-facet disco ball.\u00a0\nThats the hack, really. He took something many of us have played with at our desks thinking I should do something cool with this and did something cool with it that most of us lack the tools and especially skills to even consider. Its not especially practical, but it is especially pretty. Art, in other words.\nThe shape hes using is known specifically to gemologists as Santas Little Helper II though wed probably describe it as a kind of isosphere. Faceting the cube is just a matter of grinding down the facets to create the isosphere, then polishing them to brilliance with increasingly finer grit. This is done one hemisphere at a time, so the other hemisphere can be safely held in place with the now-classic cyanoacrylate and baking soda composite. Yes, jewelers use that trick, too.\nWe were slightly worried when [Matt] dumped his finished disco ball in acetone to clean off the cyanoacrylate we havent the foggiest idea what optical-quality glue is used to hold the four prisms of an X-cube together and were a little worried acetone might soften the joints. That turned out not to be an issue, and [Matt] now has the most eye-catching sun-catcher we think weve ever seen.\nWe actually have seen suncatchers before, though admittedly its not a very popular tag around here. The closest build to this one was a so-called hypercrystal that combined an infinitiy mirror with a crystaline shape and dicloric tape for an effect as trippy as it sounds.\nWe also featured a deep-dive a while back if you want to know how these colourful, hard-to-pronounce coatings work.\n\n"}

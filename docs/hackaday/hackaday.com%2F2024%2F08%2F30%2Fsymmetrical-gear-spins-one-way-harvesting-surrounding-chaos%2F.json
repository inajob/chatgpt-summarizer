This difference in surface wettability is used to turn agitation of surrounding water into a ratcheting action, or one-way spin.\nThis kind of mechanism is known as an active Brownian ratchet, but unlike other designs, this one doesnt depend on the gear having asymmetrical geometry. Instead of an asymmetry in shape, theres an asymmetry in the gear tooth surface treatments. You may be familiar with the terms hydrophobic and hydrophilic, which come down to a difference in surface wettability. The gears teeth having one side of each is what rectifies the chaotic agitation of the surrounding water into a one-way spin. Scaled down far enough, these could conceivably act as energy-harvesting micromotors.\nWant more detail? The published paper is here, and if you think you might want to play with this idea yourself there are a few different ways to modify the surface wettability of an object. High voltage discharge (for example from a Tesla coil) can alter surface wettability, and there are off-the-shelf hydrophobic coatings weve seen used in art. Weve even seen an unusual clock that relied on the effect."}

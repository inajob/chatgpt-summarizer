After all, you only really need two things to roast coffee: heat, and constant agitation to distribute that heat evenly. While the popcorn popper provides both, its easy to end up with semi-uneven roasts, probably because the beans are mostly just spinning around and not being tossed as well as they could be. Eventually, one might want a more advanced machine, and thats where something like [Larry Cotton]s latest wobble disk roaster can step in.\nFor starters, this machine roasts more beans than the average popcorn popper in a single throw  the maximum is 350g, or just over three-quarters of a full pound, which is way more than the average popcorn machine will hold. It essentially consists of a heat gun pointed upwards at a sieve full of green coffee beans that are being constantly pushed around by a motorized wobbling disk. As the heat blows, the large metal disk does figure eights through the beans, keeping the heat nice and even. So where does the red ball come in? Its at the bottom, keeping the flying bean skins (chaff) from entering the heat guns fan motor.\nToward the end of the short video after the break, youll see a diagram showing all the parts of this roaster. If thats not enough for you, heres a build guide for a previous wobble disk roaster (PDF) that should be quite helpful in building either version.\nIf you want to see some of Larrys previous machines, weve got em. And then you can let Hackaday Editor-in-Chief [Elliot Williams] tell you all about roasting at home.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u8c46\u3092\u7119\u714e\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u666e\u901a\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u30dd\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u8c46\u3092\u7119\u714e\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u52a0\u71b1\u3068\u5747\u7b49\u306a\u71b1\u4f1d\u5c0e\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5e38\u306b\u304b\u304d\u6df7\u305c\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9032\u3093\u3060\u7119\u714e\u6a5f\u3082\u8003\u616e\u3002Larry Cotton\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u306ewobble disk roaster\u306f\u3001\u3088\u308a\u591a\u304f\u306e\u8c46\u3092\u7119\u714e\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u8c46\u3092\u7119\u714e\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30fc\u30f3\u30dd\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u7119\u714e\u306e\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1", "\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u7119\u714e\u6a5f\uff1a\u30a6\u30a9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u30a6\u30a9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u7119\u714e\u6a5f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u7119\u714e\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408"]}

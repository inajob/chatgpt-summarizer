Thats assuming, of course, you learned integration at all, and if you havent forgotten it. The premise is that most people think of performing an integral as finding the area under a curve or as the antiderivative. However, fewer people think of integration as adding up many small parts. The video asserts that studies show that students who dont understand the third definition have difficulty applying integration to real-world problems.\nWe arent sure thats true. People who write software have probably looked at numerical integration like Simpsons rule or the midpoint rule. That makes it pretty obvious that integration is summing up small bits of something. However, you usually learn that very early, so youre forgiven if you didnt get the significance of it at the time.\n\nEven if you didnt learn calculus, the video is an easy introduction to the idea of integration with practical examples drawn from basketball, archery, and more. Although there is a bit of calculus terminology, the actual problems could just as easily have been the voltage on a charging capacitor, for example.\nWe think calculus has a bad rap as being difficult when it isnt. Maybe you should take more than 20 minutes to learn it.\n"}

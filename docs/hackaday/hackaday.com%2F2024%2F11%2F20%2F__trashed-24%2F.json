Thats especially true of SDR dongles, which dont have a lot of selectivity in the HF bands. But theyre so darn cheap and fun to play with, whats a ham to do?\n[VK3YE] has an answer, in the form of this homebrew software-defined radio (SDR) helper. Its got a few features that make using a dongle like the RTL-SDR on the HF bands a little easier and a bit more pleasant. Construction is dead simple and based on what was in the junk bin and includes a potentiometer for attenuating stronger signals, a high-pass filter to tamp down stronger medium-wave broadcast stations, and a series-tuned LC circuit for each of the HF bands to provide some needed selectivity. Everything is wired together ugly-style in a metal enclosure, with a little jiggering needed to isolate the variable capacitor from ground.\nThe last two-thirds of the video below shows the helper in use on everything from the 11-meter (CB) band down to the AM bands. This would be a great addition to any hams SDR toolkit.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306aSDR\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8", "body": "SDR\u30c0\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u306e\u9078\u629e\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30d1\u30fc\u304c\u6709\u52b9\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306aSDR\u30c9\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8", "- HF\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u306eSDR\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5de5\u592b", "- \u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aSDR\u88dc\u52a9\u6a5f\u5668", "- \u5f37\u3044\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u6291\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u5909\u62b5\u6297\u4ed8\u304dHF\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc", "- SDR\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

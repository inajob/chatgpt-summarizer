Thats especially true of SDR dongles, which dont have a lot of selectivity in the HF bands. But theyre so darn cheap and fun to play with, whats a ham to do?\n[VK3YE] has an answer, in the form of this homebrew software-defined radio (SDR) helper. Its got a few features that make using a dongle like the RTL-SDR on the HF bands a little easier and a bit more pleasant. Construction is dead simple and based on what was in the junk bin and includes a potentiometer for attenuating stronger signals, a high-pass filter to tamp down stronger medium-wave broadcast stations, and a series-tuned LC circuit for each of the HF bands to provide some needed selectivity. Everything is wired together ugly-style in a metal enclosure, with a little jiggering needed to isolate the variable capacitor from ground.\nThe last two-thirds of the video below shows the helper in use on everything from the 11-meter (CB) band down to the AM bands. This would be a great addition to any hams SDR toolkit.\n\n"}

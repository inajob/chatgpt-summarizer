[neos-builder] said their vision is to create a robotics framework that is thick as a whole (we cant avoid this as the tools, drivers, etc. make it impossible to be slim and fit everyones needs), but modular by choice.\n[neos-builder] goes on to say that HORUS aims to provide developers an interface where they can focus on writing algorithms and logic, not on setting up their environments and solving configuration issues and resolving DLL hell. With HORUS instead of writing one monolithic program, you build independent nodes, connected by topics, which are run by a scheduler. If youd like to know more the documentation is extensive.\nThe list of features is far too long for us to repeat here, but one cool feature in addition to the real-time performance and modular design that jumped out at us was this systems ability to process six million messages per second, sustained. Thats a lot of messages! Another neat feature is the systems ability to freeze the environment, thereby assuring everyone on the team is using the same version of included components, no more but it works on my machine! And we should probably let you know that Python integration is a feature, connected by shared-memory inter-process communication (IPC).\nIf youre interested in robotics and/or real-time systems you should definitely be aware of HORUS. Thanks to [neos-builder] for writing in about it.

In the case of widely available window AC units you can indeed use them as designed in a window, or as [Lou] is in the process of demonstrating, as a whole-house AC unit. The main thing to keep an eye out for here is the rated capacity of the window AC unit (in British Thermal Units, square meters/feet). In this case [Lou] used a pretty beefy $600, 24,000 BTU window unit that should be good for about 1200 sqf (~111 m2) .\nMost of the modifications are pretty straightforward, with the control board needing to have its wiring extended, as well as the AC units air intake and exhaust on the indoors side. The unit is then placed outside on a stable foundation and inserted into a suitably sized hole in the side of the building, with the controllers cable running to it from indoors. For the next step, [Lou] intends to connect the air channels on the AC unit to the houses furnace ducts, to complete the whole-house AC installation.\nCompared to a regular whole-house AC unit, this DIY approach has the advantage of anyone being able to just buy and install a window AC unit, whereas whole-house AC tends to require a licensed installer and a lot of additional costs. How well [Lou]s DIY approach ends up working will hopefully be revealed in a Part 2.\n\n"}

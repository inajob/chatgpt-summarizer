A store-bought smartphone will force a number of paradigms and features onto you no matter whether you want them, and, to top it off, it will encroach on your privacy and sell your data. Its why self-built and hacker-friendly smartphone projects keep popping up, and the MikroPhone project fills a new niche for sure, with its LTE connectivity making it a promising option for all hackers frustrated with the utter state of smartphones today.\nMikroPhone is open-source in every single aspect possible, and its designed to be privacy-friendly and easy to understand. At its core is a SiFive Freedom E310, a powerful RISC-V microcontroller  allowing for a feature phone-like OS that is easy to audit and hard to get bogged down by. Youre not limited to a feature phone OS, however  on the PCB, you will find a slot for an NXP i.MX8M-based module that can run a Linux-based mobile OS of your choice. MikroPhones display and touchscreen are shared between the Linux module and the onboard MCU, a trick that reminds us of the MCH2022 badge  you get as much smartphone as you currently need, no more, no less.\nThe cool features at MikroPhones core dont end here. The MikroPhone has support for end-to-end encrypted communications, kept to its feature-phone layer, making for a high bar of privacy protection  even when the higher-power module might run an OS that you dont necessarily fully trust. Currently, MikroPhone is a development platform, resembling the PinePhones Project Dont Be Evil board back when PinePhone was just starting out, and just like with PinePhone, it wouldnt be hard to minify this platform into a pocket-friendly form-factor, either. The PinePhone has famously become a decent smartphone replacement option in the hacker world, even helping kick off a few mobile OS projects and resulting in a trove of hacks to grace our pages.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLTE\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aMikroPhone\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u3066\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fb5\u5bb3\u3084\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8ca9\u58f2\u304c\u554f\u984c\u8996\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aMikroPhone\u306f\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306b\u914d\u616e\u3057\u3001LTE\u63a5\u7d9a\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306aOS\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30c4\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aLTE\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aMikroPhone\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306b\u914d\u616e\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\uff1aMikroPhone\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff1aMikroPhone\u306e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u5411\u3051\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\uff1aMikroPhone\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306b\u7126\u70b9\uff1aMikroPhone\u306e\u7279\u5fb4"]}

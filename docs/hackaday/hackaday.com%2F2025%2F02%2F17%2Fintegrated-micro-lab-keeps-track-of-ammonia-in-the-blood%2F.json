For\u00a0[Markus Bindhammer], it caught up to him in a big way: liver disease, specifically cirrhosis. The disease has a lot of consequences, none of which are pleasant, like abnormally high ammonia concentration in the blood. So naturally, [Markus] built an ammonia analyzer to monitor his blood.\nMeasuring the amount of ammonia in blood isnt as straightforward as you think. Yes, there are a few cheap MEMS-based sensors, but they tend to be good only for qualitative measurements, and other solid-state sensors that are more quantitative tend to be pretty expensive since theyre mostly intended for industrial applications. [Marb]s approach is based on the so-called Berthelot method, which uses a two-part reagent. In the presence of ammonia (or more precisely, ammonium ions), the reagent generates a dark blue-green species that absorbs light strongly at 660 nm. Measuring the absorbance at that wavelength gives an approximation of the ammonia concentration.\n[Marb]s implementation of this process uses a two-stage reactor. The first stage heats and stirs the sample in a glass tube using a simple cartridge heater from a 3D printer head and a stirrer made from a stepper motor with a magnetic arm. Heating the sample volatilizes any ammonia in it, which mixes with room air pumped into the chamber by a small compressor. The ammonia-laden air moves to the second chamber containing the Berthelot reagent, stirred by another stepper-powered stir plate. A glass frit diffuses the gas into the reagent, and a 660-nm laser and photodiode detect any color change. The video below shows the design and construction of the micro lab along with some test runs.\nWe wish [Markus] well in his journey, of course, especially since hes been an active part of our community for years. His chemistry-related projects run the gamut from a homebrew gas chromatograph to chemical flip flops, with a lot more to boot.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u5065\u5eb7\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u30de\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u5206\u6790\u5668", "body": "\u30de\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u809d\u786c\u5909\u306e\u305f\u3081\u8840\u4e2d\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u6fc3\u5ea6\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u5065\u5eb7\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u30de\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u5206\u6790\u5668", "- \u8840\u4e2d\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u591a\u6bb5\u968e\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u691c\u51fa\u5668", "- \u30d9\u30eb\u30c6\u30ed\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u8840\u6db2\u5206\u6790\u306eDIY\u5b9f\u8df5", "- \u5316\u5b66\u3068\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30de\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

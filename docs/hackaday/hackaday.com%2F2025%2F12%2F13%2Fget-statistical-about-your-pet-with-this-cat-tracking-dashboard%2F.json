If you want to get a little more out of the relationship, consider obsessively tracking your cats basic statistics with this display from [Matthew Sylvester].\nThe build is based around the Seeedstudio ReTerminal E1001/E1002 devices\u2014basically an e-paper display with a programmable ESP32-S3 built right in. Its upon this display that you will see all kinds of feline statistics being logged and graphed. The data itself comes from smart litterboxes, with [Matthew] figuring out how to grab data on weight and litterbox usage via APIs. In particular, hes got the system working with PetKit gear as well as the Whisker Litter Robot 4. His dashboard can separately track data for four cats and merely needs the right account details to start pulling in data from the relevant cat cloud service.\nFor [Matthew], the build wasnt just a bit of fun\u2014it also proved very useful. When one of his cats had a medical issue recently, he was quickly able to pick up that something was wrong and seek the help required. Thats a pretty great result for any homebrew project. Its unrelated, too, but Gnocci is a great name for a cat, so hats off for that one.\nWeve featured some other fun cat-tracking projects over the years, too.

His latest attempt is the PDP-10, and you can see how it looks in the demo video below.\nWatching the video will remind you of every old movie or TV show youve ever seen with a computer, complete with typing noise. The PDP-10, also known as a DECsystem-10, was a mainframe computer that usually ran TOPS-10. These were technically mainframes in 1966, although the VAX eclipsed the system. By 1983 (the end of the PDP-10s run), around 1,500 had been sold, including ones that ran at Harvard, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and  of course  MIT. They also found homes at CompuServe and Tymshare.\nThe original 36-bit machine used transistors and was relatively slow. By the 1970s, newer variants used ICs or ECL and gained some speed. A cheap version using the AM2901 bit-slice CPU and a familiar 8080 controlling the system showed up in 1978 and billed itself as the worlds lowest cost mainframe.\nThe Knight terminals were very unusual for the day. They each used a PDP-11 and had impressive graphics capability compared to similar devices from the early 1970s. You can see some of that in the demo video.\nNaturally, anyone who used a PDP-10 would think a Raspberry Pi was a supercomputer, and they wouldnt be wrong. Still, these machines were the launching pad for Adventure, Zork, and Altair Basic, which spawned Microsoft.\nThe cheap version of these used bitslice which weve been talking about lately. [Oscar] is also known for the KIMUno, which we converted into a COSMAC Elf.\n"}

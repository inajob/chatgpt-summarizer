Of course, thats the glossy marketing brochure version of reality, which differed significantly from what [Tristan Ridley] experienced whilst cycling around the globe.\nAlthough initially he was rather happy with his bike, its sealed car-like Pinion gearbox and Gates carbon belt drive system, while out in the wilds of Utah he had a breakdown when the belt snapped. When the spare belt that he had carried with him for the past months also snapped minutes later after fitting it on, it made him decide to switch back to the traditional bush roller chain.\nDespite this type of chain drive tracing its roots all the way back to Leonardo da Vinci, they actually offer many advantages over the fancy carbon-fiber-reinforced polyurethane belt. Although with the Pinion gearbox the inability to use a derailleur gearing system is no big deal, [Tristan] found that the zero maintenance part of the belt was not true for less hospitable roads\n\nAnyone up for some tasty peanut butter? (Credit: Tristan Ridley, YouTube)\nA big issue was that of abrasive dust, which created a very noisy coating on the belt thatd have to be regularly cleaned off with precious water, or by having silicone lubricant sprayed on the belt. Even with all that care he found that the belt would snap after about 8,000 km, well below the rated endurance.\nWhen it came to super-sticky mud, called peanut butter mud for good reasons, he found that chains also cope much better with this, as the mud will just squeeze out of the chain and be forced off the sprocket, whereas the belt will happily keep compacting the mud onto the contact surfaces, increasing belt tension and requiring constant cleaning to not become hopelessly stuck.\nThe Utah breakdown also showed why these belts are actually very fragile: the replacement belt had been packed away folded-up for a few months at that point in the luggage, and during storage the carbon fibers had become compromised to the point where the belt just snapped after a few minutes of use. A metal chain will happily be stored away for as long as you can keep it away from corrosion, and fold up very compactly.\nAnother awesome feature of roller chains is that theyre super-modular, allowing you to carry spare links and such with you for in-the-field repairs, while even the most remote bicycle store in any country can help you out with maintenance and repairs, unlike the special and highly custom belts that need to be shipped in by courier.\nOf all the bicycle technologies that [Tristan] has used, it seems that only this drive belt has been an outright disappointment. The sealed gearbox would seem to be a massive improvement over finicky derailleurs, and hydraulic brakes are reliable and common enough that they havent been an issue so far.\nHis conclusion is that bicycle drive belts are fine if you do city driving, where they probably will last the rated kilometers, but they rapidly fall apart in even slightly adverse conditions.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u771f\u5b9f: \u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5922\u304c\u5d29\u308c\u308b", "body": "\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306f\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u3060\u304c\u3001\u904e\u9177\u306a\u72b6\u6cc1\u3067\u306f\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u304c\u4f4e\u304f\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u512a\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u771f\u5b9f: \u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5922\u304c\u5d29\u308c\u308b", "- \u30c8\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30fb\u30ea\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u5468\u3067\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u7834\u640d\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u6469\u8017\u3068\u6ce5\u306b\u5f31\u3044\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6: \u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u512a\u4f4d\u6027", "- \u96e3\u8def\u3067\u306e\u4f9d\u5b58: \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u554f\u984c", "- \u90fd\u5e02\u3068\u91ce\u5916\u3067\u306e\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03: \u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u771f\u5b9f"]}

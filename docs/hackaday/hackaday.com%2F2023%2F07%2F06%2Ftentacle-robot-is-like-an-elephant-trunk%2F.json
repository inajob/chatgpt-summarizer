What? Oh, tentacle robot arms. Got it.\nThe researchers at Westlake University in China found inspiration in elephant trunks. Elephant trunks are entirely devoid of bone but use a tubular muscle structure. By deforming certain muscles, complex motion is possible. After understanding how they work, it was just a matter of making a similar structure from artificial muscle fibers.\nThe resulting actuator uses smart materials and has eleven different morphing modes  more than other attempts to build similar structures. The fabrication sounds difficult, it involves stretching chemically reactive materials over a form with specific winding angles.\nThe fibers react to light. Depending on the configuration, the stalk can seek light or avoid light. We were hoping the Materials and Methods section would give some ideas of how to do this ourselves, but it looks like youd need some uncommon liquid crystal materials, and youd also have to work out some of the details.\nAnimatronic tentacles are usually complex cable affairs. However, we have seen some soft robots in the past, too."}

Whats fun about this Reddit thread is all of the semi-macabre concerns of surgeons who are worried about its properties matching the real thing to make practice rigs for difficult surgeries. We were initially creeped out by the idea, but now that we think about it, its entirely reassuring that surgeons have the best tools available for them to prepare, so why not 3D prints of the actual patients bones?\n[PectusSurgeon] says that the important characteristics were that it doesnt melt under the bone saw and is mechanically similar, but also that it looks right under x-ray, for fluorscopic surgery training. But at $100 per spool, you would be forgiven for looking around for substitutes. [ghostofwinter88] chimes in saying that their lab used a high-wood-content PLA, but couldnt say much more, and then got into a discussion of how different bones feel under the saw, before concluding that they eventually chose resin.\nOf course, Reddit being Reddit, the best part of the thread is the bad jokes. Plastic surgery and my insurance wouldnt cover gyroid infill and so on. We wont spoil it all for you, so enjoy.\nWhen we first read printing bones, we didnt know if they were discussing making replacement bones, or printing using actual bones in the mix. (Of course weve covered both before. This is Hackaday.)\nThanks [JohnU] for the tip!", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9aa8\u6750\uff1a\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u304c\u62b1\u304f\u61f8\u5ff5\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9aa8\u6750\u306e\u7279\u6027\u3092\u8b70\u8ad6\u3002\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u624b\u8853\u7df4\u7fd2\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u304c\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u306f\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u9aa8\u6750\uff1a\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u304c\u62b1\u304f\u61f8\u5ff5\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u9aa8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u7279\u6027", "\u624b\u8853\u8a13\u7df4\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "Reddit\u3067\u306e\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u305f\u3061\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30e2\u30e9\u30b9\u306a\u8b70\u8ad6", "\u9aa8\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\uff1a\u672c\u7269\u306b\u8fd1\u3065\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

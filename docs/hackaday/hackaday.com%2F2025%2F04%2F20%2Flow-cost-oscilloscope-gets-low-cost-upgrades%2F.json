But the cheapest ones are often cheap for a reason, and even though they work well for the price they wont stand up to more advanced equipment. But missing features dont have to stay missing forever, as its possible to augment them to get some of these features. [Tommys] project shows you one way to make a silk purse from a sows ear, at least as it relates to oscilloscopes.\nMost of the problem with these lower-cost tools is their low precision due to fewer bits of analog-digital conversion. They also tend to be quite noisy, further lowering the quality of the oscilloscope. [Tommy] is focusing his efforts on the DSO138-mini, an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 100 kHz and an effective resolution of 10 bits. The first step is to add an anti-aliasing filter to the input, which is essentially a low-pass filter that removes high frequency components of the signal, which could cause a problem due to the lower resolution of the device. After that, digital post-processing is done on the output, which removes noise caused by the systems power supply, among other things, and essentially acts as a second low-pass filter.\n\nIn part 2 of the project, [Tommy] demonstrates the effectiveness of these two methods with experimental data, showing that a good percentage of the noise on a test signal has been removed from the output. All the more impressive here is that the only additional cost besides the inexpensive oscilloscope itself is for a ceramic capacitor that costs around a dollar. We were also impressed: [Tommy] is a junior in high school!\nPresumably, you could apply these techniques to other inexpensive equipment, like this even cheaper oscilloscope based on the ESP32."}

[Vik Olliver] over at the RepRap blog has been working on getting a printer working printing down to the level of micron accuracy.\u00a0\n\nThe printer is constructed using 3D printed flexures similar to the OpenFlecture microscope. Two flexures create the XYZ movement required for the tiny movements needed for micron level printing. While still in the stages of printing simple objects, the microscopic scale of printing is incredible. [Vik] managed to print a triangular pattern in resin at a total size of 300 \u00b5m. For comparison SLA 3D printers struggle at many times that scale. Other interesting possibilities from this technology could be printing small scale circuits from conductive resins, though this might require some customization in the resin department.\u00a0\nIn addition to printing with resin, \u00b5RepRap can be seen making designs in marker ink such as our own Jolly Wrencher! At only 1.5 mm the detail is impressive especially when considering the nature of scratching away ink.\nIf you want to make your own \u00b5RepRap head over to [Vik Olliver]\u2019s GitHub. The \u00b5RepRap project has been a long going project. From the time it started the design has changed quite a bit.

Over the years weve featured more than one paper tape related project, and the latest to come out way is [ColemanJW2]s 8-bit ASCII paper tape generator.\nIts natural to expect when talking about a paper tape generator that a machine of some type will emerge, probably with a large reel of tape, a whirring mechanical punch, and a big box of paper confetti. This one however is different, because it exists in software and produces an SVG file to cut the tape with a laser cutter. Common workshop equipment in 2025, but the stuff of science fiction when paper tape was current.\nThe software is a Python script, which has a friendly GUI. It applies 8-bit ASCII to the tape, and supports control codes and ANSI escape sequences. Theres a very short demonstration video of a tape being cut, which weve placed below the break.\nIf you make any tapes this way, see if you can find a paper tape event badge to read them.\n\n\n"}

Over the years weve featured more than one paper tape related project, and the latest to come out way is [ColemanJW2]s 8-bit ASCII paper tape generator.\nIts natural to expect when talking about a paper tape generator that a machine of some type will emerge, probably with a large reel of tape, a whirring mechanical punch, and a big box of paper confetti. This one however is different, because it exists in software and produces an SVG file to cut the tape with a laser cutter. Common workshop equipment in 2025, but the stuff of science fiction when paper tape was current.\nThe software is a Python script, which has a friendly GUI. It applies 8-bit ASCII to the tape, and supports control codes and ANSI escape sequences. Theres a very short demonstration video of a tape being cut, which weve placed below the break.\nIf you make any tapes this way, see if you can find a paper tape event badge to read them.\n\n\n", "title": "- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8ASCII\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u751f\u6210\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u30028\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8ASCII\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001SVG\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8ASCII\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u4f5c\u6210", "- Python\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u751f\u6210", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

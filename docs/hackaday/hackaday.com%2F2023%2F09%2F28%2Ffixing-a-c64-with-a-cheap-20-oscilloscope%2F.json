Working on an early 1980s computer is much easier by comparison, with the fastest signals often in the single-MHz range. [Sayaka] demonstrates this by using a cheap $20 oscilloscope to troubleshoot and repair a Commodore 64.\nAfter powering it up for the first time, the C64 displays a BASIC prompt, but none of the keys seem to work. [Sayaka] did what good hackers do, and immediately disassembled it to try and figure out the problem, suspecting the CIA chip as a likely culprit.\n[Sayaka] elected to purchase a cheap DS0138 oscilloscope kit to help troubleshoot the C64. Its not the most capable thing, with a bandwidth of just 200 KHz, but its enough to do some work on an old retro machine. After probing around to check a number of signals, she noted that the CIAs pins seemed to be very oxidized and suffering poor conductivity. All it took from there was a resolder job, and the computer was repaired.\nWeve seen other cheap scopes with altogether more impressive specs, too. Video after the break. \n", "title": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u300c\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u3084\u3059\u304b\u3063\u305f\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4f5c\u8005\u306e\u610f\u898b\u3002$20\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Commodore 64\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3057\u305f\u4f8b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u306fCIAs\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u9178\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5358\u7d14\u306b\u518d\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3059\u308c\u3070\u4fee\u7406\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b", "\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u306e\u6545\u969c\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u884c\u3048\u308b", "20\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b"]}

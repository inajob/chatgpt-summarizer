But if you did, perhaps you noticed Rings Orwellian Search Party spot  the company was hoping to get customers excited about a new feature that allows them to upload a picture of their missing pet and have Ring cameras all over the neighborhood search for a visual match. Unfortunately for Ring, the response on social media wasnt quite what they expected.\nNope, dont like that.\nOne commenter on YouTube summed it up nicely: This is like the commercial they show at the beginning of a dystopian sci-fi film to quickly show people how bad things have gotten. You dont have to be some privacy expert to see how this sort of mass surveillance is a slippery slope. Many were left wondering just who or what the new system would be searching for when it wasnt busy sniffing out lost pups.\nThe folks at Wyze were quick to capitalize on the misstep, releasing their own parody ad a few days later that showed various three-letter agencies leaving rave reviews for the new feature. By Thursday, Ring announced they would be canceling a planned expansion that would have given the divisive Flock Safety access to their network of cameras. Were sure it was just a coincidence.\nSpeaking of three-letter agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced this week that they will no longer incentivize the inclusion of stop-start systems on new automobiles. The feature, which shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop, was never actually required by federal law; rather, the EPA previously awarded credits to automakers that added the feature, which would help them meet overall emission standards. Manufacturers are free to continue offering stop-start systems on their cars if they wish, but without the EPA credits, theres little benefit in doing so. Especially since, as Car and Driver notes, it seems like most manufacturers are happy to be rid of it. The feature has long been controversial with drivers as well, to the point that weve seen DIY methods to shut it off.\n\nAn incredible story ran in The Washington Post yesterday (free to read archive) thats so wild that its almost hard to believe. In fact, if it wasnt from The Washington Post, wed be sure it was some kind of conspiracy theory fanfic. The short version goes like this: a Norwegian researcher who was so confident the Havana syndrome wasnt the result of a directed energy weapon decided to prove it by not only building some sort of pulsed RF device based on leaked classified documents, but\u00a0 fired the thing at himself as a test. Were not sure what the Norwegian equivalent to the Shocked Pikachu Face meme is, but well give you one guess as to what happened.\nIf that wasnt crazy enough, the article goes on to casually mention that the US Department of Homeland Security secretly purchased a similar pulsed-energy weapon for several million dollars on the black market during the Biden administration, and is currently studying it. Despite it apparently containing Russian components, the Feds have yet to determine who actually built the thing. Youll have a hard time finding a bigger proponent for the free exchange of information than Hackaday, but even we have to admitmaybe there are some things its better we dont know about.\nPerfect for Meshtastic\nOf course, if youre looking to really maximize the effects of your black market pulsed-energy weapon, youll need to get it up high (maybe, what the hell do we know). Or perhaps youre just a radio enthusiast. In either event, if youre within driving distance of Tennessee, youll want to keep an eye on this government auction for an 80-foot-tall mobile communications tower. According to the listing posted by the Madisonville Police Department, the towable rig was built in 2016, weighs in at a little over 10,000 pounds, and has been kept in storage. It just needs some air in the tires to get it moving again.\nAs of this writing, the high bid is just $565, but with 18 days left to go on the auction, we suspect that number will be considerably higher when the gavel drops. Well check back next month to see what it sold for, and on the off-chance that any of you actually buy it, please let us know.\nIf all this talk of mass surveillance and shady government dealings has you down, perhaps a quick game of web-based Descent will lighten the mood. Its the product of a port to Three.js by [mrdoob], completed with the aid of Claude. We know many of you are critical of AI-produced code, and not without good reason, but the results in this case are pretty slick.\nFinally, well go out on a limb and guess that more than a few in the audience are fans of the film Short Circuit, which turns 40 years old this year. In celebration, an event is being planned for June in Astoria, Oregon, where parts of the movie were filmed. As if you needed any other reason to meet Steve Guttenberg, youll also get the chance to pose for pictures with Johnny 5 and sit in on QA discussions with the cast and crew. Theres even going to be licensed merch for sale, which we can only hope means youll be able to buy one of those miniature J5s from Short Circuit 2. Its not the sort of event Hackaday generally covers, but were certainly tempted.\n\n\nSee something interesting that you think would be a good fit for our weekly Links column?

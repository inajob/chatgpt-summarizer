The workflow of visualizing this data can be tedious, involving a cut-and-paste from a terminal to a CSV file. What if there were a handy all-in-one serial data visualization tool, a serial data oscilloscope, if you will? [Atomic14] has you covered, with the web serial plotter.\nIts a browser-based tool that uses the WebSerial API, so sadly if youre a Firefox user youre not invited to the party. Serial data can be plotted and exported, and there are a range of options for viewing. Behind the scenes theres some Node and React magic happening, but should you wish to avoid getting your hands dirty theres an online demo you can try.\nLooking at it were ashamed to have been labouring under a complex workflow, particularly as we find this isnt the first to appear on these pages.\n\n"}

All toolkits but one, that is, for the Wayland project keeps shooting down proposals. Most recently merge request #264 for the ext-zones protocol by [Matthias Klumpp] as it descended into a 600+ comments spree.\nThis follows on an attempt two years prior with MR#247, which was rejected despite laying out sound reasons why the session protocol of Wayland does not cover many situations. In the breakdown video of the new ext-zones protocol discussion by [Brodie Robertson] the sheer absurdity of this whole situation becomes apparent, especially since KDE and others are already working around the Wayland project with their own extensions such as via KWin, which is being used commercially in e.g. the automotive world.\nIn a January 2024 blog post [Matthias] lays out many of his reasonings and views regarding the topic, with a focus on Linux desktop application usage from a scientific application perspective. When porting a Windows-, X11- or MacOS application to Wayland runs into compatibility issues that may necessitate a complete rewrite or dropping of features, the developer is more likely to stick to X11, to not port to Linux at all, or to use what eventually will amount to Wayland forks that patch around these missing API features.\nMeanwhile X11 is definitely getting very long in the tooth, yet without it being a clean drop-in replacement it leaves many developers and end-users less than impressed. Perhaps the Wayland project should focus more on the needs of developers and end-users, and less about what it deems to be the One True Way?\n\n", "title": "Wayland\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u7ba1\u7406\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8ab2\u984c", "body": "Wayland\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u591a\u7a93\u5bfe\u5fdc\u304c\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u3067\u3001\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306e\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u5fdc\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["Wayland\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u7ba1\u7406\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8ab2\u984c", "KDE\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308bWayland\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "Wayland\u3068X11: \u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u79fb\u884c\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055", "\u958b\u767a\u8005\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308bWayland\u306e\u73fe\u72b6\u3068\u672a\u6765", "Wayland\u306e\u6539\u5584\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u63d0\u6848\u3068\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306e\u58f0"]}

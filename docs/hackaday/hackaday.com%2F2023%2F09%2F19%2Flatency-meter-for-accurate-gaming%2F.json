Even putting aside the effects from the pandemic, the affordability and accessibility has arguably never been better. Building a gaming PC can have its downsides, though, and a challenging issue to troubleshoot is input lag or input latency. This is something thats best measured with standalone hardware, and if this is an issue on your setup you may want to take a look at this latency meter.\nUnlike other measurement devices that use the time between a mouse button input and the monitors display of a bullet or shooting event, this one looks at mouse movement and the change in the scene instead. This makes it much more versatile than other methods since its independent of specific actions, and can be used in any game without any specific events needed to perform the measurement. A camera is placed on the monitors top edge and the Arduino-based device sends mouse commands to the computer while measuring the time between those commands and the shift in the image on the monitor.\nThe project is open source, so with the right hardware its possible to build one to troubleshoot latency issues or just to learn more about a particular hardware configurations behavior. Arduinos and other microcontrollers have been doing all kinds of things by pretending to be human interface devices like this for a while now. One of our favorites of late was this effects pedal that replicates musical effects on mice and keyboards."}

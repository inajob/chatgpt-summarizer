If it sounds like that stresses the metal, it does. But researchers at Fraunhofer have found a way to reduce friction protecting both the material and the tools that do the forming. The process  known as VibroDraw  uses ultrasonic vibrations at around 500 Hz.\nResearchers claim a 20% reduction in friction now, and it may be possible to go even further. With less friction, it is possible to do a deeper draw in a single stage. It also creates less heat which is good for tool life and prevents overheating lubricant. The process has a patent if you want more details. You might need to brush up on your German, though. Unsurprisingly, the vibrations are from a piezoelectric transducer.\nCopper is soft enough to use 3D printed dies. We dont know if this technique would help with that or not. Then theres hydroforming. If you have any results using ultrasonics with these or any other techniques, be sure to let us know."}

We could (and probably should?) run a whole series of posts on selecting the correct bit for the job at hand and figuring out the appropriate feeds and speeds. But before you even get to that point, theres something even more critical you need to do: hold the workpiece down so it doesnt blast off into orbit when the tool touches it.\nNow that might sound like an easy enough job, and for basic flat stock, it often is. But if youve got an oddly shaped piece of material, youll quickly realize how inadequate those trusty c-clamps really are. When you get to that point, it might time to check out these OpenSCAD hold down clamps from [ostat]. Thanks to its parametric nature, you can plug whatever dimensions you need into the script, and in a few seconds it will spit out an STL file for a bespoke clamp that you can print out and put to work.\n\nAs currently implemented, you can easily change the height, overhang, and angle of the front of the clamp. Its also possible to adjust the parameters of the rear of the clamp, but youve got fewer options there. You can also dial in the parameters for the bolt that will attach the clamp to the bed, such as the diameter and cutout length.\nIf you have OpenSCAD installed you can do it all locally, but [ostat] also has the script working with MakerWorlds online customizer if youd rather go the web route.\nNow, we know what some of you might be thinking  do I really want to hold down my work piece with a printed clamp? Having experienced first-hand the havoc that can be caused by a work piece coming loose during a milling operation, its a valid enough concern. But the beauty of being able to run these clamps off on your desktop 3D printer for a few pennies worth of plastic each is that you dont have to limit yourself to just one or two. You know the saying: many printed clamps make light the workor something like that.", "title": "CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528OpenSCAD\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "CNC\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u4e2d\u306b\u6750\u6599\u3092\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eOpenSCAD\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5b89\u4fa1\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u884c\u3048\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528OpenSCAD\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7", "\u7269\u4f53\u3092\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u7523\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u56fa\u5b9a\u7528\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7"]}

For example, Microsoft remains heavily invested in the x86 architecture and although it does have some ARM offerings, a lot of them feel a bit half-baked. So you might question why someone like [Gustave] has spent so much time getting Windows to run on unusual ARM platforms. But we dont need much of a reason to do something off-the-wall like that around these parts, so take a look at his efforts to get Windows for ARM running on a smartwatch.\nThe smartwatch in question here is a Pixel Watch 3, which normally runs a closed-source Android implementation called Wear OS. The bootloader can be unlocked, so [Gustave] took that approach to implement a few clever workarounds to get Windows to boot including adding UEFI to the watch. During the process Google updated these devices to Android 15, though, which broke some of these workarounds. The solution at that point was to fake a kernel header and re-implement UEFI and then load Windows (technically Windows PE) onto the watch.\nAlthough this project was released on April 1, and is by [Gustave]s own admission fairly ridiculous and not something he actually recommends anyone do, he does claim that its real and provides everything needed for others to run Windows on their smartwatches if they want to. Perhaps one of our readers will be brave enough to reproduce the results and post about it in the comments. In the meantime, there are a few more open options for smartwatches available if youre looking for something to tinker with instead.\nThanks to [Ruhan] for the tip!", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3067Windows\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u6311\u6226\uff1aPixel Watch 3\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b", "body": "Gustave\u6c0f\u304cPixel Watch 3\u3067Windows\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3067Windows\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u6311\u6226\uff1aPixel Watch 3\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- ARM\u3068Windows\uff1a\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "- Gustave\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aPixel Watch 3\u3067\u306eWindows PE\u5b9f\u884c", "- Android\u304b\u3089Windows\u3078\uff1a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6109\u3057\u307f\uff1a\u5947\u629c\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u6539\u9020\u306e\u5b9f\u9332"]}

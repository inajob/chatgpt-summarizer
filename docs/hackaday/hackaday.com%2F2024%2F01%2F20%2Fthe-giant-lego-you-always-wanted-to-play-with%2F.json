This has not deterred [Veranda Vikings] though, who have come up with the fantastic idea of giant LEGO bricks made from snow.\nMaking them is simplicity itself given enough depth of the white stuff, simply press the lid of one of those plastic LEGO storage bins into some fresh snowfall hard enough to compact\u00a0 your brick, and then lift clear a perfect icy 2 by 2 brick. Most of the post is devoted to the building escapades of some very happy kids, and we cant help envying them the opportunity. It appears that like the LEGO fries in the cafe at Legoland in Bilund, these bricks dont quite interlock. We think that it would be possible to press the LEGO storage lid into the bottom of them though, perhaps some readers would like to experiment.\nEither way, this is a hack to warm the hearts of readers worldwide, whether they live in a country with snow or not. Were surprised Lego themselves havent caught on to the idea, and sold giant snow-brick moulds."}

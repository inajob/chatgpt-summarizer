But for Windows 11, the goalposts seem to be changing with newer releases of the existing OS. As covered by\u00a0The Register, it appears the latest Windows 11 24H2 update might be incompatible with older machines.\nIts all down to the POPCNT CPU instruction. As shared on Twitter by [TheBobPony], the instruction appears in a number of Windows 11 system files, including kernel and USB XHCI drivers. Thus, it appears that any CPU not able to run this instruction will not be able to boot Windows 11. POPCNT was first included in AMDs Barcelona architecture in 2007, and Intels Core processors in 2008. Its an instruction for counting set bits in a word.\nUltimately, the effect is that computers with older CPUs will no longer be able to run the latest version of Windows 11. It could be as simple as Microsoft engineers enabling more modern CPU instructions at compilation time. However, given affected hardware is more than 15 years old, its perhaps likely that Microsoft is perfectly willing to cut these machines off from using the latest versions of its main operating system. Weve talked about this phenomenon before, too.\nIn any case, keep a close eye on Windows update if youre running super-old hardware. Let us know if youll be affected in the comments.\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!", "title": "\u300cWindows 11\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u53e4\u3044PC\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306a\u3057\uff01\u300d", "body": "Microsoft\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u306eWindows 11\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u53e4\u3044CPU\u3067\u306fWindows 11\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u53e4\u3044CPU\u306f\u6700\u65b0\u306eWindows 11\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cWindows 11\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u53e4\u3044PC\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306a\u3057\uff01\u300d", "\u300cWindows 11\u306e24H2\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u306f\u53e4\u3044CPU\u304c\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u306a\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "\u300cWindows 11\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u306f\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\uff1f\u300d", "\u300c\u53e4\u3044CPU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fPC\u306fWindows 11\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\uff1f\u300d", "\u300cWindows 11\u306ePOPNCNT\u547d\u4ee4\u3067\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306b\u554f\u984c\uff1f\u300d"]}

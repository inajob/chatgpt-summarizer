This is usually done by detecting several characteristic peaks or dips in a well-known light source and using these as a reference to identify other wavelengths. The most common reference for hobbyists is the pair of peaks produced by a mercury-vapor fluorescent light, but a more versatile option is a xenon-bulb light source, such as [Markus Bindhammer] made in his latest video.\nA xenon gas discharge produces a wide band of wavelengths, which makes it a useful illumination source for absorbance spectroscopy. Even better, Xenon also has several characteristic spikes in the infrared region. For his light source, [Markus] used an H7 xenon bulb meant for a vehicle headlight. The bulb sits in the center of the source, with a concave mirror behind it and a pair of converging lenses in front of it. The converging lenses focus the light onto the end of an optical cable made of PMMA to better transmit UV. A few aluminum brackets hold all the parts in place. The concave mirror is made out of a cut-open section of aluminum pipe. The entire setup is mounted inside an aluminum case, with a fan on one end for cooling. To keep stray light out of the case, a light trap covers the fan\u2019s outlet.\n[Markus] hadn\u2019t yet tested the light source with his unique spectrometer, but it looks as though it should work nicely. We\u2019ve seen a wide variety of amateur spectrometers here, but it\u2019s also illuminating to take a look at commercial scientific light sources.\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u5149\u6e90\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9  ", "body": "\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306f\u6ce2\u9577\u3092\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u8b58\u5225\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002Xenon\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u306f\u5e83\u7bc4\u306a\u6ce2\u9577\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u5149\u6e90\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9  ", "\u8eca\u7528H7\u30ad\u30bb\u30ce\u30f3\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u5149\u6e90\u4f5c\u6210  ", "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u5149\u6e90\u3068\u306f\uff1f  ", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u7528\u5149\u6e90  ", "\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u7279\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u30ad\u30bb\u30ce\u30f3\u5149\u6e90\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u8a2d\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5  "]}

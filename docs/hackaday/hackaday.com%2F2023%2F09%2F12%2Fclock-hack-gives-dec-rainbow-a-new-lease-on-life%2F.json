And machines dont get much weirder than the DEC Rainbow 100-B, sporting as it does both Z80 and 8088 microprocessors and usable as either a VT100 terminal or as a PC with either CP/M or MS-DOS. But hey  at least it got the plain beige box look right.\nWeird or not, all computers have at least a few things in common, a fact which helped [Dr. Joshua Reichard] home in on the problem with a Rainbow that was dead on arrival. After a full recapping  a prudent move given the four decades since the machine was manufactured  the machine failed to show any signs of life. The usual low-hanging diagnostic fruit didnt provide much help, as both the Z80 and 8088 CPUs seemed to be fine. It was then that [Joshua] decided to look at the heartbeat of the machine  the 24-ish MHz clock shared between the two processors  and found that it was flatlined.\nUnwilling to wait for a replacement, [Joshua] cobbled together a temporary clock from an Arduino Uno and an Si5351 clock generator. He connected the output of the card to the main board, whipped up a little code to generate the right frequency, and the nearly departed machine sprang back to life. [Dr. Reichard] characterizes this as a defibrillation of the Rainbow, and while one hates to argue with a doctor  OK, thats a lie; we push back on doctors all the time  wed say the closer medical analogy is that of fitting a temporary pacemaker while waiting for a suitable donor for a transplant.\nThis is the second recent appearance of the Rainbow on these pages  [David] over at Usagi Electric has been working on the graphics on his Rainbow lately."}

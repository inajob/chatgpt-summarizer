And machines dont get much weirder than the DEC Rainbow 100-B, sporting as it does both Z80 and 8088 microprocessors and usable as either a VT100 terminal or as a PC with either CP/M or MS-DOS. But hey  at least it got the plain beige box look right.\nWeird or not, all computers have at least a few things in common, a fact which helped [Dr. Joshua Reichard] home in on the problem with a Rainbow that was dead on arrival. After a full recapping  a prudent move given the four decades since the machine was manufactured  the machine failed to show any signs of life. The usual low-hanging diagnostic fruit didnt provide much help, as both the Z80 and 8088 CPUs seemed to be fine. It was then that [Joshua] decided to look at the heartbeat of the machine  the 24-ish MHz clock shared between the two processors  and found that it was flatlined.\nUnwilling to wait for a replacement, [Joshua] cobbled together a temporary clock from an Arduino Uno and an Si5351 clock generator. He connected the output of the card to the main board, whipped up a little code to generate the right frequency, and the nearly departed machine sprang back to life. [Dr. Reichard] characterizes this as a defibrillation of the Rainbow, and while one hates to argue with a doctor  OK, thats a lie; we push back on doctors all the time  wed say the closer medical analogy is that of fitting a temporary pacemaker while waiting for a suitable donor for a transplant.\nThis is the second recent appearance of the Rainbow on these pages  [David] over at Usagi Electric has been working on the graphics on his Rainbow lately.", "title": "DEC Rainbow 100-B: \u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u8607\u3063\u305f\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "DEC Rainbow 100-B\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Z80\u30688088\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002VT100\u7aef\u672b\u307e\u305f\u306fCP/M\u3001MS-DOS\u306ePC\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u6545\u969c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001[Joshua]\u3055\u3093\u306fArduino Uno\u3068Si5351\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u304b\u3089\u4e00\u6642\u7684\u306a\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["DEC Rainbow 100-B: \u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u8607\u3063\u305f\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30b7\u30f3: DEC Rainbow 100-B\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u4fee\u5fa9\u8853: Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDEC Rainbow 100-B\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0: DEC Rainbow 100-B\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u4ed5\u69d8\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "DEC Rainbow 100-B: \u8607\u308b\u6280\u8853\u3067\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u547d\u3092\u5439\u304d\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u308b"]}

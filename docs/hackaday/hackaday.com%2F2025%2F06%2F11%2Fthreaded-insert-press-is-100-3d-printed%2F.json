Probably the most common addition to our prints is the ubiquitous brass threaded inset, which has proven its worth time and again over the years in providing a secure screw attachment point with less hassle than a captive nut. Of course to insert these bits of machined brass, you need to press them in, and unless youve got a very good hand with a soldering iron its usually a good idea to use a press of some sort. [TimNummy]\u00a0 shows us that, ironically enough, making such a press is perfectly doable using only printed parts. Well, save for the soldering iron, of course.\nHe calls it the Superserter. Not only is it 100% printed plastic, but the entire design fits on a single 256 mm by 256 mm bed. In his case it was done on the Bambulab X1C, but its a common enough print bed size and can be printed without any supports. Its even sized to fit the popular Gridfinity standard for a neat and tidy desk and handy bin placement for the inserts.\n[TimNummy] clearly spent some time thinking about design for 3D printed manufacturing in order to create an assembly that does not need linear rails, sliders, or bearings as other press projects often do. The ironic thing is that if that same amount of effort went into other designs, it might eliminate the need for threaded inserts entirely.\nIf you havent delved into the world of threaded inserts, we put up a how-to-guide a few years ago. If youre wondering if you can get away with just printing threads, the answer is maybe we highlighted a video comparing printed threads with different inserts a while back to get you started thinking about the design limitations there.\n\n"}

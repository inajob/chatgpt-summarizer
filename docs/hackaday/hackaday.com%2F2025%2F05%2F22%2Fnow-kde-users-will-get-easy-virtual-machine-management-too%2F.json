Over recent years that has changed, with the arrival of open source graphical applications for effortless VM usage. Weve used GNOME Boxes here to make our lives a lot easier.\u00a0 Now KDE are also joining the party with Karton, a project which will deliver what looks very similar to Boxes in the KDE desktop.\nThe news comes in a post from Derek Lin, and shows us what work has already been done as well as a roadmap for future work. At the moment its in no way production ready and it only works with QEMU, but it can generate new VMs, run them, and capture their screens to a desktop window. Having no wish to join in any Linux desktop holy wars we look forward to seeing this piece of software progress, as its a Google Summer Of Code project we hope there will be plenty more to see shortly.\nStill using the commercial option? You can move to open source too!", "title": "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u7ba1\u7406\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cKarton\u300d\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "KDE\u304cKarton\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u7ba1\u7406\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u7ba1\u7406\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cKarton\u300d\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- GNOME Boxes\u306b\u7d9a\u304fKDE\u306e\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u306f", "- \u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306aOS\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eKarton\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- QEMU\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u74b0\u5883\u3001Karton\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "- \u5546\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u3001Karton\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

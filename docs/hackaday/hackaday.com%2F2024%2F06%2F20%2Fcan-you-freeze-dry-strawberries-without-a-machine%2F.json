But would you believe they taste even better in freeze-dried format? I wouldnt have ever known until I happened to get on a health kick and was looking for new things to eat. Im not sure I could have picked a more expensive snack, but thats why were here  I wanted to start freeze-drying my own strawberries.\nWhile I could have just dropped a couple grand and bought some kind of freeze-drying contraption, I just dont have that kind of money. And besides, no good Hackaday article would have come out of that. So I started looking for alternative ways of getting the job done.\nDry Ice Is Nice\nImage via Air Products\nEarly on in my web crawling on the topic, I came across this Valley Food Storage blog entry that seems to have just about all the information I could possibly want about the various methods of freeze-drying food. The one that caught my eye was the dry ice method, mostly because its only supposed to take 24 hours.\nHeres what you do, in a nutshell: wash, hull, and slice the strawberries, then put them in a resealable bag. Leave the bag open so the moisture can evaporate. Put these bags in the bottom of a large Styrofoam cooler, and lay the dry ice on top. Loosely affix the lid and wait 24 hours for the magic to happen.\nI still had some questions. Does all the moisture simply evaporate? Or will there be a puddle at the bottom of the cooler that could threaten my tangy, crispy strawberries? One important question: should I break up the dry ice? My local grocer sells it in five-pound blocks, according to their site. The freeze-drying blog suggests doing a pound-for-pound match-up of fruit and dry ice, so I guess Im freeze-drying five entire pounds of strawberries. Hopefully, this works out and I have tasty treats for a couple of weeks or months.\nPreparation\nIn order to make this go as smoothly as possible, I bought both a strawberry huller and a combination fruit and egg slicer. Five pounds of strawberries is kind of a lot, eh? Im thinking maybe I will break up the ice and try doing fewer strawberries in case its a complete failure.\nI must have gotten rid of all our Styrofoam coolers, so I called the grocery store to make sure they have them. Unfortunately, my regular store doesnt also have dry ice, but thats okay  I kind of want to be ready with my cooler when I get the dry ice and not have to negotiate buying both while also handling the ice.\nSo my plan is to go out and get the cooler and the strawberries, then come back and wash the berries. Then Ill go back out and get the dry ice and then hull and slice all the berries. In the meantime, I bought some food-safe desiccant packets that absorb moisture and change color. If this experiment works, I dont want my crispy strawberries ruined by Midwestern humidity.\n\n\n\n\n\nActually Doing the Thing\nSo I went and bought the cooler and the strawberries. They were $2.99 for a 2 lb. box, so I bought two boxes, thinking that a little more poundage in dry ice than berries would be a good thing. I went back out to the other grocery store for the dry ice, and the person in the meat department told me they sell it in pellets now, in 3- and 6-lb. bags. So I asked for the latter. All that worrying about breaking it up for nothing!\nThen it was go time. I got out my cutting board and resigned myself to hulling and slicing around 75 strawberries. But you know, it really didnt take that long, especially once I got a rhythm going. I had no idea what the volume would be like, so I started throwing the slices into a gallon-sized bag. But then it seemed like too much mass, so I ended up with them spread across five quart-sized bags. I laid them in the bottom of the cooler in layers, and poured the dry ice pellets on top. Then I took the cooler down to the basement and made note of the time.\nSince I ended up with six pounds of dry ice and only four pounds of strawberries, my intent is to check on things after 18 hours, even though its supposed to take 24. My concern is that the strawberries will get done drying out earlier than the 24-hour mark, and then start absorbing moisture from the air.\nFruits of Labor\nI decided to check the strawberries a little early. There was no way the ice was going to last 24 hours, and I think its because I purposely put the lid on upside down to make it extra loose. The strawberries are almost frozen and are quite tasty, but they are nowhere near depleted of moisture. So I decided to get more ice and keep going with the experiment.\nI went out and got another 6 lb. of pellets. This time, I layered everything, starting with ice in the bottom and ending with ice on top. This time, I put the lid on the right way, just loosely.\nTotally Not Dry, But Tasty\nWell, I checked them a few hours before the 24-hour mark, and the result looks much the same as the previous morning. Very cold berries that appear to have lost no moisture at all. They taste great, though, so I put them in the freezer to use in smoothies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, I would say that this was a good experiment. Considering I didnt have anything I needed when I started out, I would say it was fairly cost-effective as well. Heres how the pricing breaks down:\n\n28-quart Styrofoam cooler: $4.99\n4 lbs. of strawberries: $5.99\n12 lbs. of dry ice at $1.99/lb.: $24\na couple of resealable bags: $1\n\nTotal: $36, which is a little more than I paid for a big canister of freeze-dried strawberries on Amazon that lasted maybe a week. If this had worked, it would have been pretty cost-effective compared with buying them.\nSo, can you freeze-dry strawberries without a machine? Signs still point to yes, but Im going to go ahead and blame the Midwestern humidity on this one. You can bet Ill be trying this again in the winter, probably with fewer berries and smaller cooler. By the way, there was a small puddle underneath the cooler when it was all said and done.\nHave you ever tried freeze-drying anything with dry ice? If so, how did it go? Do you have any tips?

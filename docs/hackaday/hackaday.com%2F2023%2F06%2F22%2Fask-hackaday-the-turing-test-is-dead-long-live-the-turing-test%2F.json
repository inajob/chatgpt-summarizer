The idea was to have people communicate over a terminal, with another real person and with a computer. If the computer is intelligent, Turing mused, most people will incorrectly identify the computer as a human. Clearly, with the advent of modern chatbots, that test is now broken. Despite the AI moniker, chatbots arent sentient or even pre-sentient, but they certainly seem that way. An AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, is proposing a new test: The AI has to take a $100,000 budget and earn $1,000,000.\nWe were a little bemused at this. By that measure, most of us arent intelligent, either, and it seems like this is a particularly capitalistic idea. We could probably write an Excel script that studied mutual fund performance and pull off the same trick, given enough time for the investment to mature. Is it intelligent? No. Besides, even humans who have demonstrated they can make $1,000,000 often sell their companies and start new ones that fail. How often does the AI have to succeed before we grant it person status?\n\nAlan Turing never imagined chatbots when he proposed his famous test\nBut all this begs the question: What is the new test for sentience? We dont have a ready answer, and neither does science fiction. Everything from The Wizard of Oz to Star Trek has dealt with the question of when a robot or a computer is a being and not a machine.\nSentient AI and Pornography\nAs Justice Stewart famously said about pornography, I know it when I see it, perhaps the same is true here. You would be hard-pressed to say that Commander Data from Star Trek was not sentient, despite the ongoing in-story debate. But why? Because he could solve problems? Because he could love others? Because he could grow and change?\nThis is a slippery slope. Solving problems isnt enough. You need to solve problems creatively, and thats tough to define. Dogs love others, but you dont consider them truly sentient. All sorts of plants and animals grow and change, so thats not directly it, either.\nClaude Shannon Roots for the Machine\nClaude Shannon once said that it was clear machines could think because we are machines, and we think. However, it is far from clear that we understand where that indefinable quality comes from. Shannon thought the human brain had about 1010 neurons, so if we built that many electronic neurons, wed have a thinking machine. Im not so sure thats true.\nThat could be akin to someone unfamiliar with the concept of a computer saying, Of course, a motor can do computation because your printer has a motor in it, and it also clearly does computations. There may be mechanisms at work in our brains we do not yet fully understand. For example, the idea that our brains may be quantum computers is enjoying a resurgence, although the idea is still controversial.\nIBM and DARPA have been building brain-analog computers for several years as part of project SyNAPSE. At last report, there was still no true electronic brain forthcoming.\nOver to You\nSo what do you think? How can we tell if a computer is sentient or just a stochastic parrot? If you cant tell, does it matter? For that matter, can you prove that any other human being other than yourself isnt a clever simulation? Or, for that matter, can you prove it about yourself? Perhaps we should ask ChatGPT to develop a new Turing test. Or, fearing the implosion of the universe, perhaps not.", "title": "\u8ce2\u3044AI\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3092\u5224\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30a2\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u3001\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3084\u308a\u3068\u308a\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u4eba\u3005\u304c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4eba\u9593\u3060\u3068\u8aa4\u8a8d\u8b58\u3059\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306f\u77e5\u7684\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u767b\u5834\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u3082\u306f\u3084\u6a5f\u80fd\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u306eCEO\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30de\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306f\u3001AI\u304c10\u4e07\u30c9\u30eb\u306e\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u3082\u3089\u3044\u3001100\u4e07\u30c9\u30eb\u3092\u7a3c\u3050\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4f55\u304c\u77e5\u6027\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u304c\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6271\u308f\u308c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u306e\u306f\u4f55\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f", "titles": ["\u8ce2\u3044AI\u304b\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3092\u5224\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30a2\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u901a\u7528\u3057\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "\u4eba\u9593\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306b\u601d\u8003\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306e\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6a5f\u68b0\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304b\uff1f", "\u610f\u8b58\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u3068\u54f2\u5b66\uff1a\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u610f\u8b58\u306f\u53ef\u80fd\u304b\uff1f"]}

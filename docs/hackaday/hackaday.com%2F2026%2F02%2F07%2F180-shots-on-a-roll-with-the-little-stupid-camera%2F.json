Or so say the people who shoot film, anyway. It is very true though that the chemical medium has its own quirks and needs a bit of effort in a way digital cameras dont, so it can be a lot of fun to play with.\nIts expensive though  film aint cheap, and if you dont develop yourself theres an extra load of cash. What if you could get more photos on a roll? Its something [Japhy Riddle] took to extremes, creating a fifth-frame 35mm camera in which each shot is a fifth the size of the full frame.\nWere slightly worried about that much sticky tape next to the shutter, but hey.\nStandard 35mm still film has a 24x36mm frame, in modern terms not far off the size of a full-size SD card. A standard roll of film gives you 36 exposures. There are half-frame cameras that split that frame vertically to give 72 exposures, but what hes done is make a quarter-frame camera.\nIts a simple enough hack, electrical tape masking the frame except for a vertical strip in the middle, but perhaps the most interesting part is how he winds the film along by a quarter frame. 35mm cameras have a take-up reel, you wind the film out of the cartridge bit by bit into it with each shot, and then rewind the whole lot back into the cartridge at the end. Hes wound the film into the take-up reel and it winding it back a quarter frame at a time using the rewind handle, for which we are guessing he also needs a means to cock the shutter that doesnt involve the frame advance lever.\nWe like the hack, though we would be worried about adhesive tape anywhere near the shutter blind on an SLR camera. It delivers glorious widescreen at the cost of a bit of resolution, but as an experimental camera its in the best tradition. This is one to hack into an unloved 1970s snapshot camera for the Shitty Camera Challenge!\n\n"}

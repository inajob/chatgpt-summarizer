Old laptop and power tool batteries are prime sources, as these often fail because of one bad cell while the others are still perfectly usable. [limpkin] built a few of these battery packs and now that hes built a few, hes back with a new project that allows him to use four custom packs simultaneously.\nThe problem with using different battery packs in parallel is that unless the batteries are charged to similar voltages, they could generate a very high and potentially dangerous amount of current when connected in parallel. This circuit board, powered by a small ATtiny microcontroller, has four XT-60 connectors for batteries and a fifth for output. It then watches for current draw from each of the batteries and, using a set of solid-state relays, makes sure that no dangerous overcurrent conditions occur if the batteries are connected with mismatched voltages. The code for the microcontroller is available on this GitHub page as well.\nUsing an array of batteries with a balancing system like this has a number of uses, from ebikes to off-grid power solutions, and of course if you build your own packs youll also want to build a cell balancer of some sort as well. Batteries go outsidelectrical e the realm of theory and into that of chemistry, so well also provide a general warning about working in potentially dangerous situations without specialized knowledge, but you can see how [limpkin] built his original packs here if you want to take a look at one persons strategy for repurposing old cells.\n\n"}

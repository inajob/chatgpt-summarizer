[Doug MacDowell] figured that water was alright, but why not use coffee instead?\nSomeone tell us how [Doug] made this graph look like its right out of a 1970s college textbook.The concept is simple enough  replace water in a PCs cooling loop with fresh-brewed coffee. [Doug] fully integrated an entire PC build on to the side of a General Electric drip coffee maker. Its an absolute mess of tubes and wires, but its both a PC and a functional coffee maker in one.\nThe coffee maker percolates coffee as per normal into the carafe, and from there, its then pumped through two radiators on top of the PC. From there, it circulates to the water block on top of the CPU, and then back to the carafe on the coffee maker where the cycle repeats. Doug notes the coffee is initially so hot (90 C) that the PC is at risk of crashing, but after 75 minutes circulating through the system, the coffee and CPU sit at an equilibrium temperature of 33 C.\nYou cant really drink coffee from this machine. PC water cooling components are not food safe in any way, and [Doug] notes mold will become an issue over time. For short periods at least, though, its possible to sort-of-cool your computer with hot, fresh coffee if you really want to do that.\nWeve featured some great hacks of conventional coffee machines over the years, including this fantastic talk at Supercon 2023.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65ac\u65b0\u306aPC\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "PC\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u306b\u6c34\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8a66\u307f\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u8907\u96d1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65ac\u65b0\u306aPC\u51b7\u5374\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u30c9\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u5f0f\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3068PC\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3067\u51b7\u5374\uff1f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- 1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u3067\u898b\u308bPC\u51b7\u5374\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u5e38\u6e29\u5316\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u3068CPU\u306e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406"]}

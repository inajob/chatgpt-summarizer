Todays search brought up something very familiar, [Jazzy Jane] has an Advance E1 tube signal generator, the same model as the unit on the shelf above where this is being written. Its new to her, so shes giving it a teardown and fixing any safety issues before powering it on.\nFor a 70+ year old unit, the quality of these instruments was such that they remain useful and reliable to this day. Unsurprisingly a few things need looking at, such as an aged mains lead and a pair of filter caps in the power supply which havent aged well. These parts failed on the E1 here too, and while shes taking the time to order appropriate replacements we have to admit to being cheapskates and robbing parts with an appropriate working voltage for ours from a nearby PC power supply.\nWhere this one becomes rather interesting is in an extra switch and socket. Its a wafer switch with a load of capacitors, and the best guess is it provides some adjustability for the inbuilt audio oscillator which had a fixed frequency on stock models. This is part one of a series though, so were looking forward to finding out its purpose in the next installment. Take a look at the video below the break, and if thats not enough, we seem to have had more than one piece of vintage British test equipment here of late.\n\n"}

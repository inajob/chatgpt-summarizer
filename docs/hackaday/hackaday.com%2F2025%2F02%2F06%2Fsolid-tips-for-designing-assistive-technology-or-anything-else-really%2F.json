If not, make the time because this video by\u00a0[PrintLab] is chock-full of healthy and practical design tips. Its about effective design of Assistive Technology, but the design concepts extend far beyond that scope.\nIts about making things that are not just functional tools, but objects that are genuinely desirable and meaningful to peoples lives. There are going to be constraints, but constraints arent limits on creativity. Heck, some of the best devices are fantastic in their simplicity, like this magnetic spoon.\nIts not just about functionality. Colors, textures, and style are all meaningful  and have never been more accessible.\nOne item that is particularly applicable in our community is something our own [Jenny List] has talked about: dont fall into the engineer-saviour trap. The video makes a similar point in that its easy and natural to jump straight into your own ideas, but its critical not to make assumptions. What works in ones head may not work in someones actual life. The best solutions start with a solid and thorough understanding of an issue, the constraints, and details of peoples real lives.\nAnother very good point is that designs dont spring fully-formed from a workbench, so prototype freely using cardboard, models, 3D printing, or whatever else makes sense to you. Dont be stingy with your prototyping! As long as youre learning something each time, youre on the right path.\nAnd when a design is complete? It has the potential to help others, so share it! But sharing and opening your design isnt just about putting the files online. Its also about making it as easy as possible for others to recreate, integrate, or modify your work for their own needs. This may mean making clear documentation or guides, optimizing your design for ease of editing, and sharing the rationale behind your design choices to help others can build on your work effectively.\nThe whole video is excellent, and its embedded here just under the page break. Does designing assistive technology appeal to you? If so, then you may be interested in the Make:able challenge which challenges people to design and make a 3D printable product (or prototype) that improves the day-to-day life of someone with a disability, or the elderly. Be bold! You might truly help someones life.\n\n"}

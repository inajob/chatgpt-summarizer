Some reworking tasks are more difficult than others though, and we have to admit that lifting an IC pin doesnt always result in success. But with this video from [Mr. SolderFix] theres hope for conquering the technique, as he takes us through the best pin-raising technique on a variety of packages.\nThe trick it seems is to lift the pin first without attempting to disengage it from the molten solder, then returning to it with some copper braid to remove the solder and leave it raised. Once the secret is revealed its so easy, something a Hackaday scribe should be able to do. He does sound a note of caution though, as some packages are prone to disintegrating when stressed. A broken SOT-23 is not something anyone likes to see through their magnifier.\nHis channel is full of such no-nonsense soldering advice, and should be a fascinating browse for many readers. Meanwhile weve covered quite a bit of rework technique ourselves, such as last year when we looked at BGA work.\n\n", "title": "\"\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01IC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u9069\u306a\u6280\u8853\"", "body": "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u95a2\u308f\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u30ea\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u983b\u7e41\u306b\u767a\u751f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002IC\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u3001\u307e\u305a\u306f\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3089\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u96e2\u3059\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u9285\u7e4a\u7dad\u3067\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u306f\u3093\u3060\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u9664\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u70b9\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5f7c\u306e\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u306f\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u306e\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u63b2\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u300d", "titles": ["\"\u96fb\u5b50\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01IC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u9069\u306a\u6280\u8853\"", "\"\u5931\u6557\u3057\u306a\u3044\uff01IC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u3092\u6559\u3048\u307e\u3059\"", "\"\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01IC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\"", "\"\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u30ea\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3082\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01IC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u30ce\u30a6\u30cf\u30a6\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\"", "\"SOT-23\u306e\u7834\u640d\u3092\u9632\u3050\u305f\u3081\u306eIC\u30d4\u30f3\u30ea\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\""]}

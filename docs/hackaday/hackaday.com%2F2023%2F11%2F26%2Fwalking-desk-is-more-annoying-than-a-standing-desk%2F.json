The standing desk aims to solve this by keeping us in a more vertical position while we work. [Joel Creates] took this a step further by creating a walking desk thats motorized and keeps him on the move.\n[Joels] build started with a standing desk. He then pulled off the desks standard wheels, and replaced them with motors sourced from cheap second-hand hoverboards and a couple of casters. The hoverboard wheels and casters were upgraded with pneumatic tires for the sake of a smoother ride, and control is via a thumbstick mounted on a mouse. Power is via a large bank of lithium-polymer batteries which are responsible for running the motors and the computer hardware which [Joel] uses to work on the go. A solar panel canopy helps top off the batteries when hes out and about.\nAs you might imagine, a guy walking around trails with an entire computer desk draws a lot of attention. Its probably not the best way to be productive, but its a neat way to integrate exercise into your routine if youre always working at a computer. Somehow we suspect these might not catch on.

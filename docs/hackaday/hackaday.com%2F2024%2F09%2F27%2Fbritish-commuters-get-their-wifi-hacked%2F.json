Instead of being faced with the usual dont-be-naughty terms and conditions page, commuters were instead faced with a page that definitely shouldnt have been there.\nHackaday readers will immediately have guessed what is likely to have happened. This is probably more of a compromise of the page than of the network itself, and, indeed, the BBC are reporting that it may have come via an administrator account at Network Rails er network provider. Fortunately, it seems the intent was to spread a political message rather than malware, so perhaps those travelers got off lightly. The various companies involved have all got the proverbial egg on their faces, and were glad we dont work in the IT department concerned.\n\nThe question we find ourselves asking as we reflect upon this is: In crowded European commuter zones such as southern and central England, should events such as this come as a wake-up call to forgo WiFi and use a cellular data plan instead? Gone are the days when finding public WiFi was like having your own private high-speed connection, in a country blanketed by 4G and 5G networks using your phone as a hotspot is simply much faster as well as offering some security. Hackaday is written and edited on the road using a hotspot in all sorts of unlikely places. Do you do the same? Are Hackaday readers up for free public WiFi, or do you jealously guard your own connections? Let us know in the comments.\nYou can probably figure out how to share your network connection among friends. Network security, of course, is always robust until it isnt.\nheader: Biblola, CC BY-SA 3.0 .", "title": "\u9244\u9053\u99c5\u306e\u516c\u8846WiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u8d77\u304d\u305f\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u554f\u984c", "body": "\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u65b0\u805e\u306b\u3001\u9244\u9053\u99c5\u306e\u516c\u5171WiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u9055\u6cd5\u306a\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u304c\u5831\u9053\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3001WiFi\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30bb\u30eb\u30e9\u30fc\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u306e\u5229\u7528\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5b89\u5168\u3067\u901f\u3044\u3068\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u9244\u9053\u99c5\u306e\u516c\u8846WiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306b\u8d77\u304d\u305f\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u554f\u984c", "\u7dca\u6025\u4e8b\u614b\uff1f\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u901a\u52e4\u5730\u57df\u3067\u306eWiFi\u5229\u7528\u3078\u306e\u8b66\u9418", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u610f\u56f3\u306f\u653f\u6cbb\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\uff1f\u516c\u5171WiFi\u5229\u7528\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u78ba\u4fdd\u304c\u8b70\u8ad6\u3055\u308c\u308b", "IT\u90e8\u9580\u304c\u82e6\u52b4\u3059\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\uff1aWiFi\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u306f", "\u643a\u5e2f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u3092\u9078\u3079\uff1f\u82f1\u56fd\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u516c\u5171WiFi\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u5bdf"]}

The appeal of a cheap board that can run a desktop Linux distro without requiring too much battery is hard not to fall for. Over the years, the bar has been raised from a Pi stuck to the back of one of those Motorola netbook accessories, through chunky laptops, to some very svelte and professional-looking machines. A recent example comes from [Michael Mayer], whose Portable Pi 80 is a palmtop design that wed be happy to take on the road ourselves.\nAt its heart is a Pi Zero 2, combining as it does a tiny form factor with the useful power of its Pi 3-derived processor. This is mated to a Waveshare 7-inch display, and in the bottom half of the machine sits a 40% mechanical keyboard. Alongside this are a pair of 18650 cells and their associated power modules. The little Arduino, which normally handles the keyboard, has been relocated due to space constraints, which brings us to the case. A project like this one is, in many ways, a task of assembling a set of modules, and its in the case that the work here really shines. Its a 3D-printable case that you can download from Printables, and its very nice indeed. As we said, wed be happy to use one of these.\nPortable computing has come a very long way. Often the keyboard can make it or break it.", "title": "Raspberry Pi Zero 2\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30baPC\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Raspberry Pi Zero 2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u308440%\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3082\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u3084\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi Zero 2\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30baPC\u5236\u4f5c", "10\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u5b66\u3076Raspberry Pi\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9032\u5316", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7Linux\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u99c6\u52d5\u306ePortable Pi 80", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3092\u6301\u3064Raspberry Pi\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u8f1d\u304f Raspberry Pi \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf"]}

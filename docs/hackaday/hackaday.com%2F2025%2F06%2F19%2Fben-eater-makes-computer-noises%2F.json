In his latest video [Ben] shows us how to make computer noises using square waves and a 6502 microprocessor.\n[Ben] uses the timer in the W65C22 Versatile Interface Adapter to generate the square waves which generate a tone. He then adds support for a new BEEP command into his MS BASIC interpreter. We covered [Ben Eater]s MS BASIC here at Hackaday back in April, so definitely check that out if you missed it.\n\nAfter checking the frequency of oscillation using his Keysight oscilloscope he then wires in an 8\u03a9 2W speaker via a LM386 audio amplifier. We cant use the W65C22 output pin directly because that can only output a few milliwatts of power. [Ben] implements the typical circuit application from the LM386 datasheet to drive the speaker. To complete his video [Ben] writes a program for his BASIC interpreter which plays a tune.\nThanks to [Mark Stevens] for writing in to let us know about this one. If youre planning to play along at home a good place to start is to build your own 6502, like [Ben] did!\n"}

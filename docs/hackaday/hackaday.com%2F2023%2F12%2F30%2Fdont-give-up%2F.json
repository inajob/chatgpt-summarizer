And thats super invigorating.\nBut because of the pandemic, this is the first in-person conference in four years, and its been a rather unsettling time in-between. There are tons of unknowns and issues confronting us all, geeks or otherwise, at the moment. I know some people who have fallen prey to this general malaise, and become more or less cynical.\nEspecially in this context, watching a talk about an absolutely bravado hack, or falling into a conversation that sparks new ideas, can be inspiring in just the right way to pull one out of the slump. Every talk is naturally a success story  of course they are, otherwise they wouldnt be up there presenting.\nBut all of the smaller interactions, the hey-why-didnt-I-think-of-that moments or the people helping each other out with just the right trick, that give me the most hope. Thats because they are all around, and Im sure that what Im seeing is just the tip of the iceberg. So stick together, nerds, share your work, and dont give up!\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Throw on some addressable LEDs, though, and youve got something eye-catching at the very least, as [Becky] demonstrates.\nJoining the LED strands at the bottom made running the wiring easy but made walking through the blinds hard.\nThe project started with an existing beaded curtain as a base. A series of addressable LED strands were then carefully sewn to the beads using knots tied in plain sewing thread. The strands were configured as a single strand as far as the data lines were concerned, to make animation easy. Power was supplied to both ends of the strand to ensure nice and even brightness across the strands.\nThe brains of the system is a PixelBlaze controller, which makes it easy to wirelessly control the behavior of the strings. Its the perfect tool for quickly whipping up fancy animations and pretty effects without hand-assembling a bunch of code yourself.\nThere was only a few problems with the project. [Becky] found a pretty passable LED beaded curtain from China midway through the project, which reduced her enthusiasm to finish the build. There were also issues walking through the curtain due to the wiring scheme she chose, where the bottom of one strand was connected to its neighbor.\nRegardless, its a fun blinky build that brings some color to an otherwise drab doorway. Its hard to complain about that! Video after the break.\n\n"}

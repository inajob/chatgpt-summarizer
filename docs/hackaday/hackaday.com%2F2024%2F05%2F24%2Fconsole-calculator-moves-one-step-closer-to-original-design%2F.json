Or any other physical calculator, for that matter. Which is all the more reason to appreciate this\u00a0 Wang 300-series calculator consoles revival through a new electronic backend.\nIf you havent made the acquaintance of the Wang calculator series, [Bob Alexander]s previous Wang project is a perfect introduction. Despite looking very much like an overbuilt early-70s desktop calculator, what you see in the video below is just a terminal, one of four that could connect to a shared Electronics Package where most of the actual computational work was done. The package was big and is currently hard to come by, at least at a reasonable price, but the consoles, with their Nixie displays and sturdy keypads, are relatively abundant.\n[Bob]s previous venture into reviving his console involved embedding a PIC32-based controller, turning it into the standalone desktop calculator it never was. To keep more with the original design philosophy, [Bob]s second stab at the problem moves much of the same circuitry from inside the console into a dedicated outboard package, albeit one much smaller than the original. The replacement package extends and enhances the console functionality a bit, adding a real-time clock and a Nixie exercise routine to ward off the dreaded cathode poisoning. [Bob] also recreates the original Wang logarithmic method of multiplication and division, which is a nice touch with its distinctive flashing display.\nSeeing the Wang console hooked up to a package through that thick cable and Centronics connector is oddly satisfying. Wed love to see [Bob] take this to the logical extent and support multiple consoles, but that might be pushing things a bit.\n\n", "title": "\u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5316 - \u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u308b\u8a08\u7b97\u5668", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3084\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u306e\u4e2d\u3001\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u96fb\u5353\u304c\u4e0d\u8981\u306b\u3002Wang 300\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3001PIC32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3084Nixie\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u5143\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u54f2\u5b66\u3092\u4fdd\u3061\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5316 - \u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u308b\u8a08\u7b97\u5668", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee - \u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb", "\u30cb\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u7ba1\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u518d\u751f", "\u53b3\u683c\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u54f2\u5b66\u3092\u4fdd\u3061\u3064\u3064 - \u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u66f4\u65b0", "\u30ef\u30f3 300 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u96fb\u5353\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u54f2\u5b66\u518d\u8003 - \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u8ffd\u52a0"]}

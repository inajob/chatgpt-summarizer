This is a style of farming that focuses not just on a profitable farm where produce is sold at market, but also on a homestead where much of ones own food is grown on the farm as well. Like any farm, though, its extremely hard work that takes a tremendous amount of time. Automation and other technology can make a huge impact in these situations, and [Vinnie] is rolling out his own software stack to help with this on his farm.\nHe calls his project the Pi Internet of Things, or PioT, and as its name suggests is based around the Raspberry Pi. Since this will all be outdoors and exposed to the extremes of Arkansas weather, everything built under the auspices of this project prioritizes ruggedness, stability, and long-term support, all while avoiding any cloud service. The system also focuses on being able to ride through power outages. The server side, called piotserver, uses a REST API to give the user access to the automation systems through a web interface\n[Vinnie] also goes into detail about why existing systems like Home Assistant and Open Sprinkler wouldnt work in his situation, and why a ground-up solution like this is more appropriate for his farm. This post is largely an overview of his system, but some of his other posts go into more detail about things like integrating temperature sensors, rainfall monitoring, controlling irrigation systems, and plenty of other farm automation tasks that are useful for any farmer or gardener.\nWeve also seen some other projects of his here like this project which converts a common AC sprinkler system to an easier-to-use DC system, and a DIY weather station that operates in the 915 MHz band. Hes been a great resource for anyone looking to have technology help them out with their farm or garden, but if youre just getting started on your green thumb be sure to take a look at this starter guide as well.", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8fb2\u696d\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300cPioT\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "[Vinnie]\u306f\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u3067\u8fb2\u5834\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300cPioT\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8fb2\u696d\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300cPioT\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Arkansas\u3067\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u8fb2\u696d\uff1a\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30af", "\u8fb2\u696d\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u6975\u7aef\u306a\u5929\u5019\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u5805\u7262\u306a\u8fb2\u696d\u7528IoT\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u8fb2\u696d\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u7d71\u5408\u3068\u704c\u6f11\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b"]}

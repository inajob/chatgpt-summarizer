More is usually better, of course, but the MicroOffice RoadRunner managed with an 8-row, 80-column LCD screen. That may sound anemic, but in 1983, it was high-tech, as was the RoadRunner, and [Tech Time Traveller] tells us about them in a recent video you can see below.\nThe intro to the video shows some really strange old laptops before it gets to the RoadRunner. The machine used a Z80 work-alike CPU and a form of CP/M with some organizer functions. The machine didnt have floppies or other disk storage, but did have four cartridge slots that could hold more memory, a spreadsheet, BASIC, or a text editor. The memory cartridges were static RAM with battery backup, so they retained data when you pulled them from the slot. Assuming the battery didnt die.\nInside a RoadRunner cartridge.\nUnfortunately, this particular machine suffered some shipping damage. In addition to the cartridges, it also had a removable battery and modem. At around the eight-minute mark, the case comes off, and inside are  surprise  more internal cartridges.\nWhile MicroOffice isnt a household name today, it was founded by a former Exxon executive and tapped a CEO and investor from Timex. It was funded by the likes of Olivetti. The computer rolled out in late 1983 and lived until Telxon bought MicroOffice in 1985.\nAttempts to run Zork were not fruitful. There really wasnt enough memory, and file transfer was a bit wonky. If you want a modern Z80 laptop, we know of one with 16 cores. As clunky as the RoadRunner looks, it still beats the old suitcase computers.\n\n", "title": "1983\u5e74\u306eCP/M\u7aef\u672b\uff1aMicroOffice RoadRunner\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "CP/M\u7aef\u672b\u306b\u306f\u4f55\u884c\u5fc5\u8981\u304b\uff1f80\u5217LCD\u753b\u9762\u3092\u6301\u3064MicroOffice RoadRunner\u306f8\u884c\u3067\u7ba1\u7406\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002Z80\u4e92\u63dbCPU\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001CP/M\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC\u3060\u3063\u305f\u30021983\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306fTech Time Traveller\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["1983\u5e74\u306eCP/M\u7aef\u672b\uff1aMicroOffice RoadRunner\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "MicroOffice RoadRunner: Z80 CPU\u3068CP/M", "MicroOffice RoadRunner\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u69cb\u9020", "MicroOffice RoadRunner\u306e\u9769\u547d\u7684\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30e9\u30fc\uff1aMicroOffice RoadRunner"]}

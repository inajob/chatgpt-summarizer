Inspired by the relatively simplistic design, he and his friend Ben set out to build their own device to take to Galaxy\u2019s Edge in Disneyland. Armed with an arsenal of tools\u20143D printers, CNC machines, and soldering irons\u2014he aimed to turn imagination into reality.\nAfter ordering multiple walkie-talkies, they meticulously tested each one for audio quality, circuit board size, and compatibility with custom components. The world\u2019s tiniest walkie-talkie had potential but demanded creative modifications, including disassembling and resoldering components. They crafted their own circuit board and designed a 3D printed housing to fit both electronics and style. For the finishing touch, they weathered the device with paints and even glow-in-the-dark accents, making it authentic to the Star Wars universe. Even Chewbacca himself gave one a thumbs-up!\nWeathering goes a long way towards creating a convincing prop  it can turn a bundle of pipes and some foam blocks into a movie-ready WWII machine gun.\n\n"}

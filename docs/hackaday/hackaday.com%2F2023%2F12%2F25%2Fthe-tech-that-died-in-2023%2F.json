Some of the entries are a bit predictable: Twitter died to be replaced by X, which is exactly like it, only different. Others we hardly noticed, like Netflix stopping its DVD shipments.\nGoogle Glass died again, this time the enterprise edition. Amazon gave up on both donating money through shopping and print subscriptions via Kindle.\nGlass wasnt the only Google casualty. Gmail lost its basic HTML version and shut down its smart whiteboard product, Jamboard. They also sold off their Internet domain business in an effort to focus on core businesses. Other notable Google shutdowns include their popular podcast app and Usenet support for Groups. Oh, and dont forget their experiment in offering Pixels phones as a subscription. Thats done, too.\nAs you might expect, PC Magazines list is a bit consumer-oriented. What hacker-centric products and services vanished this year that youll miss? The Sculpteo Marketplace? XYZ Printing? Start up companies collapsed in 2023 at an alarming rate, but you didnt hear about most of them. Were there any you were especially disappointed about?

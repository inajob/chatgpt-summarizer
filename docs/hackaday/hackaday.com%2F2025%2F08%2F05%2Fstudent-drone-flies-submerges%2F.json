Youd get through boring classes in school by daydreaming of cool things youd like to build. If you were like us, some of them were practical, but some of them were flights of fancy. Did you ever think of an airplane that could dive under the water? We did. So did some students at Aalborg University. The difference is they built theirs. Watch it do its thing in the video below.\nAs far as we can tell, the drone utilizes variable-pitch props to generate lift in the air and downward thrust in water. In addition to the direction of the thrust, water operations require a lower pitch to minimize drag. Wed be interested in seeing how it is all waterproofed, and were unsure how deep the device can go. No word on battery life either. From the video, we arent sure how maneuverable it is while submerged, but it does seem to have some control. It wouldnt be hard to add a lateral thruster to improve underwater operations.\nThis isnt the first vehicle of its kind (discounting fictional versions). Researchers at Rutgers created something similar in 2015, and weve seen other demonstrations, but this is still very well done, especially for a student project.\nWe did see a submersible drone built using parts from a flying drone. Cool, but not quite the same.\n\n"}

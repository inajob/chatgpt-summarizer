Most of the time, it was all we had. On the other hand, there were other options if you sought them out, and [Paul Lefebvre] makes the case that Goto10Retro that Action! was the best of them.\nThe limits of BASIC as an interpreted language are well-enough known that we neednt go over them here. C and Pascal were available for some home computers in the 1980s, and programs written in those languages ran well, but compiling them? That was by no means guaranteed.\nThe text editor. Unusual for Atari at the time, it allowed scrolling along a line of greater than 40 char.\nFor those who lived on the Atari side of the fence, the Action! language provided a powerful alternative. Released by Optimized Systems Software in 1983, Action! was heavily optimized for the 6502, to the point that compiling and running simple programs with C and R felt hardly slower than typing RUN in BASIC. Thats what [Paul] writes, anyway, but its a claim that almost has to be seen to be believed.\nYou didnt just get a compiler for your money when you bought Action!, though. The cartridge came with a capable text editor, simple shell, and even a primitive debugger. (Plus, of course, a hefty manual.) Its the closest thing youd find to an IDE on a computer of that class in that era, and it all fit on a 16 kB cartridge. There was apparently also a disk release, since the disk image is available online.\nUnfortunately for those of us in Camp Commodore, the planned C-64 port never materialized, so we missed out on this language.\u00a0 Luckily our 64-bit supercomputers can easily emulate Atari 8-bit hardware and we can see what all the fuss was about. Heck, even our microcontrollers can do it.\u00a0\n", "title": "- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u300cAction!\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u306fBASIC\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001Action!\u304c\u512a\u308c\u305f\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u300cAction!\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Atari\u5c02\u7528\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- BASIC\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01Action!\u306e\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd", "- 16kB\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305fIDE\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066", "- Commodore\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3082\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Action!\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u4f53\u9a13"]}

Its useful out of the box, but also cherished for its modification potential. [OM0ET] purchased one of these capable VHF/UHF radios, but got to hacking\u2014as he wanted to use it as a desktop radio instead!\nThis might just sound like a simple reshell, but there was actually a bit of extra work involved. Most notably, the Quansheng is designed to be tuned solely by using the keypad. For desktop use, though, thats actually kind of a pain. Thus, to make life easier, [OM0ET] decided to whip up a little encoder control to handle tuning and other control tasks using an ESP32. This was achieved with help from one [OM0WT] and files for that are on Github. Other tasks involved finding a way to make the keypad work in a new housing, and how to adapt things like the audio and data module and the speaker to their new homes.\nDespite the original handheld being much smaller than the case used here, youd be surprised how tight everything fits in the case. Still, the finished result looks great. Weve seen some other adaptable and upgradable ham radio gear before, too. Sometimes custom is the way to go! Video after the break.\n\n"}

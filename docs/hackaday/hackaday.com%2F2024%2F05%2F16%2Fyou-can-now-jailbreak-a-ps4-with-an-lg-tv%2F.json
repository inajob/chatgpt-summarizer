While developing said jailbreaks was naturally no mean feat, thankfully theyre far easier for the end user to perform. These days, all you need is an LG TV.\nOf course, you cant just use any LG TV. Youll need a modern LG webOS smart TV, and youll need to jailbreak it before it can in turn be used to modify your PS4. Once thats done, though, you can install the PPLGPwn tool for jailbreaking PS4s. Its based on the PPPwn exploit released by [TheFlow], which was then optimized by [xfangxfang] and implemented for LG Smart TVs by [zauceee]. Once installed, you just need to hook up your PS4 to the TV via the Ethernet port. Then, with the exploit running on the TV, telling the PS4 to set up the LAN via PPPoE will be enough to complete the jailbreak.\nThere are other ways to jailbreak a PS4 that dont involve the use of a specific television. Nonetheless, its neat to see the hack done in such an amusing way.\n\n\nThanks to [eyeoncomputers] for the tip!"}

But if anyone does it might be [ARC385] with her Bug Bite Bot.\nA true engineering marvel, [ARC385]s bug bot extinguishes the candle on its own little birthday cupcake. Yup. Thats it! Even more peculiar, (and to be fair, somewhat fittingly) before her bug releases its less-than-crushing bite, it plays itself a little Happy Birthday jingle. Seems legit.\nIf you choose to build this little bug yourself, youll be happy to know that the electronics on this build are pretty straightforward. Servo motors control the pincers and a photoresistor detects the flame. [ARC385] tried using a flame sensor instead of the photoresistor, but mentioned she couldnt get consistent performance at her required sensing distance. She also mentions that youll probably need to calibrate the photoresistor to ambient light if for whatever reason you choose to embark on this build yourself.\n[ARC385] did a pretty good job with the laser-cut plywood to construct the bug, but using plywood adds a few more question marks to this already puzzling build. She even mentioned having to modify the pincers so they wouldnt catch fire trying to extinguish the candle.\nWould be cool if the candle could rekindle itself, but we cant possibly support making this hack even more of a fire hazard\u00a0than it already is.\n\n"}

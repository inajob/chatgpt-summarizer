This time the focus is Fedora, with sprinklings of Immutable Linux, KDE 6, and the new Linux stack of Pipewire, Portals, and Wayland. Neal gives us a rundown of what exactly makes Fedora Atomic so interesting, and why you probably dont want it running on your desktop. But in a computer lab, or on a public machine? Fedora Atomic might be exactly what you need.\nUp next theres Pipewire, the userspace sound server that replaces Pulseaudio and Jack. Should we think of Pipewire as Jack 3.0? And whats the secret to getting really reliable low-latency performance for Pipewire in Fedora? It might not be what you expect.\nTheres a popular rant online, that Wayland breaks everything. And for years, thats been a relatively accurate statement, in that Wayland hasnt been ready for prime-time. Fedora 40 has gone all in on the belief that Waylands time has come, with KDE and Gnome no longer having an X11 native option. Its Wayland all the way. And as one that has run Rawhide, I can say that the future there is bright. Literally, if you have an HDR capable monitor.\n\nSee Neals website for more information, as well as his GitHub sponsors page.\n\ufeff\nPlaces to follow the FLOSS Weekly Podcast:\n\n\n\t<!--  Google Podcasts  -->\n\t<!-- iTunes  -->\n\tSpotify\n\t<!--  Stitcher  -->\n\tRSS\n\t\t<!-- YouTube  -->\n\nDirect Download in DRM-free MP3."}

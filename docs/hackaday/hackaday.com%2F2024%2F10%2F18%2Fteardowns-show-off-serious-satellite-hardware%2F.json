Most of us have seen the inside of a computer, television, and phone. These are all common items that we come into contact with every day. Fewer of us have dived inside real spacey satellite hardware, if only for the lack of opportunity. Some good gear has landed on [Don]s desk over the years though, so he got to pulling it apart and peering inside.\n[Don] starts us off with a gorgeous box of some sort from Hughes Aircraft. He believes it to be from their Space  Communications group, and it seems to have something to do with satellite communications work. Externally, he gleans that it takes power and data hookups and outputs RF to, something but hes not entirely sure. Inside, we get a look at the old 90s electronics  lots of through hole, lots of big chunky components, and plenty of gold plating. [Don] breaks down the circuitry into various chunks and tries to make sense of it, determining that its got some high frequency RF generators in the 20 to 40 GHz range.\nScroll through the rest of [Don]s thread and youll find more gems. He pulls apart a microwave transmitter from Space Micro  a much newer unit built somewhere around 2008-2011. Then he dives into a mysterious I/O board from Broad Reach, and a very old Hughes travelling wave tube from the 1970s. The latter even has a loose link to the Ford Motor Company, believe it or not.\nEven if you dont know precisely what youre looking at, its still supremely interesting stuff\u2014and all very satellite-y. Weve seen some other neat satellite gear pulled apart before, too. Meanwhile, if youve been doing your own neat teardowns, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

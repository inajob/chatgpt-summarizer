That would mean being able to plug it into a PC and have it work as a VR headset, instead of it only working on a PS5 as Sony intended.\nEnthusiasts were initially skeptical and at times despondent about the prospects, but developer [iVRy]s efforts recently had a breakthrough. A PC-compatible VR2 is looking more likely to happen.\nSo far [iVRy] is claiming they have 6 DOF SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), Prox sensor, and stereo camera data.\nMost of the juicy bits are paywalled behind [iVRy]s Patreon.\u00a0 Were hoping the jailbreak process will eventually be open-sourced.\nThe PS VR2 headset is quite unlike a PC VR headset in a number of ways, and it has not been historically easy to work with Sonys products from a reverse-engineering perspective, whether its an attempt to improve the user experience of an annoying headset, or an attempt to understand the not-even-remotely-sanely-designed protocols behind the Sony Memory Stick. Getting the PS VR2 headset to work in a way it wasnt intended was expected to be an uphill battle.\nIts not a finished job, but judging by the progress regularly shared on [iVRy]s Twitter account, it might only be a matter of time.", "title": "PlayStation VR2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092PC\u306eVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u7740\u5b9f\u306a\u9032\u5c55", "body": "PS VR2\u304cPC\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u30026 DOF SLAM\u3001Prox\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u9032\u5c55\u304cTwitter\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u307e\u3060\u5b8c\u6210\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["PlayStation VR2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092PC\u306eVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u7740\u5b9f\u306a\u9032\u5c55", "[iVRy]\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001PC\u4e92\u63db\u306eVR2\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "[iVRy]\u304cPC\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eVR2\u306b6 DOF SLAM\u3001Prox\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3001\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u7d71\u5408", "[iVRy]\u306ePatreon\u306b\u306f\u8a73\u7d30\u304c\u591a\u6570\u63b2\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30eb\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3092\u671f\u5f85", "PS VR2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9006\u5411\u304d\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u4f34\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u9032\u5c55\u304c\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b"]}

That would mean being able to plug it into a PC and have it work as a VR headset, instead of it only working on a PS5 as Sony intended.\nEnthusiasts were initially skeptical and at times despondent about the prospects, but developer [iVRy]s efforts recently had a breakthrough. A PC-compatible VR2 is looking more likely to happen.\nSo far [iVRy] is claiming they have 6 DOF SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), Prox sensor, and stereo camera data.\nMost of the juicy bits are paywalled behind [iVRy]s Patreon.\u00a0 Were hoping the jailbreak process will eventually be open-sourced.\nThe PS VR2 headset is quite unlike a PC VR headset in a number of ways, and it has not been historically easy to work with Sonys products from a reverse-engineering perspective, whether its an attempt to improve the user experience of an annoying headset, or an attempt to understand the not-even-remotely-sanely-designed protocols behind the Sony Memory Stick. Getting the PS VR2 headset to work in a way it wasnt intended was expected to be an uphill battle.\nIts not a finished job, but judging by the progress regularly shared on [iVRy]s Twitter account, it might only be a matter of time."}

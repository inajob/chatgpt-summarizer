Itll turn your Commodore 64 into a console-like system, complete with physical game cards. Inspired by TapTo for MiSTer, this latest hack brings NFC magic to real hardware using the TeensyROM. Its been out there for a while, but it might not have caught your attention as of yet. Developed by [Sensorium] and showcased by YouTuber [StatMat], this project is a tactile, techie love letter to the past.\nAt the heart of it is the TeensyROM cartridge, which  thanks to some clever firmware modding  now supports reading NFC tags. These are writable NTag215 cards storing the path to game files on the Teensys SD card. Tap a tag to the NFC reader, and the TeensyROM boots your game. No need to fumble with LOAD *,8,1. Thats not only cool, its convenient  especially for retro demo setups.\nWhat truly sets this apart is the reintroduction of physical tokens. Each game lives on its own custom-designed card, styled after PC Engine HuCards or printed with holographic vinyl. Its a tangible, collectible gimmick that echoes the golden days of floppies and cartridges  but with 2020s tech underneath. Watch it here.\n\n"}

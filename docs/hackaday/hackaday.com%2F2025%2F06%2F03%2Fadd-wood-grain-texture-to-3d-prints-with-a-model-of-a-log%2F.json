It involves using a 3D model of a log (complete with concentric tree rings) as a print modifier. The good news is that [PandaN] has already done the work of creating one, as well as showing how to use it.\nThe model of the stump  complete with concentric tree rings  acts as a modifier for the much-smaller printed object (in this case, a small plate).\nIn the slicer software one simply uses the log as a modifier for an object to be printed. When a 3D model is used as a modifier in this way, it means different print settings get applied everywhere the object to be printed and the modifier intersect one another.\nIn the case of this project, the modifier shifts the angle of the fill pattern wherever the models intersect. A fuzzy skin modifier is used as well, and the result is enough to give a wood grain appearance to the printed object. When printed with a wood filament (which is PLA mixed with wood particles), the result looks especially good.\nWeve seen a few different ways to add textures to 3D prints, including using Blender to modify model surfaces. Textures can enhance the look of a model, and are also a good way to hide layer lines.\nIn addition to the 3D models, [PandaN] provides a ready-to-go project for Bambu slicer with all the necessary settings already configured, so experimenting can be as simple as swapping the object to be printed with a new 3D model. Want to see that in action? Heres a separate video demonstrating exactly that step-by-step, embedded below.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u6728\u76ee\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u6728\u76ee\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30ed\u30b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u4fee\u6b63\u306b\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3082\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u6728\u76ee\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u8a66\u305b\u308b3D\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u8ffd\u52a0", "- [PandaN]\u306e\u30ed\u30b0\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3067\u5370\u5237\u7269\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3092", "- Bambu\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b5\u30fc\u7528\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u30c4\u30eb\u30c4\u30eb\u306e\u5c64\u7dda\u3092\u96a0\u30593D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u5229\u70b9"]}

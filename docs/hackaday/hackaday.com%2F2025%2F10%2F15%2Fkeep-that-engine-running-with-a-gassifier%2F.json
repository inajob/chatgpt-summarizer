These are portable gas generators known as gasifiers, and to show how they work theres [Greenhill Forge] with a build video.\nA gasifier on a vintage tractor. Per Larssons Museum, CC BY 2.5.\nWhen you burn a piece of wood, you expect to see flame. But what you are looking at in that flame are the gaseous products of the wood breaking down under the heat of combustion. The gasifier carefully regulates a burn to avoid that final flame, with the flammable gasses instead being drawn off for use as fuel.\nThe chemistry is straightforward enough, with exothermic combustion producing heat, water vapour, and carbon dioxide, before a further endothermic reduction stage produces carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Hes running his system from charcoal which is close to pure carbon presumably to avoid dealing with tar, and at this stage hes not adding any steam, so were a little mystified as to where the hydrogen comes from unless there is enough water vapour in the air.\nHis retort is fabricated from sheets steel, and is followed by a cyclone and a filter drum to remove particulates from the gas. It relies on a forced air draft from a fan or a small internal combustion engine, and were surprised both how quickly it ignites and how relatively low a temperature the output gas settles at. The engine runs with a surprisingly simple gas mixer in place of a carburetor, and seems to be quite smooth in operation.\nThis is one of those devices that has fascinated us for a long time, and were grateful for the chance to see it up close. The video is below the break, and were promised a series of follow-ups as the design is refined.\n\n"}

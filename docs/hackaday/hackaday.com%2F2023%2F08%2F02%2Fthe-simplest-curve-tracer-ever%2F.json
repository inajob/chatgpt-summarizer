But as [DiodeGoneWild] explains, curve tracing really isnt all that complicated, and it doesnt even require specialized test instruments  just a transformer, a couple of resistors, and pretty much whatever oscilloscope you can lay your hands on.\nTrue to his handle, [DiodeGoneWild] concentrates on the current-voltage curves of Zener diodes in the video below, mainly as a follow-up to his recent simple linear power supply project, where he took a careful look at thermal drift to select the best Zener for the job. His curve tracer is super simple  just the device under test in series with a bunch of 10-ohm resistors and the secondary winding of a 12-volt transformer. The probes of his oscilloscope  a no-frills analog model  go across the DUT and the resistor, and with the scope in X-Y mode, the familiar current-voltage curve appears. Sure, the trace is reversed, but it still provides a good visualization of whats going on. The technique also works on digital scopes; just be ready for a lot of twiddling to get into X-Y mode and to get the trace aligned.\nOf course its not just diodes that can be tested with a curve tracer, and [DiodeGoneWild] showed a bunch of other two-lead components on his setup. But for our money, the neatest trick here was using a shorted bridge rectifier to generate a bright spot on the curve to mark the zero crossing point. Clever indeed, and pretty useful on a scope with no graticule.\n\n", "title": "\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\"\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u5c02\u9580\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u500b\u5225\u7d20\u5b50\u306e\u96fb\u6d41-\u96fb\u5727\u7279\u6027\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u96f6\u70b9\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\"", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30bc\u30ca\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u96fb\u6d41-\u96fb\u5727\u66f2\u7dda\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u7279\u5225\u306a\u8a08\u6e2c\u5668\u306a\u3057\u3067\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u884c\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u304d\u308b\u4ed6\u306e\u4e8c\u7aef\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1", "\u30ab\u30fc\u30d6\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30bc\u30ed\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6a19\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

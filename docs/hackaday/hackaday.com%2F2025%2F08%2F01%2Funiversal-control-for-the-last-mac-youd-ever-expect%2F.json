Of course you need a relatively recent version of MacOS to make it work, right? Not necessarily thanks to [Bart Jackobs] MacFriends, universal control has come to the Macintosh Classic.\nThe Arduino is perfect for this purpose, but choosing it ruined a perfectly good pun and we can never forgive that.\nWell, not exactly universal control, but similar functionality at any rate. [Bart] can slide his mouse from one side of his retina display over onto the glorious 512 x 342, 1-bit display of his Macintosh Classic, just as if the 68k powered antique was a modern device. As you might expect, the Motorola 68000 in that old Mac is getting a teensy bit of help though sadly for our love of puns, from an Arduino Nano and not any kind of Teensy.\nThe Arduino is emulating a mouse and keyboard on the Apple Desktop Bus using code based on the abduino by [akuker]. [Bart]s custom software on the modern Mac captures the mouse and keyboard inputs to pipe to the Arduino via USB serial. Apples Universal control doesnt require a wired connection between the two machines, of course, but then, it doesnt work on the Classic. One could imagine redoing this project for Bluetooth communication to have that a same Clarkian feeling of technological Apple has always wanted to convey but nothing was wireless in 1990 except for telegrams and a handful of telephones, so the project is appropriate as-is.\nAs much as we might resent that micro-controller for ruining a pun, if you want to hook into the ADB perhaps to use old peripherals with an emulated Macintosh an Arduino will do the job. So would a Teensy, though, and then wed have our pun.\nOur thanks to [Bart Jakobs] for the tip. Dont forget to send in your own: the endless maw of the tipsline is always hungry.", "title": "\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u6a5f\u80fd", "body": "\u53e4\u3044Mac\u306bArduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u6a5f\u80fd", "Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30edMac\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u5909\u308f\u308b\uff01\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd", "Apple Desktop Bus\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u53e4\u3044\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5", "Bluetooth\u901a\u4fe1\u3067\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306aApple\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

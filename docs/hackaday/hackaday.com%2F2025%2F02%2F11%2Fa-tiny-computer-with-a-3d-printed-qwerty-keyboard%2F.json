A popular device is a general purpose computer with a QWERTY keypad, and the latest of many weve seen comes from [StabbyJack]. Its a credit card sized machine whose special trick is that its keyboard is integrated in the 3D printing of its case. Weve seen rubber membranes and push in keys, but this one has flexible print-in-place keys that line up on the switches on its PCB.\nIts not complete yet but the hardware appears to be pretty much there, and aside from that keyboard it has an ESP32-S3 and a 1.9 SPI LCD. When finished it aims for an ambitious specification, with thermal camera and time-of-flight range finder hardware, along with an OS and software to suit. We like it a lot, though we suspect it might be a little small for our fingers.\nIf you like this project you may appreciate another similar one, and perhaps your version will need an OS.", "title": "- ESP32\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u591a\u76ee\u7684\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fQWERTY\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u591a\u76ee\u7684\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044ESP32-S3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u91ce\u5fc3\u7684\u306a\u4ed5\u69d8\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01\u71b1\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u8ddd\u96e2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u642d\u8f09\u8a08\u753b", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044QWERTY\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

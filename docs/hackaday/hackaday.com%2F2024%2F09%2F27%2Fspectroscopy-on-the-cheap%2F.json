The answer, of course, is to use a spectrometer, but thats an expensive piece of gear, right? Not really. Sure, these cheap devices arent perfect, but they are serviceable and, as the video below shows, there are ways to work around some of the limitations.\nThe two units in question are The Little Garden spectrometer and a TLM-2. Neither are especially sensitive, but both are well under $100, so you cant expect much. Because the spectrometers were not very sensitive, a 3D printed jig and lens were used to collect more light and block ambient light interference. The jigs also allowed the inclusion of special filters, which enhanced performance quite a bit. The neon bulbs give off the greatest glow when exposed to high voltage. Other bulbs contain things like helium, xenon, and carbon dioxide. There were also tubes with mercury vapor and even deuterium.\nWell admit it. Not everyone needs a spectrometer, but if you do, theres a lot of really interesting info on how to get the most out of these cheap devices. Apparently, [Project 326] was frustrated that he couldnt buy an X-ray spectrometer and has vowed to create one, so well be interested to see how that goes.\nSome homebrew spectrometers can get pretty fancy. Of course, theres more to spectroscopy than just optics.\n\n"}

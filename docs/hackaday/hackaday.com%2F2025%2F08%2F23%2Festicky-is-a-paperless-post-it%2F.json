[gokux] thought it would be perfect for a digital sticky note.\nUsing a Waveshare 2.9 e-paper display hooked up to a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3, a battery, and a switch all inside the 3D printed enclosure, the part count on this is about as simple as it gets. Once everything is soldered together and programmed, you get a nifty little display that can hold some of your thoughts without having to reopen an app to get to them.\nAccess is currently provided via a web page, and there are a few minor hiccups like text alignment and image upload support. This project is open source, so [gokux] has expressed interest in anyone wanting to help refine the concept. We think it might be nice to add a magnet on the back for an easier way to actually stick to things.\nIf you prefer a different way to use electricity for a sticky note, why not do it at 2,000 V? If thats not your jam, how about a plotter that writes your label or message on masking tape?\n\n", "title": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u4ed8\u7b8b\uff01E-\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u4ed8\u7b8b\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u8868\u793a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u4ed8\u7b8b\uff01E-\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Waveshare E-\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u5e33", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3068ESP32C3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30e1\u30e2\u306e\u6539\u5584\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff012,000V\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u4ed8\u7b8b\u5229\u7528\u6cd5"]}

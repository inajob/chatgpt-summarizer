[gokux] thought it would be perfect for a digital sticky note.\nUsing a Waveshare 2.9 e-paper display hooked up to a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3, a battery, and a switch all inside the 3D printed enclosure, the part count on this is about as simple as it gets. Once everything is soldered together and programmed, you get a nifty little display that can hold some of your thoughts without having to reopen an app to get to them.\nAccess is currently provided via a web page, and there are a few minor hiccups like text alignment and image upload support. This project is open source, so [gokux] has expressed interest in anyone wanting to help refine the concept. We think it might be nice to add a magnet on the back for an easier way to actually stick to things.\nIf you prefer a different way to use electricity for a sticky note, why not do it at 2,000 V? If thats not your jam, how about a plotter that writes your label or message on masking tape?\n\n"}

The TOR Snowflake project uses Pion to sneak TOR traffic through firewalls even with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) at play. Since nobody wants to block web conferencing, TOR and even Wireguard can use this to slip though.\nSean is also working on some game-changing patches for OBS Studio, including WHEP support to go along with the newly introduced WHIP feature. This enables direct connections to another OBS client, as well as connection to another WebRTC client like vdo.ninja without running an embedded browser to make it work.\nAnd then theres WebRTC For The Curious, a free CC0 e-book all about the nuts and bolts of WebRTC. And Broadcast Box, a ready-to-run WebRTC one-to-many broadcasting solution that lets you run your own streaming service. You can connect with Sean at the Real-time Broadcast Discord server for information about all of the projects listed here and more!\n\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord? Next week were interviewing Jan-Piet Mens of the OwnTracks project!\n\nDirect Download in DRM-free MP3.\nFor fans of the written word, weve got the transcript for this weeks episode right here.\nPlaces to follow the FLOSS Weekly Podcast:\n\n\n\t<!--  Google Podcasts  -->\n\t<!-- iTunes  -->\n\tSpotify\n\t<!--  Stitcher  -->\n\tRSS\n\t\t<!-- YouTube  -->\n"}

One of these was the Cabinentaxi, or C-Bahn as it was later called, which was a variation on the standard suspended and monorail concepts.\nIt was a people mover concept, with pods (or cabins) thatd ride either on top of or below the suspended track. It was tested intensively over the course of six years, performed admirably, and completely failed to materialize commercially due to budget crunch times around the world.\n\nRecently [Tim Traveller] went to the muddy farm field that once housed the big test track (pictured above), of which nothing remains but the gates and a sign. Despite the fact that few people have heard of Cabinentaxi prior to seeing [Tim]s video or reading this, there is a big Wikipedia entry on it, as well as a (German language) site dedicated to the technology.\nWhat made the C-Bahn different from trains and buses were the smaller pods, high throughput capacity and ability to call a pod on demand at any of the stations. This kind of flexibility is what is seen more or less with todays people moving systems at airports and some cities, except the C-Bahn was classified as a personal rapid transport (PRT), with on-demand pods that could travel between any two stations without stopping or delays. This is something that isnt seen with public transport today, even if self-driving cars purport to one day do this kind of trick.\nConsidering that this technology died most due to economical circumstances, we remain hopeful to see its revival one day.\n\n\n\nTop image: Cabinentaxi layout as it existed in 1978, with labels by the Tim Traveller YT channel."}

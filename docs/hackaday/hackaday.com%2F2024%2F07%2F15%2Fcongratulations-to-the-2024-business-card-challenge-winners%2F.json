But still, we were surprised by the breadth of entries! Our judges wracked their brains to pick their top ten, and then we compared notes, and three projects rose to the top, but honestly the top ten could have all won. It was a tight field. But only three of the entries get to take home the $150 DigiKey gift certificates, so without further ado\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlinkencard  Pocket Altair 8800\n[ajlitt] built a full retrocomputer, and a slick looking one to boot, in the size of a business card. Of course, you could run an Altair 8800 emulator on your cell phone, but without the entry buttons and real-live blinkenlights, it just wouldn\u2019t be the same. What our judges loved most about this build was the use of an FPGA and and ESP32, for IO and storage, the reverse-mounted front PCB that doubles as a faceplate, and of course the nice 3DP bezel that hides the bodge wires from view.\nBetaBoard  Tiny Particle Physics Lab\nSo you might have thought someone would put a retrocomputer on a business card, but a working radiation detector was not on our radar. [Tim  DJ8TK]\u2019s entry makes use of not one, but six BPW34 PIN photodiodes, which have the benefit of being well studied in the hacker radiation detection scene. This project took a ton of design work, and our judges thought that the documentation along the way were as good as any physics lecture.\nBrushless Motor and Driver Business Card Kit\nAnd speaking of educational business card demos, [Andy Geppert]\u2019s motor driver card not only teaches you how to wind your own coils and make a simple stepper motor, but also how to drive it. While [Andy] admits that the stepper motor design could use a few more poles for smooth operation, he also broke out the coil driver so that you can experiment by driving more professional brushless DC motors if you have them on hand. It\u2019s a great demo, and being in a business card form factor, you can always have one on hand.\nHonorable Mentions\nAs always, we have more awesome projects than we have prizes, so we thought we\u2019d call out some standouts.\n\nWafer Thin: [Chinchilla Optional] wowed us with this amazing dead-bug style QR code made out of LEDs. You know the card is thin when the LEDs are the thickest part. [erich.styger] contributed these RFID tag cards, beautifully laser-etched and made of 1 mm thick veneer. And bridging the Utility and Wafer Thin categories, [Maave]\u2019s credit-card sized door entry tool needs to be thin if it\u2019s going to work. Get this cut out of thin steel, and you\u2019ll never get locked out again.\nAesthetics: [BLANCHARD Jordan]\u2019s Weather Card is cool on many fronts, but the resulting circuit sculpture combining the solar panel and the e-paper really won over our judges eyes with its understated form-follows-function beauty. On the opposite end of the spectrum, [Will Fox]\u2019s Foxie CardClock 2.0 goes overboard with the color LEDs, and it looks awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadman Muntz: Earl \u201cMadman\u201d Muntz was famous for cutting corners by removing parts until the thing broke, and we had a couple standout ultra-minimalist entries. [Adam Billingsley]\u2019s CH32V003 Business Card targeted a $1 price tag, and this USB-capable, capacitive-touch card pulls out all the stops to get at least in the ballpark. Amazing. [Lincoln Uehara] cut corners by getting rid of the PCB entirely, and this makes his Back-to-basics paper business card friendly for younger builders too.\nFun and Games: A business card with a working 44 tic-tac-toe game? [Esc]\u2019s entry does double duty as a game and PCB design tutorial. Whether or not you should base your choice of a partner on skin resistance alone, [Un Kyu Lee]\u2019s Doctor Love is a hilarious device, and background story. And finally, [Eontronics]\u2019s RetroMedleyCard is an ambitious project to bring game emulation to your wallet. This project is insane, and it\u2019s one to watch!\nUtilitarian: Our last category showcases useful cards of all sorts. From [Peter]\u2019s Pi Pico MSP430 Debug Probe and programmable 4th Calculator to [Gangwa Labs]\u2019s reflow hotplate (!), there\u2019s no shortage of function that you can pack into your pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Everyone!\nAs always, we had more awesome entries than we have space to feature. You should go check out all the entries over on Hackaday.io. And thanks again to DigiKey for sponsoring these with prizes.\n \n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\uff01", "body": "Hackaday\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u3068\u3001\u60f3\u50cf\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u5e45\u5e83\u304f\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b3\u3064\u304c\u512a\u52dd\u3002\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u306fFPGA\u3084ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u9a5a\u304b\u305b\u305f\u3002\u96f7\u691c\u51fa\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3084\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30e2\u3082\u8cde\u8cdb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\uff01", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u306eRFID\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u8584\u3044QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8", "\u8d85\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3084\u5b9f\u7528\u54c1\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9"]}

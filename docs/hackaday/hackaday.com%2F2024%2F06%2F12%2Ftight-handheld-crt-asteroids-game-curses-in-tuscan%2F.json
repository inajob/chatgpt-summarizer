[Marco Vallegi] of MVV Blog\u2019s answer: two. One for the game mechanics and one for the sound effects. And the result is a sweet little retro arcade machine packed tightly into a very nicely 3D printed case.\nIf you want to learn to curse like a Tuscan sailor, you can watch the two-part video series, embedded below, in its entirety. Otherwise, we have excerpted the good stuff out of the second video for you.\nFor instance, we love the old-school voice synthesis sound of the Speak and Spell. Here, playback is implemented using the Talkie library for Arduino, and [Marco] is using the BlueWizard software on a dated Macbook for recording and encoding. (We\u2019d use the more portable Python Wizard ourselves.) Check out [Marco] tweaking the noise parameters here to get a good recording.\nAnd since the Talkie Arduino library uses PWM on a digital output pin to create the audio, the high-frequency noise was freaking out his simple transistor amplifier. Here, [Marco] adds a feedback capacitor to cancel that high-frequency hash out.\nThe build needs to be quite compact, and the stacked-Arduino-with-PCB-case design is tight. And the 3D-printed case has a number of nice refinements that you might like. We especially like the use of thin veneers that cover the case all around with the build-plate\u2019s surface texture, and the contrasting \u201cAsteroids\u201d logos are very nice.\nAll in all, this is a really fun build that\u2019s also full of little details that might help you with your own projects. Heck, even if it just encourages you to play around with the Talkie library, it\u2019s worth your time in our opinion. And while you\u2019re at it, you can turn on the subtitles and pick up some vocab that\u2019ll make your nonna roll over in her grave.\n\nPart One: Rebuilding the CRT\n\nPart Two: Adding Sound\n\nThanks [ZioTibia81] for the tip!", "title": "\u30df\u30cbCRT\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b2\u3064\u306eArduino\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "body": "\u30de\u30eb\u30b3\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u30012\u3064\u306eArduino\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5c0f\u3055\u306aCRT\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u6a5f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u3084\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30d1\u30e9\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u306a\u3069\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u304c\u6e80\u8f09\u3067\u3001Talkie\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30cbCRT\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b2\u3064\u306eArduino\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u5408\u6210\uff1aArduino\u3067\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd", "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\uff1aArduino\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u5c0f\u6280"]}

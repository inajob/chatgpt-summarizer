It goes beyond the obvious foodstuffs of pies and cakes; because there are plenty of candles, deodorants, and air fresheners ready to add a little more spice to your world. One such autumnal smell enthusiast, YouTube user [J-Knows], sought to automate the delivery mechanism with his 3D printed pumpkin spice aerosol sprayer.\nThe sprayer device uses an Arduino to rotate a small 3D printed arm that depresses the button on an air freshener cap. This design came as a result of multiple attempts to create a clip that would securely attach to a standard canister. When problems arose with the clip slipping out of place after the motor rotated, a pinch of sticky tack ended up being just the solution. With the proper amount of adhesion, the automated sprayer could now pollute any space it is in, as [J-Knows] described.\nWhat took this project to another level is the addition of an Adafruit GPS module. It was coded to respond when it was within one mile of a Starbucks  arguably the organization responsible for the pumpkin spice craze. For some the companys pumpkin spice latte (PSL) is synonymous with all things fall, and marks the beginning of the season when it is brought back to the coffee menu. Though not being a regular coffee drinker himself, [J-Knows] fully committed to the bit by taking his creation on a test trip to his local Starbucks for a PSL. Judging by the amount of pumpkin spice aerosol solution that ended up on his car dash, he is going to be smelling it into the next year.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u300c\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30b9\u300d\u81ea\u52d5\u5674\u9727\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u6280\u8853\u8005\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u8a66\u904b\u8ee2\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u300c\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30b9\u300d\u81ea\u52d5\u5674\u9727\u5668\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u9999\u308a\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u914d\u4fe1\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u79cb\u306e\u9999\u308a\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30b9\u5674\u9727\u5668\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- GPS\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u63a2\u77e5\u5f0f\u306e\u9999\u308a\u88c5\u7f6e", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u8fd1\u304f\u3067\u306e\u9999\u308a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff01\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30b9\u4f53\u9a13\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8"]}

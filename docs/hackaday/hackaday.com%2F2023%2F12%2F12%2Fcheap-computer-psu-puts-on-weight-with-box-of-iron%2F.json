For whatever reason, when handling a piece of electronics, we tend to equate heft with value.\u00a0 If something feels too light, it gives the impression of being cheap or inferior. As such, its not unheard of for gadgets to include a little chunk of metal that serves no purpose other than to add weight.\nBut a recent discovery by the aptly named [RedditCringe990] really takes things to a new low. Upon opening up the cheap power supply that came with their computer case, they noticed an odd little box that didnt appear to have any electrical connection to the rest of the device. After unscrewing it from the metal body of the power supply and pulling the bottom panel off, they found it was packed full of iron filings.\nAt some level, you have to appreciate the attention to detail here. At first glance, especially if you were peeking through the PSUs air vents, you could be forgiven for thinking the box was some kind of transformer. Its even got some alphanumeric gibberish written on the side to help complete the look. Makes us wonder how many of these things might actually have gone undetected by less curious PC-builders.\nAs you might expect, the weighted box is only one of the issues with this particular PSU. As pointed out by fellow Redditor [Hattix], even the functional components are worthy of suspicion. Theres no protection on the input or output, no safety capacitor, and (unsurprisingly) no regulatory marks.\nWed say the thing might still be useful as a boat anchor, but now that the box of iron fillings has been removed, its probably not even heavy enough.

The design uses an Arduino with an accelerometer and builds on one of their earlier projects. You can see a video of the device below.\nThe principle is simple. A hobby servo controls a pen and a stepper motor rolls paper, creating a makeshift strip recorder. Its software uses the Visuino system, which is a flowchart-like system, but it outputs Arduino code. Honestly, we would probably have just plotted the data on a PC, but theres a certain charm to the strip recorder and the idea would work for other types of data recording projects, too. We thought if you rearranged the stepper motor and cut a paper disk out, you could also have a circular chart recorder easily, which wouldnt need to friction transport the paper. A clock motor would make it even less dependent on software, too.\nIf this project interests you, try a Raspberry shake, which isnt as delicious as it sounds. Or, keep an eye on the entire globe, if you prefer.\n\n"}

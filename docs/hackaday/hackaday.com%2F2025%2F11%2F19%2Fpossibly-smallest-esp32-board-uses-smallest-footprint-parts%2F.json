In the case of [PegorK]s f32, the smallest ESP32 dev board weve seen, the cost of miniaturization is GPIO.\nTheres only one GPIO pin broken out, and its pre-wired to an LED. Thats the bad news, and depending on what you want an ESP32 for, it might not phase you at all. What is impressive here, if not the number of I/O pins, is the size of the board: at 9.85 mm x 8.45 mm barely overhangs the USB-C socket that takes up one side of the board.\nPegor provides this helpful image in the readme so you know what youre getting into with the 01005 resistors.\nIn order to get the ESP32-C3FH4 onto such a tiny board, all of the other support hardware had to be the smallest possible sizes including resistors in 01005. If you dont speak SMD, one could read that number code as oh god too small  at 0.4 mm x 0.2 mm its as minuscule as youll find and [Pegor] hand soldered them.\nOK, he did use a hot plate for the final step, but he did tin the pads manually with a soldering iron, which is still impressive. Most of us probably would have taken PCBWay up on their offer of assembly services, but not [Pegor]. Apparently part of the reason for this project was that he was looking for an excuse to use the really small footprint components.\nAside from leaving out GPIO and needing too-small SMD components, [Pegor] admits that pesky little details like antenna matching circuits and decoupling capacitors had to get cut to make the tiny footprint, so this board might be more of a stunt than anything practical. So what can you do with the smallest ESP32 board? Well, [Pegor] put up a basic web interface up to get you started blinking the built-in LED; after that, its up to you. Perhaps you might fancy a teeny-tiny minecraft server? If you can stand to increase the volume a little bit, weve seen how to hack a C3 for much better wifi performance.\nThanks to [Pegor] for the tip, and remember submit your projects, big or small, we read em all!"}

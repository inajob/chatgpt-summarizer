You may have heard of PC-98, but there were many Japanese-only computers out there, and a recent post by [Misty De Meo] asks the question: What happened to the Japanese computers?\nTo answer that question, you need a history lesson on PC-98 (NEC), FM Towns (Fujitsu), and the X68000 (Sharp). The PC-98 was originally a text-only MSDOS-based computer. But eventually, Microsoft and NEC ported Windows to the machine.\nThe FM Towns had its own GUI operating system. However, it too had a Windows port and the machine became just another Windows platform. The X68000, as you may well have guessed, used a 68000 CPU. Arguably, this was a great choice at the time. However, history shows that it didnt work out, and when Sharp began making x86-based Windows machines  and, of course, they did  there was no migration path.\n[Misty] makes an interesting point. While we often think of software like Microsoft Office as driving Windows adoption, that wasnt the case in Japan. It turns out that multitasking was the key feature since Office, at the time, wasnt very friendly to the native language.\nSo where did the Japanese computers go? The answer for two of them is: nowhere. They just morphed into commodity Windows computers. The 68000 was the exception  it just withered away.\nJapanese pocket computers were common at one time and have an interesting backstory. Japanese can be a challenge for input but, of course, hackers are up to the challenge."}

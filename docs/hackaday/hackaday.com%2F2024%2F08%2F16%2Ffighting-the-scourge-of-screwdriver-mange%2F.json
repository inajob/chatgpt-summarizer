In our opinion, the king of both these categories when it comes to screwdrivers is those clear, hard acetate plastic handles, which are a joy to use  at least until the plastic starts to degrade and exude a characteristically funky aroma.\nBut perhaps we can change that if these experiments on screwdriver mange hold up. Thats [357magdad]s unappealing but accurate description of the chemical changes that eventually occur in the strong, hard, crystal-clear handles of your favorite screwdrivers. The polymer used for these handles is cellulose acetate butyrate, or CAB, which is mostly the same cellulose acetate that replaced the more explode-y cellulose nitrate in things like pool balls and movie film, except with some of the acetate groups replaced with a little butyric acid. The polymer is fine at first, but add a little UV light and over time the outer layer of CAB decomposes into a white flaky cellulose residue while the butyric acid volatilizes, creating the characteristic odor of vomitus. Lovely.\nIn the video below, [357magdad] takes a look at different concoctions that all allegedly cure the mange. TL, DW; it was a dunk in household ammonia that performed the best, well ahead of other common agents like vinegar and bleach. The ammonia  or more precisely, ammonium hydroxide  works very quickly on the cellulose residue, dissolving it readily and leaving the handle mange-free and looking nearly new after some light scrubbing. None of the other agents came close, although acetone did manage to clear up the mange a bit, at the cost of softening the underlying CAB in a process thats probably similar to acetone smoothing ABS prints.\nAs for the funky smell, well, the results were less encouraging. Nothing really got rid of the pukey smell, even a roll in baking soda. We suspect there wont be much for that, since humans can detect it down to 10 parts per million. Consider it the price to pay for a nice-looking screwdriver that feels so good in your hand.\n", "title": "\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u52a3\u5316\u3092\u9632\u3050: \u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u5206\u6790", "body": "\u900f\u660e\u3067\u786c\u3044\u30a2\u30bb\u30c6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u304c\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u6642\u9593\u304c\u7d4c\u3064\u3068\u7570\u81ed\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3002celulose acetate butyrate(CAB)\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306b\u9664\u53bb\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30cb\u30aa\u30a4\u306f\u96e3\u89e3\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u52a3\u5316\u3092\u9632\u3050: \u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u5206\u6790", "\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u7570\u81ed\u3001\u305d\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30b1\u30a2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u691c\u8a3c", "UV\u5149\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u52a3\u5316\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30a2\u30f3\u30e2\u30cb\u30a2\u304c\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u6709\u52b9"]}

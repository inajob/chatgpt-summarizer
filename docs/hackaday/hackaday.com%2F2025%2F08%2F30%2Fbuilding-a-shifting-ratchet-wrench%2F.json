To overcome these limitations, he designed his own adjustable ratchet wrench.\nThe adjustment mechanism is based on a pair of plates with opposing slots; the wrench faces are mounted on pins which fit into these slots, and one plate rotates relative to the other, the faces slide inwards or outwards. A significant advantage of this design is that, since one plate is attached to the wrench\u2019s handle, some of the torque applied to the wrench tightens its grip on the bolt. To let the wrench loosen as well as tighten bolts, [Trevor] simply mirrored the mechanism on the other side of the wrench. Manufacturing proved to be quite a challenge: laser cutting wasn\u2019t precise enough for critical parts, and CNC control interpolation resulted in some rough curves which caused the mechanism to bind, but after numerous iterations, [Trevor] finally got a working tool.\nTo use the wrench, you twist an outer ring to open the jaws, place them over the bolt, then let them snap shut. One nice touch is that you can close this wrench over a bolt, let go of it, and do something else without the wrench falling off the bolt. Recessed bolts were a bit of an issue, but a chamfer ought to improve this. It probably won\u2019t be replacing your socket set, but it looks like it could make the odd job more enjoyable.\nIf you prefer a more conventional shifting wrench, you can make a miniature out of an M20 nut. It\u2019s also possible to make a shifting Allen wrench.\n\n\nThanks to [Adam Foley] for the tip!"}

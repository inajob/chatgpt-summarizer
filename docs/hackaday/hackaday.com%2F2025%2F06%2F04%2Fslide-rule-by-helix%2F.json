[Chris Staecker] likes them, too, and recently even 3D printed a version. But spurred by comments on his video, he decided to try something that might be unique: a helical slide rule. You can see how it works in the video below.\nWith a conventional slide rule, the scale is rotated around a cylinder so that it is the same length as a much longer linear scale. However, this new slide rule bends the entire rule around a cylinder and allows the slide to move, just like a conventional slide rule. If you have a 3D printer, you can make your own.\n\nIs it better? That depends on your definition of better. It isnt as accurate as a normal cylindrical rule. But it is novel and smaller than an equivalent conventional rule, so thats better in some way.\nIf you want to make your own conventional cylindrical rule, [Chris] did the work for you already. Dont know about slide rules at all? Maybe start here.\n", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u767a\u60f3\u306e\u30d8\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u87ba\u65cb\u72b6\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3002\u5f93\u6765\u578b\u3088\u308a\u5c0f\u578b\u3060\u304c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306f\u52a3\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u767a\u60f3\u306e\u30d8\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30d8\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\uff01\u30d8\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u30d8\u30ea\u30ab\u30eb\u3068\u5f93\u6765\u578b\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u5206\u6790"]}

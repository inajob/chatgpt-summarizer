They provide a cheap an easy to make way to create thumb-tightenable nuts for your projects.\nStarting with a PVC sheet, a series of discs can be cut from it with a hole saw. The hole in the centre of the disc is chosen such that its a bit smaller than the required nut, so that it can be pressed into the space with a bolt and a washer. Then a second PVC disc is glued over one side of the first before being sanded to a regular shape, resulting in a captive nut at the centre of a finger-sized and easily turnable handle.\nWe like this project, and we think that quite a few of you will too. We wonder how much torque it will take, but were guessing that a threaded insert could easily be substituted for the nut in more demanding applications. And of course, for more demanding applications you could always try knurling.", "title": "PVC\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "PVC\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5207\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u30cd\u30b8\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u624b\u9803\u3067\u56de\u8ee2\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u624b\u5143\u30cd\u30b8\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u5fdc\u7528\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u306e\u8010\u6027\u306f\u691c\u8a3c\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["PVC\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "[mikeandmertle]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aDIY\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306ePVC\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5fdc\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u624b\u8efd\u306aDIY\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8", "DIY\u30b5\u30e0\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

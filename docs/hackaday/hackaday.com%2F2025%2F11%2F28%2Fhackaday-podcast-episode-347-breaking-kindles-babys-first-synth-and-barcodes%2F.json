Will you fare better and perhaps win a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt? Mayhap you will.\nAfter that, its on to the hacks and such, beginning with an interesting tack to take with a flat-Earther that involves two gyroscopes.\u00a0 And we take a look at the design requirements when it comes to building synths for three-year-olds.\nThen we discuss several awesome hacks such as a vehicle retrofit to add physical heated seat controls, an assistive radio that speaks the frequencies, and an acoustic radiometer build. Finally, we look at the joys of hacking an old Kindle, and get a handle on disappearing door handles.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 347 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nNo news is good news!

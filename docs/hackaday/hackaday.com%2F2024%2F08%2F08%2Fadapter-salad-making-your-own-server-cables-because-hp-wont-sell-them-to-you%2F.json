If youre in the same boat as [Neel Chauhan], you might have found that HPE is less than interested in interacting with small individual customers. Thus, when a cable was needed, [Neel] was out of luck. The simple solution was to assemble a substitute one instead!\n[Neel] had a HPE ProLiant ML110 Gen11 server, which was to be used as network-attached storage (NAS). Unfortunately, it was bought as an open box, and lacked an appropriate serial-attached SCSI (SAS) cable. Sadly, HPE support was of no assistance in sourcing one.\nSlimSAS LP x8 to dual MiniSAS x4 cables arent easy to find from anyone else, it turns out. Thus, [Neel] turned to Amazon for help sourcing a combination of parts to make this work. A SlimSAS LP 8X to 2x MiniSAS SFF-8643 cable was used, along with a pair of Mini SAS SFF-8087 to SAS HD SFF-8643 female adapters. From there, SFF-8087 cables could be used to hook up to the actual SAS devices required. The total cost? $102.15.\nThe stack of cables and adapters looks a bit silly, but it works\u2014and it got [Neel]s NAS up and running. Its frustrating when you have to go to such lengths, but its not the first time weve seen hackers have to recreate obscure cables or connectors from scratch! Whats the craziest adapter salad youve ever made?"}

In the decades long race to build bigger CPUs, its been mostly forgotten. Forgotten that is, until [Klaus Scheffler] supersized it over ten-fold!\nThe project took about 2 years to complete and re-creates it faithfully  all 2,300 transistors included  enough to run software written for the Intel 4004. But the idea for this project isnt unique and dates all the way back to 2000, so what gives? Turning a bunch of masks for silicon fabrication into a schematic is actually harder than it seems! [Tim McNerney] originally came up with the idea to make a giant 4004 for its 35th anniversary. [Tim] managed to convince Intel to give him schematics and other drawings and would in return make an exhibit for Intels museum. With the schematic straight from [Frederico Faggin], software analysis tools from [Lajos Kintli] and [Klaus Scheffler] to actually build the thing, they did what [Frederico] did in one year without CAD, but in two with modern tools.\nThe full story by [Tim] is a lot longer and its definitely worth a read."}

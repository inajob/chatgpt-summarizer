As they say, the devil is in the details, wearing Prada. Apparently the devil also has an excellent manicure, because [Tamas Feher] has come up with a way to introduce incredibly detailed decals (down to 0.1 mm) in cheap, repeatable fashion, using a technique borrowed from the local nail salon.\u00a0\nThe end result can look quite a bit better than the test piece above.\nFor those who arent in to nail art (which, statistically speaking, is likely to be most of you) there is a common stamping technique for putting details onto human fingernails. Nail polish is first applied to voids on a stencil-like plate, then picked up by a smooth silicone stamper, which is then pressed against the nail, reproducing the image that was on the stencil. If thats clear as mud, theres a quick demo video embedded bellow. Theres a common industrial technique that works the same way, which is actually where [Tamas] got the idea. For nail salons and at-home use, there are a huge variety of these stencils commercially available for nail art, but that doesnt mean youre likely to find what you want for your projects front panel.\n[Tamas] points out that by using a resin printer to produce the stencil plate, any arbitrary text or symbol can be used. Your logo, labels, whatever. By printing flat to the build plate, you can take advantage of the full resolution of the resin printer  even an older 2 K model would more than suffice here, while higher res like the new 16 K models become the definition of overkill. The prints go quick, as they dont need any structural thickness: just enough to hold together coming off of the plate, plus enough extra to hold your designs at a 0.15 mm inset. That doesnt seem very thick, but remember that this only has to hold enough nail polish to be picked up by the stamper.\n[Tamas] cautions you have to work fast, as the thin layer of nail polish picked up by the stamper can dry in seconds. Youll want plenty of nail polish remover (or plain acetone) on hand to clean the stamper once youve finished, as well as your stencil. [Tamas] cautions youll want to clean it immediately if you ever want to use it again. Good to know.\nWhile this is going outside of the nail art kits comfort zone, it might not quite be abuse. It is however a very useful technique to add to our ever-growing quiver of how to make front panels. Besides, we dont specify you have to literally make components suffer; we just want to see what wild and wonderful substitutions and improvisations you all come up with.\n \n\n\n \n"}

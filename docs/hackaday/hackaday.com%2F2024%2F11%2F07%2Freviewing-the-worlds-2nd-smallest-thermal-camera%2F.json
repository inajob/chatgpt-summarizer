The package proudly states the device is the World 2nd Smallest Thermal Camera  when only the second best will do.\nThe camera is tiny and connects to a PC or directly to a tablet or phone via USB C. However, it did look easier to use on the end of a cable for probing things like a PC motherboard. The focus was fairly long, so you couldnt get extremely close to components with the camera. The zoom somewhat makes up for that, but of course, as you might expect, zooming in doesnt give you any additional resolution.\nHe also compares the output with that of a multimeter he uses that includes an IR camera (added to our holiday gift list). That multimeter/camera combo focuses quite closely, which is handy when picking out a specific component. It also has a macro lens, which can zoom up even more.\nWeve looked at  or, more accurately, through  IR cameras in the past. If you are on a tight budget and you have a 3D printer, you might try this method for thermal imaging, but it doesnt use the printer the way you probably think.\n\n"}

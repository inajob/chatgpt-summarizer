However, you dont have to stick to such pedestrian interfaces when making music. [Daisy] has a fun build that shows us how to put together a ribbon synth that makes wonderful little noises.\nNaturally, the heart of the build is a ribbon potentiometer (also known as soft pots). Its essentially a touch sensitive strip that changes in resistance depending on where you touch it. You can slide your finger up and down to vary the output continuously; in musical contexts, they can behave rather like a fretless instrument. [Daisy] employs one of these potentiometers in such a role by hooking it up to a Daisy Seed microcontroller board, which reads it with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The resistance values are used to vary the pitch of a dual-saw synthesizer programmed in the plugdata framework.\nWeve featured some other great ribbon synths over the years, too, like this tribute to the Eowave Persephone. Theyre not the ideal choice for those that prefer their notes on pitch, but theyre beautifully fun to play with when youre getting a little more experimental.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u97f3\u697d\u8868\u73fe\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "body": "\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u97f3\u697d\u8868\u73fe\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046", "- \u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "- Daisy Seed\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u697d\u5668\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u97f3\u7a0b\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

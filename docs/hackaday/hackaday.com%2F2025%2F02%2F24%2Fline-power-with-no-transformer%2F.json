[RCD66] noticed that an AC monitor meter must have some sort of power supply but had no transformers in sight. That led to an exploration of how those work and how you can use them, too. You can watch the work in the video below.\nSensibly, there is a transformer in the test setup  an isolation transformer to make it safe to probe the circuit. But theres no transformer providing voltage changes. Isolation is important even if you are taking apart something commercial that might be trasformerless.\nThe circuit is simple enough: it uses a capacitor, a resistor, and a pair of diodes (one of them a zener diode). He uses this basic circuit to drive simple regulators with input and output filter capacitors. Weve seen many variations on this design over the years.\nYou cant draw a lot of power through this arrangement. But sometimes it is all you need. However, this is pretty dangerous, as weve discussed before. Be sure you understand exactly what the risks are before you decide to build something like this.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u3057\u3067DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def", "body": "AC\u304b\u3089\u4f4eDC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3002\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u3057\u3067\u56de\u8def\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u3057\u3067DC\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u56de\u8def", "- \u96fb\u6e90\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u3057\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u4f4e\u96fb\u529b\u56de\u8def\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u7121\u3057\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u3079\u304d\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30ec\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

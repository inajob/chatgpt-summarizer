But, like most things, it gets more enjoyable when you involve a CNC. [Paul MH] went the whole hog with this build, creating a CNC string art builder that could handle the whole process, from placing the nails to running the string.\nIts an impressive build: you feed in an image, and the system calculates the location of the pins and the path that the string will need to follow. It then puts the nails into the board, pushes them in, and, with a custom attachment for the CNC, runs the string to create the art.\nOf course, the path to this was filled with prototypes, failures, and dead ends. [Paul] has laid these out pretty well in the video for the project, which he just released. In this, problems like detecting when the nails are picked up and placed are detailed, and the prototypes and Rube Goldberg solutions that [Paul] came up with are covered.\nLike all great projects, it is still a work in progress, but [Paul] has made some impressive progress, although he hasnt posted the code and models for his custom parts yet. Weve featured several string art builds, from polar platforms to fully formed commercial-grade builds that print your work for you.\n\n", "title": "DIY CNC\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d3\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "CNC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6587\u5b57\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u6a5f\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3001\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3068\u6587\u5b57\u5217\u306e\u7d4c\u8def\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3057\u3001\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u914d\u7f6e\u3057\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u5217\u3092\u8d70\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3002\u554f\u984c\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY CNC\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d3\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u753b\u50cf\u3092\u5165\u529b\u3057\u3066\u7cf8\u306e\u7d4c\u8def\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3059\u308bCNC\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3068\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\uff1aCNC\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d3\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u306eCNC\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30d3\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc", "\u3088\u308a\u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aCNC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

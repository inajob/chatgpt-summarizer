To that end, [Jonathan] whipped up a fun dice box, connecting it to the Internet of Things for additional functionality.\nExpect dice roll stat tracking to become a big thing in the DD community.\nThe build is based around Pixels Dice. Theyre a smart type of IoT dice that contains Bluetooth connectivity and internal LEDs. The dice are literally capable of detecting their own rolls and reporting them wirelessly. Thus, the dice connects to the dice box, and the dice box can literally log the rolls and even graph them over time.\nThe project was built in a nice octagonal box [Jonathan] picked up from a thrift store. It was fitted with a hidden battery and ESP32 to communicate with the dice and run the show. The box also contains integrated wireless chargers to recharge the dice as needed, and a screen for displaying status information.\nThe dice and dice box can do all kinds of neat things, like responding with mood lighting and animations to your rolls\u2014for better or worse. There are some fun modes you can play with\u2014you can even set the lights to sparkle if you pass a given skill check in your tabletop RPG of choice!\nIf you play a lot of tabletop games, and you love dice and statistics, this is a project well worth looking into. Imagine logging every roll so you can see how hot you are on a given night. Or, heck\u2014whether it was the dices fault you lost your favorite player character in that foreboding dungeon.\nWe see a few dice hacks now and then, but not nearly enough. This project has us questioning where smart dice have been all our life! Video after the break.\n\n"}

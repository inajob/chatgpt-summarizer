But what if one needs a curved\u00a0plastic mesh? Thats considerably harder to 3D print, but [Uncle Jessy]s figured out a simple approach: 3D print the mesh flat, then break out a mold and a heat gun.\nOf course, there are a few gotchas, but [Uncle Jessy] shares his tips for getting the most reliable results. The important part is to design and 3D print a mold that represents the final desired shape. Then print the mesh, and fit it into a frame. Heat things up with a heat gun, and press into the mold to deform the mesh while its still soft. Its much easier seen than explained, so take a few moments to check out the video, embedded below the page break.\nCustom eye inserts become a breeze.\nBecause the plastic in a mesh is so thin, [Uncle Jessy] says to keep the heat low and slow. The goal is to have the mesh stretch and deform, not melt.\nSpeaking of heat, when thermoforming, one usually needs to make the mold out of heat-resistant material. But the thermal mass of a mesh is so small that it really doesnt matter much  there just isnt enough heat trapped in the mesh to really damage a mold. As long as the mold is reasonably dense, theres no need to go overboard with making it heat resistant.\nThe whole process takes a little practice, but since the meshes are so fast to print and use so little plastic its easy to experiment a little.\nAs for the meshes themselves, a simple way to print a mesh is just to print a disc with no top or bottom layers, only infill. Set the infill pattern to honeycomb, for example, for an easy hexagon mesh. Weve seen a variant of this exposed infill idea used to create a desiccant container, and using it to print a mesh pattern easily is a neat trick, too.\nWhy might one need to reshape a mesh into a curve? Perhaps to custom-fit a costume piece, or make custom eye inserts for masks, as shown here. In any case, its a good technique to keep in the back of ones mind, and if you put it to good use, drop us a tip!\n\n", "title": "- \u66f2\u9762\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u5e73\u9762\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3092\u71b1\u3067\u66f2\u3052\u3066\u6210\u578b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "titles": ["- \u66f2\u9762\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u30d2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u6210\u5f62\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "- \u5b9f\u8df5\uff01\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a3D\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u5370\u5237\u3067\u30b3\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u71b1\u6210\u5f62\uff1a\u6750\u6599\u9078\u3073\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u89e3\u8aac"]}

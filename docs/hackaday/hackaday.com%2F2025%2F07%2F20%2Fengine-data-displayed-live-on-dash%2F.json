There are also lots of proprietary technologies that each automaker creates and uses for its own benefit. [Shehriyar Qureshi] has recently been diving into Suzukis Serial Data Line standard, and has created a digital dash using the data gained.\nThe project started with Python-based scanner code designed to decode Suzukis SDL protocol. Armed with the ability to read the protocol, [Shehriyar] wanted to be able to do so without having to haul a laptop around in the car. Thus, the project was ported to Rust, or oxidized if you will.\nMore after the break\n\n[Shehriyar] has installed the system in a Suzuki Baleno. The Raspberry Pi uses a VAG KKL interface to connect to the car via its OBD port and connect to the SDL line. It decodes this data, and processes it to pull out parameters like speed, RPM. It then drives an LCD display on the double-DIN stereo in the dash. A simple composite output allows the system to display live data while driving the vehicle. The UI uses the Ratatui library. The result is a display that both updates smoothly and rapidly. It has a great retro vibe that kind of reminds us of some interfaces seen in Hollywood movies. Despite being analog video, the results are pretty sharp.\nWeve seen a few great digital dashboards over the years.\n\nCrazy news: Ratatui made it into a car dashboard  suzui-rs \u2014 Suzuki Serial Data Line viewer in Rust Displays live car data, powered by Pi and shown on stereo over RCA Written in Rust  built with @ratatui.rs  GitHub: github.com/thatdevsherr#rustlang #ratatui #tui #car #suzuki\n Orhun Parmaks\u0131z (@orhun.dev) 2025-07-14T12:27:41.398Z\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Suzuki\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3067\u8eca\u4e21\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u306e\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8eca\u4e21\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8868\u793a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- Rust\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u8eca\u7528\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u306e\u8eca\u8f09\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Python\u304b\u3089Rust\u3078\u79fb\u884c\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc"]}

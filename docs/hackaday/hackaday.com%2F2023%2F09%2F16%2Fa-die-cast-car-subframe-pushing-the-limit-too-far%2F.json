All the ingredients beloved of the popular tech press are there, a crazy new manufacturing technology coupled with the Musk pixie dust. Its undeniably a very cool process involving a set of huge presses and advanced 3D-printing for the sand components of the mould, but is it really the breakthrough its depicted as? Or has the California company simply scored another PR hit?\nWe produced an overview of die casting earlier in the year, and the custom sand moulding in the Tesla process sounds to us a sort of half-way house between traditional die casting and more conventional foundry moulding. I dont doubt that the resulting large parts will be strong enough for the job as the Tesla engineers and metallurgists will have done their work to a high standard, but Im curious as to how this process will give them the edge over a more traditional car manufacturer building a monocoque from pressed steel. The Reuters article gushes about a faster development time which is no doubt true, but since the days of Henry Ford the automakers have continuously perfected the process of making mass-market cars as cheaply as possible. Will these cast assemblies be able to compete with pressed steel when applied to much lower-margin small cars? I have my doubts.\nAside from the excessive road noise of the Tesla we had a ride in over the summer, if I had a wish list for their engineers it would include giving their cars some longevity.\nHeader: Steve Jurvetson, CC BY 2.0.", "title": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u304c\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\uff01 \u8eca\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e88\u5b9a\uff01", "body": "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306f\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306b\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u88fd\u9020\u6280\u8853\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u91d1\u578b\u4f5c\u6210\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u8a08\u753b\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3068\u7af6\u4e89\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u306f\u7591\u554f\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u304c\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\uff01 \u8eca\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30b7\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e88\u5b9a\uff01", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u88fd\u9020\u6280\u8853\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u3000\u305d\u308c\u3068\u3082PR\u52b9\u679c\uff1f", "\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u92f3\u9020\u306e\u4e2d\u9593\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u304c\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u3067\u63a1\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\uff01", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u65b0\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u958b\u767a\u6642\u9593\u304c\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u77ed\u7e2e\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff01", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30e9\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u7d44\u7acb\u54c1\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u5c0f\u578b\u8eca\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u92fc\u677f\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f"]}

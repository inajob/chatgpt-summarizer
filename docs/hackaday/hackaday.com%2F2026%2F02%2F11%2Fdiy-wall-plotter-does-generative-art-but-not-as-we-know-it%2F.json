This project was partly born from [Teddy]s ideas about how to use aspects of machine learning in ways that were really never intended. What resulted is a wall-mounted pen plotter that offers a load of different generators  ways to create line art  that range from procedural patterns, to image uploads, to the titular machine learning shenanigans.\nThere are loads of different ways to represent images with lines, and this project helps explore them.\nWant to see the capabilities for yourself? Theres a publicly accessible version of the plotter interface that lets one play with the different generators. The public instance is not connected to a physical plotter, but one can still generate and preview plots, and download the resulting SVG file or G-code.\nMost of the generators do not involve machine learning, but the unusual generative angle is well-represented by two of them: dcode and GPenT.\ndcode is a diffusion model that, instead of converting a text prompt into an image, has been trained to convert text directly into G-code. Its very much a square peg in a round hole. Visually its perhaps not the most exciting, but as a concept its fascinating.\nThe titular GPenT works like this: give it a scrap of text inspiration (a seed, if you will), and that becomes a combination of other generators and parameters, machine-selected and stacked with one another to produce a final composition. The results are unique, to say the least.\nOnce the generators make something, the framed and wall-mounted plotter turns it into physical lines on paper. Watch the systems first plot happen in the video, embedded below under the page break.\nThis is a monster of a project representing a custom CNC pen plotter, a frame to hold it, and the whole software pipeline both for the CNC machine as well as generating what it plots. Of course, the journey involved a few false starts and dead ends, but theyre all pretty interesting. The plotters GitHub repository combined with [Teddy]s write up has all the details one may need.\nIts also one of those years-in-the-making projects that ultimately got finished and, we think, doing so led to a bit of a sigh of relief on [Teddy]s part. Most of us have unfinished projects, and if you have one thats being a bit of a drag, wed like to remind you that you dont necessarily have to finish-finish a project to get it off your plate. We have some solid advice on how to (productively) let go.\n\n", "title": "- \u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u58c1\u639b\u3051\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cGPenT\u300d\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "body": "Teddy Warner\u306eGPenT\u306f\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u58c1\u639b\u3051\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u5275\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u58c1\u639b\u3051\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u300cGPenT\u300d\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u591a\u69d8\u306a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "- \u8a00\u8449\u304b\u3089G-code\u3078\uff1adcode\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf\uff1aCNC\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u51e6\u6cd5\uff1a\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u559c\u3073\u3068\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u65b9"]}

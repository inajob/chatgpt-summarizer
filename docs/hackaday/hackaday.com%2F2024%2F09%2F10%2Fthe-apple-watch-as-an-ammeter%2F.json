Perhaps that view is needlessly pessimistic, because heres [JP3141] with an example that goes against the grain. Its an Apple Watch, being used as an ammeter. How it does that comes as the result of a delicious piece of lateral thinking.\nLike many mobile devices, the device comes with a magnetometer. This serves as an electronic compass, but its also as its name might suggest, an instrument for sensing magnetic fields in three axes. With a 3D printed bobbin that slides over the watch, and a few turns of wire, it can sense the magnetic field created by the current, and a measurement can be derived from it. The software on the watch is only a simple proof of concept as yet, but it applies some fairly understandable high-school physics to provide a useful if unexpected measure of current.\nWere surprised to see just how many times the Apple Watch has appeared on these pages, but scanning past projects it was a cosmetic one which caught our eye.

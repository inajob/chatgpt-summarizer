However, [The Q] has a taste for weirder creations that amuse perhaps more than they serve as viable transportation. His latest experiments revolve around tracked propulsion methods.\nThe build is a wheelless bike that relies on long thin tracks mounted to a mountain bike frame. The tracks carriers are fabricated using steel box section fitted with cogged rollers. The tracks themselves are made using a pair of bicycle chains joined with welded steel bars. Theyre fitted with slices of rubber cut out of traditional bike tires for grip. The rear track is driven from the bikes pedals, while the front is merely left to run freely.\nBy virtue of its wide, flat tracks, the bike actually stands up on its own. Its capable of riding in a straight line at slow speed, albeit relatively noisily. Steering is limited by virtue of the flat tracks, which dont operate well at an angle to the ground. Since the tracks only contact the ground at a point, too, the bike has very high ground pressure, which would make it likely to sink into anything less solid than asphalt.\nThe build is relatively similar to [The Q]s previous efforts to build a supposedly square-wheeled bike. What wed really love to see at this point is a tracked bicycle that actually made the best of the technology  by being both swift and capable of crossing soft, marshy terrain.

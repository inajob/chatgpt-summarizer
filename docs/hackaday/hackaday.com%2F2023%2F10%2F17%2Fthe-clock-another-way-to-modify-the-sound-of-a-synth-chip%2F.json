Its attracted the attention of [Folkert van Heusden], whos tried the novel experiment of seeing what happens when a sound chips clock is varied.\nA quick search of the internet reveals that the chip, which appeared in early Sound Blaster cards, is intended to have an 8 MHz clock. Hes hooked it up to an Arduino as a variable clock source, which surprised us but it seems an ATmega328s timer is faster than we expected.\nThere are a couple of WAV files, and as expected the clock frequency has a significant effect on the pitch. The samples just sweep up and down without much attempt at making a sound youd want to hear, but it does raise an interesting possibility of adding a further pitch bending ability to the capabilities already in the chip. When these circuits were new we couldnt control a clock on a whim with the 8-bit processors of the day, so of course none of us thought to try this at the time. Hes tried it, so you dont have to.\nThe SAA1099 has been mentioned in these pages only once, as a chip used in peripherals for 1980s Czech computers.", "title": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9SAA1099\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f \u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u6210\u529f", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u97f3\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e1\u3064\u3067\u3042\u308bPhilips SAA1099\u306f\u30013\u3064\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u5411\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u5909\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3068\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306f1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30b3\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9SAA1099\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f \u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u6210\u529f", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u53ef\u5909\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001SAA1099\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3001SAA1099\u306b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9SAA1099\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c1\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u53ef\u80fd", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30b3\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u305fSAA1099\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

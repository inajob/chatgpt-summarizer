Maybe it wont have to be if [Ten Tech] gets his way!\nIroning is the act of going over the top surface of your print again with the nozzle, re-melting it flat. Usually, this is limited to working on boring horizontal surfaces, but no more! This post-processing script from [Tenger Technologies], coupled with a heated, ball-shaped attachment, lets you iron the top of arbitrary surfaces.\nAt first, [Ten Tech] tried out non-planar ironing with a normal nozzle. Indeed, weve seen exactly this approach taken last year.\u00a0 But that approach fails at moderate angles because the edge on the nozzle digs in, and the surrounding hot-end parts drag.\n[Ten Tech]s special sauce is taking inspiration from the ball-end mill finishing step in subtractive CNC work: he affixed the round tip of a rivet on the end of a nozzle, and insulating that new tool turned it into an iron that could smooth arbitrary curvy top layers.\nOne post-processing script later, and the proof of concept is working. Check out the video below to see it in action. As it stands, this requires a toolhead swap and the calibration of a whole bunch of new parameters, but its a very promising new idea for the community to iterate on. We love the idea of a dedicated tool and post-processing smoother script working together in concert.\nWill 2025 be the year of non-planar 3DP? Weve seen not one but two superb multi-axis non-planar printer designs so far this year: one from [Joshua Bird] and the other from [Daniel] of [Fractal Robotics]. In both cases, they are not just new machines, but are also supported with novel open-source slicers to make them work. Now [Ten Tech]s ironer throws its hat in the ring. What will we see next?\nThanks to [Gustav Persson] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "- 2025\u5e74\u306f\u975e\u5e73\u97623D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5e74\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u975e\u5e73\u97623D\u5370\u5237\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30ce\u30ba\u30eb\u3067\u66f2\u9762\u3092\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u306b\u3057\u30012025\u5e74\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 2025\u5e74\u306f\u975e\u5e73\u97623D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5e74\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3\u6280\u8853\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u306b", "- \u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u578b\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u66f2\u9762\u3082\u52a0\u5de5\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "- \u975e\u5e73\u97623D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5207\u308a\u958b\u304f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u5171\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853"]}

Theres not a moment in the day free from the burden of tracking your blood glucose concentration, making Whats your number? a constant question. Technology can make that question easier to ask and answer, but for T1D patients, especially the kids who the disease so often impacts, all that tech can be a distraction.\nTo solve that problem for his son, [Andrew Childs] built this custom T1D smartwatch. An Apple Watch, which integrates easily into the Dexcom CGM ecosystem, seems an obvious solution, but as [Andrew] points out, strapping something like that on a nine-year-old boys wrist is a recipe for disaster. After toying with some prototypes and working out the considerable difficulties of getting a stable BLE connection  the device needs to connect to his sons iPhone to get CGM data  [Andrew] started work on the physical design.\nThe watch uses an ESP32-S3 on a custom PCB, as well as a 1.69 TFT IPS display and a LiPo battery. The board also has an accelerometer for activity monitoring and a vibrator for haptic feedback. Getting all that into a case was no mean feat, especially since some degree of water resistance and shockproofing would be needed for the watch to survive. [Andrew] had a case made by a local 3D printing company, and he managed to source custom-cut and silkscreened glass for the face. The result is remarkably professional-looking, especially for a software developer who hadnt really stretched his maker wings much before tackling this project.\n[Andrew] doesnt appear to have made build files available yet, although he does say he intends to open-source the project at some point. We look forward to that as itll be a big help to anyone trying to hack diabetes care. Until then, if you need a primer on continuous glucose monitoring, were happy to oblige.", "title": "- \u30bf\u30a4\u30d71\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u304c\u7279\u88fd\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bf\u30a4\u30d71\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u958b\u767a", "- \u5b50\u4f9b\u5411\u3051\u306e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9: \u7d71\u5408\u578bCGM\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- ESP32-S3\u3068TFT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306eGCM\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u6c34\u8010\u6027\u3068\u885d\u6483\u5438\u53ce\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064 DIY \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u8840\u7cd6\u5024\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

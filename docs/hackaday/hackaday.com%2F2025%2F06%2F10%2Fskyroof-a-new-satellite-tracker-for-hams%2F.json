Generally all thats needed is a five-watt handheld transceiver and a directional antenna. Like most things in the ham radio world, though, it takes a certain amount of skill which cant be easily purchased. Most hams using satellites like these will rely on some software to help track them, which is where this new program from [Alex Shovkoplyas] comes in.\nThe open source application is called SkyRoof and provides a number of layers of information about satellites aggregated into a single information feed. A waterfall diagram is central to the display, with not only the satellite communications shown on the plot but information about the satellites themselves. From there the user can choose between a number of other layers of information about the satellites including their current paths, future path prediction, and a few different ways of displaying all of this information. The software also interfaces with radios via CAT control, and can even automatically correct for the Doppler shift that is so often found in satellite radio communications.\nFor any ham actively engaged in satellite tracking or space-based repeater communications, this tool is certainly worth trying out. Unfortunately, its only available for Windows currently. For those not looking to operate under Microsofts thumb, projects such as DragonOS do a good job of collecting up the must-have Linux programs for hams and other radio enthusiasts.", "title": "- \u5b87\u5b99\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5fc5\u9808\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cSkyRoof\u300d", "body": "\u5b87\u5b99\u30cf\u30e0\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u306b\u306f\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300cSkyRoof\u300d\u304c\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b87\u5b99\u30cf\u30e0\u7121\u7dda\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5fc5\u9808\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cSkyRoof\u300d", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u901a\u4fe1\uff1a\u885b\u661f\u3068\u306e\u9023\u7d61\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u6a5f\u6750", "- \u885b\u661f\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30c9\u30c3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u30b7\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u88dc\u6b63\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- Windows\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea"]}

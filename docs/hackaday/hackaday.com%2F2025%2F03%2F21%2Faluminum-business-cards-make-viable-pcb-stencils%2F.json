Thankfully, a replacement material was not hard to find. It turns out you can use aluminum business card blanks to make viable PCB stencils.\nWhy business card blanks? Theyre cheap, for a start\u2014maybe 15 cents each in quantity. Theyre also the right thickness, at just 0.8 mm, and theyre flat, unlike rolled materials that can tend to flip up when youre trying to spread paste. Theyre only good for small PCBs, of course, but for many applications, theyll do just fine.\nTo cut these, youll probably want a laser cutter. [Mikey] was duly equipped in that regard already, which helped. Using a 20 watt fiber laser at a power of 80%, he was able to get nice accurate cuts for the stencils. Thanks to the small size of the PCBs in question, the stencils for three PCBs could be crammed on to a single card.\nIf youre not happy with your existing PCB stencil material, you might like to try these aluminium blanks on for size. Weve covered other stenciling topics before, too.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u540d\u523a\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "body": "Mikey Sklar\u306f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u7528PCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u88fd\u540d\u523a\u7528\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u9069\u5207\u306a\u539a\u3055\u3092\u6301\u3064\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u540d\u523a\u7528\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fPCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308bPCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u7d20\u6750", "- \u5c0f\u578bPCB\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6750\u6599\u9078\u3073", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6b63\u78ba\u306aPCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u306e\u5207\u308a\u65b9", "- PCB\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u7d20\u6750\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30af"]}

But for those who fancy experimenting with the format its still possible to make a basic card reader using LEDs and light sensors, as [Nino Ivanov] has done using an Arduino Uno as the brains. And these arent just for show, each of his cards holds a LISP program that runs in a cloud service.\nThe Uno does the job of reading, passing its data over its USB serial port to a tablet. On the tablet the serial data is piped to a cloud API to a LISP interpreter. It seems a needlessly complex way to run a factorial program and its certainly a little over the top, but on the other hand we love it as a glorious combination of the old and the new. With only 23 characters per card its quite an impressive feat to even fit a program on the format, perhaps writing code to fit on minimalist punched cards like this could become a programming challenge in its own right for a generation accustomed to mega-and gigabytes.\nIf you fancy a go yourself, this isnt the first punched card reader weve shown you.\n\n"}

There are a few areas of technology that dont have some concessions to EU rules in their manufacturing process, and if a common charging connector or right to repair werent enough, theyre back for another clash with the mobile phone industry. If you hanker for the days of replaceable mobile phone batteries, youre in luck because an EU Parliament vote has approved a set of rules covering batteries among which will be a requirement for replaceable cells in portable appliances.\nWe expect that the phone manufacturers will drag their feet just as some of them have over charger ports, but the greater ease of maintenance, as well as extra longevity for phones, can only be a good thing. There are a few other measures in the package, and one of them caught our eye, the introduction of a battery passport for larger industrial and EV batteries. Theres little more information in the press release, but we hope that it doesnt inhibit their exploitation by people in our community when introduced.\nWe look forward to seeing more replaceable battery models appear in due course, meanwhile, you can read some of our coverage of the EUs right-to-repair measures.\nHeader: Andy Melton, USA, CC BY-SA 2.0.", "title": "EU\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u306b\u306f\u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u9808\u306b", "body": "EU approves new rules for replaceable mobile phone batteries, which may result in improved phone longevity and ease of maintenance.

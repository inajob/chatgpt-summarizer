In the video after the break, [Veritasium] takes us on a fascinating journey through the development of Micromouse competition robots.\nThe goal of Micromouse is simple: Get to the destination square (center) of a maze in the shortest time. Competitors are not allowed to update the programming of their vehicles once the layout is revealed at the start of an event. Over the years, there have been several innovations that might seem obvious now but were groundbreaking at the time.\nThe most obvious first challenge is finding the mazes center. Simple wall following in the first event in 1977 has developed into variations of the flood fill algorithm. Initially, all robots stopped before turning a corner until someone realized that you could cut corners at 45\u00b0 and move diagonally if the robot is narrow enough. The shortest path is not always the fastest since cornering loses a lot of speed, so its sometimes possible to improve time by picking a slightly longer router with fewer corners.\nMore speed is only good if you can keep control, so many robots now incorporate fans to suck them down, increasing traction. This has led to speeds as high as 7 meters/second and cornering forces of up to 6 G. Even specks of dust can cause loss of control, so all competitors use tape to clean their wheels before a run. Many winning runs are now under 10 seconds, which require many design iterations to increase controllable speed and reduce weight.\nAll these innovations started as experiments, and the beauty of Microhouse lies in its accessibility. It doesnt require much of a budget to get started, and the technical barrier to entry is lower than ever. Weve looked at another Micromouse design before. Even if they arent micromice, we cant get enough of tiny robots.\n\n"}

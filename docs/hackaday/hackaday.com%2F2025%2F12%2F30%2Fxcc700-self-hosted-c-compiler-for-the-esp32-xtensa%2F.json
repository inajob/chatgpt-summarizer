Obviously this means that it should be capable of self-hosting its compiler, which is exactly what [Valentyn Danylchuk] did with the xcc700 C compiler project.\nTargeting the Xtensa Lx7 ISA of the ESP32-S3, this is a minimal C compiler that outputs relocatable ELF binaries. These binaries can subsequently be run with for example the ESP-IDF-based elf_loader component. Obviously, this is best done on an ESP32 platform that has PSRAM, unless your binary fits within the few hundred kB thats left after all the housekeeping and communication stacks are loaded.\nThe xcc700 compiler is currently very minimalistic, omitting more complex loop types as well as long and floating point types, for starters. Theres no optimization of the final code either, but considering that its 700 lines of code just for a PoC, there seems to be still plenty of room for improvement.", "title": "- ESP32-S3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cbPC\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "ESP32-S3\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u6700\u5c0fC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u300cxcc700\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32-S3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cbPC\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "- xcc700\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u3067ESP32-S3\u3092\u81ea\u30db\u30b9\u30c8", "- \u975e\u9280\u884c\u578bRAM\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305fESP32-S3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5b9f\u88c5", "- ESP-IDF\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fELF\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u306e\u5b9f\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

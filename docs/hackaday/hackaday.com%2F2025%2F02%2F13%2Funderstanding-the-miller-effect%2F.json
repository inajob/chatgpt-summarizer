For example, a relay seems like a simple component, but selecting the contact material optimally has a lot of nuance that people often forget. Another case of this is the Miller effect, explained in a recent video by the aptly named [Old Hack EE].\nPut simply, the Miller effect  found in 1919 by [John Milton Miller]  is the change in input impedance of an inverting amplifier due to the gains effect on the parasitic capacitance between the amplifiers input and output terminals. The parasitic capacitance acts like there is an additional capacitor in parallel with the parasitic capacitance that is equivalent to the parasitic capacitance multiplied by the gain. Since capacitors in parallel add, the equation for the Miller capacitance is C-AC where C is the parasitic capacitance, and A is the voltage gain (which is always negative, so you might prefer to think of this as C+|A|C.\n\nThe example uses tubes, but you get the same effect in any inverting amplification device, even if it is solid state or an op amp circuit. He does make some assumptions about capacitance due to things like tube sockets and wiring.\nThe effect can be very pronounced. For example, a chart in the video shows that if you had an amplifier with gain of -60 based around a tube, a 10 K input impedance could support 2.5 MHz, in theory.But in practice, the Miller effect will reduce the usable frequency to only 81.5 kHz!\nThe last part of the video explains why you needed compensation for old op amps, and modern op amps have compensation capacitors internally. It also shows cases where designs depend on the Miller effect and how the cascade amplifier architecture can negate the effect entirely.\nThis isnt our first look at Miller capacitance. If you look at whats inside a tube, it is a wonder there isnt more parasitic capacitance.\n"}

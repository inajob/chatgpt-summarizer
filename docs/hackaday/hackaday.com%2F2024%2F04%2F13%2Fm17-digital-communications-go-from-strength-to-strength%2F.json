In fact, amateur radio has often led the way in digital innovation.\u00a0 Theres a snag, though: many of the digital speech modes are proprietary. To address this along comes the M17 project, an effort to create an open digital communication protocol for radio amateurs. Weve looked at them more than once in the past few years, and as theyve come up with several pieces of new hardware its time for another peek.\nFirst up is the Remote Radio Unit, described as a comprehensive, UHF FM/M17 repeater in a box, optimally designed for close antenna placement, enhancing signal strength and reliability. The repeater forms the other half of the UHF handheld radio chain and will be crucial to the uptake of the protocol.\n\nThen theres OpenHT , their take on an SDR dual-band handheld radio for M17, and perhaps most interestingly for radio amateurs with existing radios, the Module 17 and its miniaturised Micro17 cousin, which are encoders and modems for any radio capable of handling 9600 baud serial communication.\nYou can read some of our previous M17 coverage here, and its very encouraging to see that this project is going places. If you want to see what theyve been up to lately, check out their YouTube channel which has some older tests including the one below.\n"}

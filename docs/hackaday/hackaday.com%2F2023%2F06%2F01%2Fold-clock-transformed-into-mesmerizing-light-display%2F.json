Fear not, though, for [ROBO HUB]s upcycled design turns a humble clock into a mesmerizing horological display of beauty.\nThe build starts by scavenging the movement out of a cheap plastic clock. A CD is then glued to the front of the movement to serve as a reflective backing plate. For numerals, the clock uses F3, F6, F9, and F12 keys nabbed from a keyboard.\nThe real party trick, though, is in the lighting. This build is elevated beyond hackneyed 90s desk clocks by the inclusion of a ring of LED strip lighting. When switched on, the LED light reflects and refracts on the surface of the CD, creating a mesmerizing shifting pattern featuring all the colors of the rainbow.\nCDs are actually quite magical from an optical perspective and have all kinds of nifty uses.\n\n"}

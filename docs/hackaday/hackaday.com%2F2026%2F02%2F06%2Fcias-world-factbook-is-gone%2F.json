Reference librarians could help you locate specialized data like the Thomas Register, the EE and IC Masters for electronics, or even an encyclopedia or CRC handbook. But if you wanted up-to-date info on any country of the world, youd often turn to the CIA. The originally classified document was what the CIA knew about every country in the world. Well, at least what theyd admit to knowing, anyway. But now, the Factbook is gone.\nThe publication started in 1962 as the classified The National Basic Intelligence Factbook, it went public in 1971 and became The World Factbook in the 1980s. While it is gone, you can rewind it, including a snapshot taken just before it went dark on Archive.org.\n\nBrowsing the archives, it looks like the last update was in September of 2025. It would be interesting to see a project like Wikipedia take the dataset, house it, and update it, although you can presume the CIA was better equipped. The data is public domain, after all.\nWant to know things about Croatia? Unfortunately, the archive seems to have missed some parts of some pages. However, there are other mirrors, including some that have snapshots of the data in one form or another. Of course, these are not always the absolute latest (the link has data from 2023). But we would guess the main languages (Croatian and Serbian) havent changed. You can also find the internet country suffix (.hr) and rankings (for example, in 2020, Croatia ranked 29th in the world for the number of broadband internet subscribers scaled for population and 75th in total broadband usage.\nWe are sorry to see such a useful reference go, but reference books are definitely an endangered species these days."}

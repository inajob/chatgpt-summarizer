[Mazen] was inspired by Ben Eaters 8-bit TTL Breadboard Computer but opted to solder the chips and other components onto proto boards instead of using solderless breadboards.\nThe 8-Bit computer is based on the Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture described in the book Digital Computer Electronics by [Paul Malvino] and [Jerald Brown]. These useful educational examples demonstrate data, computer logic, and even programming in the context of basic electronic components. Tinkering with such simple computers provides a real zeros and ones exposure to computation.\n[Mazen] added some additional features and functionality to his computer, including an instruction keypad, an address keypad, a dot matrix memory data viewer, a Schottky diode matrix ROM, and a boot loader that initializes the RAM with data stored in ROM. With clock speeds up to 100 Hz, the computer consumes around 300-500 mA of current.\nFuture plans include expanding the memory and instruction set from the present 128-bit (8\u00d716) RAM, 64-bit (8\u00d78) ROM, and a set of ten instructions.\u00a0 Already, this project is a great addition to an ever-growing catalog of homemade solderless breadboard computers, LCD snake games, and VGA video cards.\n\n\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

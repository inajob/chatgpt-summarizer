[Brian Haidet], the guy behind Alpha Phoenix, has managed to assemble movie footage of a laser beam crossing his garage, using a rig he put together for just a few hundred dollars. How, you ask? Well, for the long version, youre going to want to watch the video, also embedded below. But well give you the short version here.\nLight travels about a foot in a nanosecond. What have you got that measures signals on a nanosecond scale pretty reliably? Of course, its your oscilloscope. The rest of [Brian]s setup includes a laser that can pull off nanosecond pulses, a sensor with a nanosecond-ish rise time, and optics that collect the light over a very small field of view.\nHe then scans the effective pinhole across his garage, emitting a laser pulse and recording the brightness over time on the oscilloscope for each position. Repeating this many thousands of times and putting them all together relative to the beginning of each laser pulse results in a composite movie with the brightness at each location resolved accurately enough to watch the light beam fly. Or to watch different time-slices of thousands of beams fly, but as long as theyre all the same, theres no real difference.\nOf course, this isnt simple. The laser driver needs to push many amps to get a fast enough rise time, and the only sensor thats fast enough to not smear the signal is a photomultiplier tube. But persistence pays off, and the results are pretty incredible for something that you could actually do in your garage.\nPhotomultiplier tubes are pretty damn cool, and can not only detect very short light events, but also very weak ones, down to a single photon. Indeed, theyre cool enough that if you get yourself a few hundred thousand of them and put them in a dark place, youre on your way to a neutrino detector.\u00a0 \n"}

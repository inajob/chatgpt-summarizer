This means that Parkside hacking has become as much of a cottage industry as IKEA hacking, and theyre a firm favorite for modifications. [Gabriel-LG] has taken a Parkside robot mower, and converted it from a relatively mundane device to a fully-connected smart robot, with the aid of an ESP32.\nThe hardware is surprisingly simple, as all thats really needed is a stop/go command. This can be readily found by hooking up to the input from the mowers rain sensor, allowing the ESP to control its operation. Then theres an accelerometer to allow it to count motion, and a hookup tot he battery to measure voltage. The firmware uses ESPHome, resulting in a mower now connected to home automation.\nThis isnt the first time weve shown you someone upgrading the smarts on\u00a0 robot mover, and of course weve also taken a tour through the history of lawn mowers in general."}

Oh, and a scroll wheel. And a third button. Andnow youre realizing that mice can be pretty complicated. [DIY Yarik] proves that in spades with his impressive\u2014and complex\u2014mouse build. The only thing is, you might argue it isnt\u00a0really a mouse.\nThe inspiration for the mouse was simple. [Yarik] wanted something that was comfortable to use. He also wanted a mouse that wouldnt break so often\u2014apparently, hes had a lot of reliability issues with mice in recent years. Thus, he went with a custom 3D-printed design with a wrist rest at the base. This allows his hand to naturally rest in a position where he can access multiple buttons and a central thumbstick for pointing. In fact, theres a secondary scroll control and a rotary dial as well. Its a pretty juicy control surface.\nThe use of a thumbstick is controversial\u2014some might exclaim this is not a mouse! To them, I say, Fine, call it a pointing device. Its still cool, and it look like a comfortable way to interface with a computer.\nWeve seen some other neat custom mice over the years, too, like this hilarious force-feedback mouse. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5f62\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42", "body": "DIY\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3068\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5f62\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42", "- \u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30de\u30a6\u30b9", "- \u89aa\u6307\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306b\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

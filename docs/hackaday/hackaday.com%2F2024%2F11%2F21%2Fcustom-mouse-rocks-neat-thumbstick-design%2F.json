Oh, and a scroll wheel. And a third button. Andnow youre realizing that mice can be pretty complicated. [DIY Yarik] proves that in spades with his impressive\u2014and complex\u2014mouse build. The only thing is, you might argue it isnt\u00a0really a mouse.\nThe inspiration for the mouse was simple. [Yarik] wanted something that was comfortable to use. He also wanted a mouse that wouldnt break so often\u2014apparently, hes had a lot of reliability issues with mice in recent years. Thus, he went with a custom 3D-printed design with a wrist rest at the base. This allows his hand to naturally rest in a position where he can access multiple buttons and a central thumbstick for pointing. In fact, theres a secondary scroll control and a rotary dial as well. Its a pretty juicy control surface.\nThe use of a thumbstick is controversial\u2014some might exclaim this is not a mouse! To them, I say, Fine, call it a pointing device. Its still cool, and it look like a comfortable way to interface with a computer.\nWeve seen some other neat custom mice over the years, too, like this hilarious force-feedback mouse. Video after the break.\n\n"}

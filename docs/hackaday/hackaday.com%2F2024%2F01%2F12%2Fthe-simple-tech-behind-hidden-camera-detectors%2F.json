In the video after break [Big Clive], tears one down and gives us\u00a0 an in-depth look at how these gadgets actually work, and their limitations.\nMost detector follow the same basic design: a ring of LEDs through which the user inspects a room, looking for reflections indicating a potential hidden camera. Although this device can help spot a camera, its not entirely foolproof. The work best when youre close to the center of a cameras field of view, and some other objects, like large LEDs can produce similar reflections\nThe model examined in this video takes things one step further by adding a disc of dichroic glass. Coated with a metallization layer close to the wavelength of the LEDs, it effectively acts a bandpass filter, reducing reflections from other light sources. [Big Clive] also does his customary reverse-engineering of the circuit, which is just a simple flasher powered by USB-C.\n[Big Clive]s teardowns are always an educational experience, like weve seen in his videos on LED bulb circuits\u00a0and a fake CO2 sensor.\n\n"}

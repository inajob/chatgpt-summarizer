If you want a teeny one, though, you might like to build it yourself. [Maciej Nowak] has done just that.\nThe concept is simple enough; a small motor and a small blade make a small table saw. [Maciej] sourced a remarkably powerful 800-watt brushless motor for the build. From there, the project involved fabricating a suitable blade mount, belt drive, and frame for the tool. Some time was well-spent on the lathe producing the requisite components out of steel and aluminum, as well as a stout housing out of plywood. The motor was then fitted with a speed controller, with the slight inconvenience that its a hobby unit designed to run off DC batteries rather than a wall supply. Ultimately, though, this makes the saw nicely portable. All that was left to do was to fit the metal top plate, guides, and a suitably small 3 saw blade to complete the build.\nWeve seen mini machine tools like these before, too. They can actually be pretty useful if you find yourself regularly working on tiny little projects.

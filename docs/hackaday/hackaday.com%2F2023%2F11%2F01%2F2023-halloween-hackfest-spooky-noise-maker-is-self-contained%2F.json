This spooky Halloween noise maker from [C.M. Herron] is no exception. But while the projects weve seen lately rely on external computers and/or guitar pedals to create the effects part of the build, this one has everything running on a Raspberry Pi that sits inside the box.\nReaders of a certain vintage will recognize this as an 8-track storage box, on top of which are several noise-making objects that creak and ting and reverberate nicely. A USB microphone picks up the sounds, and by using a regular microphone instead of a piezo, [C.M.] can introduce varying levels of feedback to make the sounds even spookier.\nSo, how did [C.M.] make this work on a Pi 4? To put it simply, theyve got the Reaper DAW and Windows Valhalla plugins running on top of WINE, which running on top of Box64, which is running on top of the Bullseye Pi OS. [C.M.] sure learned a lot from this build, and hopes to inspire others to build their own spooky noise boxen. Plus, theyve already thought of ways to improve it for next year. Be sure to check it out in action after the break.\n\n\n \n\n"}

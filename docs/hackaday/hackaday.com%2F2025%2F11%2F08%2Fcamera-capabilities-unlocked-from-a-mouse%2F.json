Optical mice are a great example of this principle, using what are more or less entirely self-contained cameras just for moving the cursor across your screen. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out this camera made from an old optical mouse from [Dycus]!\nFor those unfamiliar with optical mice, the sensor used for tracking movement, like a camera, is just an array of photosensitive sensors. This allows a simple on-board microcontroller to convert the small changes from the visual sensor into acceleration/movement information to be sent to the computer.\nProving how capable these sensors can truly be, [Dycus]\u2019s camera manages a whole 3030 array of picture quality. Along with glorious greyscale, the pictures achieved from such a camera are more than recognizable. Putting together the camera didn\u2019t even require anything crazy beyond the sensor itself. What appears to be a Teensy LC board, basic buttons, and a small screen are essentially everything required to replicate the cameras functionality. Pictures, both standard and panoramic, can be viewed in a variety of color palettes stored on board. Along with a surprisingly impressive feature set, the idea is impressive.\nLimitations are often the mother of innovation, no matter if self-imposed or not, as seen here. However, [Dycus] still had a whole 3030 array to photograph. What about a single pixel? Let\u2019s make it even harder; we can\u2019t look directly at the subject! This is exactly what was done here in this impressive demonstration of clever engineering.\nThanks to JohnU and Thinkerer for the tip!", "title": "\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u9ad8\u753b\u8cea\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\uff1a\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528", "\u8ab0\u3082\u304c\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059", "\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u529b\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u305f3030\u753b\u7d20\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u9650\u754c\u304c\u751f\u3080\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u6311\u6226\u7684\u306a\u753b\u50cf\u64ae\u5f71"]}

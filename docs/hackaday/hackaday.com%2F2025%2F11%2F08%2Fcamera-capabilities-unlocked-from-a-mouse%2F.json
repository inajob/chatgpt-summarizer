Optical mice are a great example of this principle, using what are more or less entirely self-contained cameras just for moving the cursor across your screen. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out this camera made from an old optical mouse from [Dycus]!\nFor those unfamiliar with optical mice, the sensor used for tracking movement, like a camera, is just an array of photosensitive sensors. This allows a simple on-board microcontroller to convert the small changes from the visual sensor into acceleration/movement information to be sent to the computer.\nProving how capable these sensors can truly be, [Dycus]\u2019s camera manages a whole 3030 array of picture quality. Along with glorious greyscale, the pictures achieved from such a camera are more than recognizable. Putting together the camera didn\u2019t even require anything crazy beyond the sensor itself. What appears to be a Teensy LC board, basic buttons, and a small screen are essentially everything required to replicate the cameras functionality. Pictures, both standard and panoramic, can be viewed in a variety of color palettes stored on board. Along with a surprisingly impressive feature set, the idea is impressive.\nLimitations are often the mother of innovation, no matter if self-imposed or not, as seen here. However, [Dycus] still had a whole 3030 array to photograph. What about a single pixel? Let\u2019s make it even harder; we can\u2019t look directly at the subject! This is exactly what was done here in this impressive demonstration of clever engineering.\nThanks to JohnU and Thinkerer for the tip!"}

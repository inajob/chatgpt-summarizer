It makes sense were seeing new stacks pop up all the time, and todays stack is a cool one as far as code reusability goes. [Vitaly] over on Hackaday.io brings us pdsink  a C++ based PD stack with no platform dependencies, and fully-featured sink capabilities.\n\nThis stack can do SPR (5/9/15/20V) just like youd expect, but it also does PPS without breaking a sweat  perfect for your Lithium Ion battery charging or any other current-limited shenanigans. Whats more, it can do EPR (28V and up)  for all your high-power needs. For reference, the SPR/PPS/EPR combination is all you could need from a PD stack intended for fully taking advantage of any USB-PD chargers capabilities. The stack is currently tailored to the classic FUSB302, but [Vitaly] says it wouldnt be hard to add support for a PD PHY chip of your choice.\nIts nice to have a choice in how you want your PD interactions to go  weve covered a few stacks before, and each of them has strong and weak sides. Now, if you have the CPU bandwidth, you could go seriously low-tech and talk PD with just a few resistors, transistors, and GPIOs! Need to debug a particular USB-C edge case?

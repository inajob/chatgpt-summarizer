The top and front are constructed from an aluminium sheet bent to shape with a hand-bender. A laser-printed front panel finishes the aesthetic nicely, contrasting with the shiny aluminium. The electrode holders are part of off-the-shelf chemistry components, with the electrical contacts hand-made from components usually used for constructing stair handrails. Inside, a 500 RPM 12 V DC geared motor is mounted, driving a couple of small magnets. A PWM motor speed controller provides power. This allows a magnetic stirrer to be added for relevant applications. Power for the electrochemical cell is courtesy of a Zk-5KX buck-boost power supply with a range of 0  36 V at up to 5 A\u00a0 with both CV and CC modes. A third electrode holder is also provided as a reference electrode for voltammetry applications. A simple and effective build, we reckon!\nOver the years, weve seen a few electrochemical hacks, like this DIY\u00a0electroplating pen, a\u00a0DIY electrochemical machining rig, and finally, a little something about 3D printing metal\u00a0electrochemically.\n\n", "title": "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u6c4e\u7528\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u3000", "body": "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u6c4e\u7528\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u624b\u9806\u3002\u5408\u677f\u3001\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u3001\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001PWM\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3001\u96fb\u6e90\u306a\u3069\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u96fb\u6975\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u306f\u65e2\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u90e8\u54c1\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u69cb\u7bc9\u3002DIY\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u88fd\u4f5c\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u6c4e\u7528\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u3000", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u78c1\u6c17\u652a\u62cc\u5668\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e", "DIY\u96fb\u6c17\u3081\u3063\u304d\u30da\u30f3\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u52a0\u5de5\u6a5f\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

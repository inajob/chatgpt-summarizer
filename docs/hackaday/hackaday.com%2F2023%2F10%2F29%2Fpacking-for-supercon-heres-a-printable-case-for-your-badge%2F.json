This years Supercon badge is a gorgeous analog playground board we call Vectorscope, powered by an RP2040, MicroPython, and a ton of love for all of the creativity that weve seen you bunch express through the wonders of analog electronics. Theres a round LCD screen, SMD buttons galore, as well as some pokey through-hole headers, and if youve carried a badge around, you know that all of these can be a bit touchy! Youre in luck, though  just in time, [T.B. Trzepacz] brings us a 3D-printed shell.\nOver on Hackaday Discord, weve been watching this shell go through multiple iterations throughout the past few days  the initial design pics appeared almost as soon as we published the PCB files for the badge! Yesterday, [T.B. Trzepacz] dropped by the Design Lab where weve been putting finishing touches on the badges, and armed with the real-world PCBs, made the final tweaks to the design  then gave us the go-ahead to spread the word.\nThis shell is practical but elegant and does a mighty fine job protecting both the badge and the wearer. Nothing is hidden away, from the buttons to the expansion headers, and the lanyard holes keep it wearable. At this time, grab the Basic 2 files  these should work for SLA and FDM printers alike, and theyre tolerant enough even for FDM printers below average. Pick your favourite color scheme, or go for one of the transparent SLA resins, and when you arrive at the Supercon, youll have a case you can rely on.\nWant to give this case your own spin? Perhaps a Pip-Boy aesthetic or a Vectrex console vibe? Should you want to modify anything, the Fusion360 sources are right there, open-source as they ought to be. Its been a pleasure watching this case design grow, and in case youre looking to hire a skilled engineer in Berlin, [T.B. Trzepacz] is looking for work!"}

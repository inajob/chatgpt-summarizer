Google decided to pull the plug on the servers that operate these devices, turning them into  well  ordinary thermostats. Lucky for us [codykociemba] has been keeping up with various exploits for hacking the thermostat, and he started the NoLongerEvil-Thermostat\u00a0project.\nIf you want to smarten up your thermostat again, youll need a Linux computer or, with some extra work, a Mac. The thermostat has a DFU-enabled OMAP loader. To access it, you have to plug it into USB and then reboot it. There is a narrow window for the loader to grab it, so you have to be running the software before you reboot or youll miss it.\nYou can control your thermostat again!\nAfter that, the flash is relatively fast, but the Nest will look dead for a brief time. Then the No Longer Evil logo will show, and you are in business. We wish the hack simply replaced the Google software with a local website, but it doesnt. It redirects all the network traffic to a custom URL. Then you can control your thermostat from the nolongerevil.com website. So we dont know what will happen if they decide to stop hosting the remote server that powers this.\nThen again, dont look a gift horse in the mouth. If you get another year out of your trusty thermostat, thats a year you wouldnt have had otherwise. We do worry a bit about putting an odd device on your network. In theory, the project is open source, but all the important bits are in a binary U-Boot image file, so it would take some work to validate it. To get you started, the command to dump the content is probably: dumpimage -T kernel -p 0 -o kernel uImage. Or, you could watch it with Wireshark for a bit.\nWe were happy to get some more use out of our Nest.", "title": "\u53e4\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305fNest\u30b5\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u521d\u4ee3\u30fb\u4e8c\u4ee3\u76eeNest\u30b5\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u6a5f\u80fd\u505c\u6b62\u3057\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u518d\u7a3c\u50cd\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u63d0\u6848\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305fNest\u30b5\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "NoLongerEvil\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067Nest\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u5316", "Nest\u30b5\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "Linux\u3067Nest\u30b5\u30fc\u30e2\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6240\u5b58\u3067\u3082\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306aNest\u6539\u9020"]}

[Mia Mueller] is expanding our horizons with this clay stool she made for her garden.\nStarting with an out-of-budget inspiration piece, [Mueller] put her own spin on a ceramic stool that looks like a whimsical human head. An experienced potter, she shows us several neat techniques for working with larger pieces throughout the video. Her clay extruder certainly beats making coils by hand like we did in art class growing up! Leaving the coils wrapped in a tarp allows her to batch the process coils and leave them for several days without worrying about them drying out.\nDealing with the space constraints of her small kiln, her design is a departure from the small scale prototype, but seeing how she works through the problems is what really draws us to projects like this in the first place. If it was easy, it wouldnt be making, would it? The final result is a beautiful addition to her garden and should last a long time since it wont rot or rust.\nIf youre thinking of clay as a medium, we have some other projects you might enjoy like this computer mouse, 3D printing with clay, or a clay battery.\n\n", "title": "- \u9676\u5668\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u7528\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "body": "\u30df\u30a2\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u7c98\u571f\u306e\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u3001\u5ead\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u7acb\u3066\u308b\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9676\u5668\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u7528\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u9676\u82b8\u5bb6\u304c\u6559\u3048\u308b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u9676\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u96e3\u3057\u3055\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u7aaf\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3057\u305f\u9676\u5668\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u9676\u82b8\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u3092\u5f69\u308b\u4f5c\u54c1\u4f8b"]}

Its a clock that few hackers, if any, could read on sight\u2014just the way we like them around here!\nThe clock is called Hexa U.T.C, which might give you an idea why this one is a little tricky to parse. It displays the current Unix time in hexadecimal format. If youre unfamiliar, Unix time is represented as the number of non-leap seconds that have ticked by since 1 January 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC. Even if you can turn the long hex number into decimal in your head, youre still going to have to then convert the seconds into years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds before you can figure out the actual time.\nThe build relies on an ESP32-S2 module, paired with a 7-segment display module driven by the TM1638 I/O expander. The ESP32 syncs itself up with an NTP time server, and then spits out the relevant signals to display the current Unix time in hex on the 7-segment displays.\nIts a fun build that your programmer friends might actually figure out at a glance. As a bonus it makes an easy kicking-off point for explaining the Year 2038 problem. Weve featured other similar Unix clocks before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u30d8\u30ad\u30b5 U.T.C.: \u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a16\u9032\u6570\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Hexa U.T.C\u6642\u8a08\u306f\u3001Unix\u6642\u9593\u309216\u9032\u6570\u3067\u8868\u793a\u3057\u96e3\u89e3\u3002ESP32\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u30012038\u5e74\u554f\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u306b\u3082\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d8\u30ad\u30b5 U.T.C.: \u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a16\u9032\u6570\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 2038\u5e74\u554f\u984c\u3092\u5b66\u3076\uff01ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u8aad\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01Unix\u6642\u9593\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u6642\u8a08", "- TM1638\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f7\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u8868\u793a\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30fc\u5411\u3051\uff1aHexa U.T.C.\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8"]}

Weve seen hackers jump through all sorts of uncomfortable hoops to get Linux running on their mobile devices in the past. The fact that you can pick up a fairly powerful x86 handheld computer right now for a reasonable amount of money is certainly exciting. The Linux steam deck gets even more enticing when you consider the software support it enjoys thanks to its large and vibrant user community. No wonder weve started to see them dotting the workbenches during Hackaday Supercon.\nIf theres a downside, its that the Steam Deck was very clearly designed to be a handheld gaming system, not a portable computer. Sure you can plug in an external monitor and keyboard, but things can quickly become ungainly. This is why a printable dock from [a8ksh4] caught our eye.\nIts officially designed to let you mate the Steam Deck with the Corne keyboard, a split ergonomic design thats graced these pages a few times in the past. [A8ksh4] has included links for all the hardware youll need outside the printed parts, from the hinges and keyboard PCBs, all the way to the keycaps and stainless steel screws. If youre looking for a turnkey experience, this is it.\n\nBut as nice as the final results are, were equally excited to see what kind of variations on this basic layout the community can develop. [a8ksh4] designed it so that the Deck Clip which latches onto the handheld is completely separate from the keyboard itself.\nYou can bolt anything you want onto the other side of the hinges  so not only are totally different keyboard layouts on the menu but so are mounts that let you attach the Steam Deck to your desk or 3D printer. The design is available through OnShape, so you can do your modifications right in the browser should you feel so inclined.\nIts worth mentioning that this isnt the first time [a8ksh4] has used the Corne keyboard on a portable Linux machine  the \u00a0\u201cChonky Palmtop\u201d from last year combined the ergonomic keyboard and a Raspberry Pi 4 into a clever foldable form factor.", "title": "Linux Steam Deck\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Steam Deck\u306fLinux\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u652f\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001[a8ksh4]\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u304cSteam Deck\u3092Corne\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u5909\u5316\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["Linux Steam Deck\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u5370\u5237\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "Steam Deck\u3068\u5206\u5272\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u624b\u9806", "\u53ef\u5909\u6027\u306e\u9ad8\u3044Steam Deck\u306e\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306bCorne\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u65b9\u6cd5", "Steam Deck\u3068Corne\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1"]}

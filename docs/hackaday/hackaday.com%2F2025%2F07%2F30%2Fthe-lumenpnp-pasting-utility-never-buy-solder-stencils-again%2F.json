And he is quick to admit that his printed solder paste isnt presently quite as precise as solder stencils, but he is reporting good success with his technique so far.\n[Stephen] found that he could print PCBs with his fiber laser, populate his boards with his LumenPnP, and reflow with his oven, but what about paste? [Stephen] tried making stencils, and in his words: it sucked! So he asked himself: what if he didnt need a stencil? He built a Gerber processing, G-code generating, machine-vision implemented website. The LumenPnP Pasting Utility: https://paste.opulo.io/\n\nThe WebAssembly running in the Chrome tab itself connects to the LumenPnP and performs the entire pasting job automatically, with machine-vision fiducial calibration. Automatic alignment with fiducials was critical to the projects feasibility, and he achieved it using machine-vision from the OpenCV library.\nIn the video heshows us how to jog the camera to the home fiducial, load the Gerber files, and initialize the job. Hes implemented camera jogging by clicking on the image from the camera to indicate the desired target location, which looks like a very handy feature to have!\nSome initial setup just needs to be done once at the beginning to setup your board, additional board prints can then self-calibrate from the fiducials. The Z-index for the dispenser needs to be calibrated, and other job settings include nozzle offset calibration, dispense degrees, retraction degrees, and dwell milliseconds.\nIf youre interested in other options for solder stencils be sure to read Solder Stencil Done Three Ways.\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5\uff1a\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "YouTube\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u3001\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5857\u5e03\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u884c\u3048\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5\uff1a\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u4e0d\u8981\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30fb\u30db\u30fc\u30ba\u306eLumenPnP\u6280\u8853\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4f8b", "- \u6a5f\u68b0\u8996\u899a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- Gerber\u51e6\u7406\u3068G-code\u751f\u6210\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea", "- \u76f4\u611f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u81ea\u52d5\u8abf\u6574\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

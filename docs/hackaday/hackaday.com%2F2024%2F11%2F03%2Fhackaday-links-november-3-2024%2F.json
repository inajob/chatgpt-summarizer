Perhaps not anymore, if this Ig Nobel-worthy analysis of the infinite monkey theorem is to be believed. For the uninitiated, the idea is that if you had an infinite number of monkeys randomly typing on an infinite number of keyboards, eventually the complete works of Shakespeare or some other famous writer would appear. Its always been meant to be taken figuratively as a demonstration of the power of time and randomness, but some people just cant leave well enough alone. The research, which we hope was undertaken with tongue firmly planted in cheek, reveals that it would take longer than the amount of time left before the heat death of the universe for either a single monkey or even all 200,000 chimpanzees in the world today to type the 884,647 words of Shakespeares complete works in the proper order.\n\nWe feel like they missed the point completely, since this is supposed to be about an infinite number of monkeys. But if they insist on sticking with real-world force monkey labor, what would really be interesting is an economic analysis of project. How much space would 200,000 chimps need? What would the energy requirements be in terms of food in and waste out? What about electricity so the monkeys can see what theyre doing? If were using typewriters, how much paper do we need, and how much land will be deforested for it? Seems like youll need replacement chimps as they age out, so how do you make sure the chimps mix and mingle, so to speak? And how do you account for maternity and presumably paternity leave? Also, whos checking the output? Seems like wed have to employ humans to do this, so what are the economic factors associated with that? Inquiring minds want to know.\nSpeaking of ridiculous calculations, when your company racks up a fine that only makes sense in exponential notation, you know weve reached new levels of stupidity. But here we are, as a Russian court has imposed a two-undecillion rouble fine on Google for blocking access to Russian state media channels. Thats 21036 roubles, or about 21033 US dollars at current exchange rates. If youre British and think a billion is a million million, then undecillion means something different entirely, but we dont have the energy to work that out right now. Regardless, its a lot, and given that the total GPD of the entire planet was estimated to be about 1001012 dollars in 2022, Google better get busy raising the money. Wed prefer they dont do it the totally-not-evil way they usually do, so it might be best to seek alternate methods. Maybe a bake sale?\nA couple of weeks back we sang the praises of SpaceX after they managed to absolutely nail the landing of the Starship Heavy booster after its fifth test flight by managing to pluck it from the air while it floated back to the launch pad. But the amazing engineering success was very close to disaster according to Elon Musk himself, who discussed the details online. Apparently SpaceX engineers shared with him that they were scared about the spin gas abort configuration on Heavy prior to launch, and that they were one second away from aborting the chopsticks landing in favor of crashing the booster into the ground in front of the launch pad. They also expressed fears about spot welds on a chine on the booster, which actually did rip off during descent and could have fouled on the tower during the catch. But success is a hell of a deodorant, as they say, and its hard to argue with how good the landing looked despite the risks.\nWe saw a couple of interesting stories on humanoid robots this week, including one about a robot with a human-like gait. The bot is from Chinas EnginAI Robotics and while its gait looks pretty good, theres still a significant uncanny valley thing going on there, at least for us. And really, whats the point? Especially when you look at something like this new Atlas demo, which really leans into its inhuman gait to get work done efficiently. You be the judge.\n\nAnd finally, weve always been amazed by Liberty ships, the class of rapidly produced cargo ships produced by the United States to support the British war effort during WWII. Simple in design though they were, the fact that US shipbuilders were able to ramp up production of these vessels to the point where they were building a ship every eight hours has always been fascinating to us. But its often true that speed kills, and this video shows the fatal flaw in Liberty ship design that led to the loss of some of the early ships in the class. The short video details the all-welded construction of the ships, a significant advancement at the time but which wasnt the cause of the hull cracks that led to the loss of some ships. We wont spoil the story, though.

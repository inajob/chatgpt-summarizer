In the 90s these could connect you to AOL and Napster well enough, but in the early 80s the speeds were barely enough to read text as it loaded. A company called Hayes set out to change this with some of the first useful, widely-available modems for the PCs at the time. While they couldnt keep up with the changing times theres still a retro community that has these antiques, and to modernize it a bit this drop-in replacement for the PCBs replicates these old modems almost exactly.\nThe new PCB is equipped with everything needed to get a retro computer online again, including all the ports to connect a computer without any further modifications. It houses a few modern upgrades beyond its on-board processors, though. Rather than needing an actual acoustic coupled phone, this one has an ESP32 which gives it wireless capability. But the replacement PCB maintains the look and feel of the original hardware by replicating the red status LEDs at the front, fitting into the original Hayes cases with no modifications needed at all, and even includes a small speaker through which it can replicate the various tones, handshakes, and other audio cues that those of us nostalgic for this new online era remember quite well.\nFor those looking for a retro feel without the hassle of getting antique networking equipment functional again, this type of upgrade that preserves the essence of the original hardware is an excellent way of keeping retro computers functional on modern networking equipment. But if you absolutely must get the networking equipment exactly right down to the last patch cable, you might end up having to build your own ISP from scratch.\n\n", "title": "Hayes PCB: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u3001\u56de\u7dda\u306f\u96fb\u8a71\u56de\u7dda\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3067\u63a5\u7d9a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Hayes\u793e\u306f\u5f53\u6642\u306e\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u6709\u7528\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044PCB\u306f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u5916\u89b3\u3084\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4fdd\u3061\u3064\u3064\u3001\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Hayes PCB: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316", "\u30a8\u30c3\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u4fdd\u3064: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b", "Hayes\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9: \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u642d\u8f09", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u5316\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044PCB", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

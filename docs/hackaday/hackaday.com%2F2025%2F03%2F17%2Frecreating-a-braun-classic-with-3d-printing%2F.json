Many of the companys finest works have been forgotten outside of coffee table books and vintage shops. [Distracted by Design] wanted to bring one of the classics back to life\u2014the Braun HL70 desk fan.\nThe original was quite a neat little device. It made the most of simple round shapes and was able to direct a small but refreshing stream of air across ones desk on a warm day. In reality, it was probably bought as much for its sleek aesthetics as for its actual cooling ability.\nObviously, you cant just buy one anymore, so [Distracted by Design] turned to 3D printing to make their own. The core of the build was a mains-powered motor yanked out of a relatively conventional desk fan. However, it was assembled into a far more attractive enclosure that was inspired by the Braun HL70, rather than being a direct copy. We get a look at both the design process and the final assembly, and the results are quite nice. It feels like a 2025 take on the original in a very positive sense.\nFiles are available on Printables for the curious. Its not the first time weve contemplated fancy fans and their designs. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3HL70\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u3001HL70\u6247\u98a8\u6a5f\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3HL70\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u3067\u9b45\u4e86\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u306e\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "- \u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u51b7\u98a8\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3HL70\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3HL70\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

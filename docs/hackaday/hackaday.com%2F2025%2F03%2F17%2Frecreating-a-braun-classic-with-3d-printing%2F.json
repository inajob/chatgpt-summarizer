Many of the companys finest works have been forgotten outside of coffee table books and vintage shops. [Distracted by Design] wanted to bring one of the classics back to life\u2014the Braun HL70 desk fan.\nThe original was quite a neat little device. It made the most of simple round shapes and was able to direct a small but refreshing stream of air across ones desk on a warm day. In reality, it was probably bought as much for its sleek aesthetics as for its actual cooling ability.\nObviously, you cant just buy one anymore, so [Distracted by Design] turned to 3D printing to make their own. The core of the build was a mains-powered motor yanked out of a relatively conventional desk fan. However, it was assembled into a far more attractive enclosure that was inspired by the Braun HL70, rather than being a direct copy. We get a look at both the design process and the final assembly, and the results are quite nice. It feels like a 2025 take on the original in a very positive sense.\nFiles are available on Printables for the curious. Its not the first time weve contemplated fancy fans and their designs. Video after the break.\n\n"}

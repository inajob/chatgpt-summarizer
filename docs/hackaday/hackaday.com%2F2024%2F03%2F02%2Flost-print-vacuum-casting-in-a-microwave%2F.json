[Denny] from Shake the Future has just provided an update on his microwave casting process.\nSticking metal in a microwave certainly seems like it would be a bad idea at first, but with the right equipment it can work quite nicely to develop a compact foundry. [Denny] walks us through the process start to finish in this video, including how to build the kilns, what materials to use, and how he made several different investment castings using the process. The video might be worth watching just for all the 3D printed tools hes built to aid in the process  its a great example of useful 3D prints to accompany your fleet of little plastic boats.\nA lot of the magic happens with a one minute on and six minutes off cycle set by a simple plug timer. This allows a more gradual ramp to burn out the PLA or resin than running the microwave at full blast which can cause some issues with the kiln, although nothing catastrophic as demonstrated. Vacuum is applied to the mold with a silicone sleeve cut from a swimming cap while pouring the molten metal into the mold to draw the metal into the cavities and reduce imperfections.\nWe appreciate the shout out to respirators while casting or cutting the ceramic fiber mat. Given boric acids affects, [PDF] you might want to use safety equipment when handling it as well or just use water as that seems like a valid option.\nIf you want to see where he started check out this earlier version of the microwave kiln and how he used it to make an aluminum pencil.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ad\u30eb\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u92f3\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u5584", "body": "DIY\u5931\u6557\u4f5c\u306e\u8a71\u3002\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u52a0\u71b1\u3057\u3066\u92f3\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u904e\u7a0b\u3084\u6750\u6599\u3001\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4f5c\u696d\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u9762\u3084\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ad\u30eb\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91d1\u5c5e\u92f3\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u5584", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u92f3\u9020\u6240\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u6cd5", "\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ad\u30eb\u30f3\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u92f3\u9020\u6642\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56\u3068\u88c5\u5099", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u88fd\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u3092\u901a\u3058\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316"]}

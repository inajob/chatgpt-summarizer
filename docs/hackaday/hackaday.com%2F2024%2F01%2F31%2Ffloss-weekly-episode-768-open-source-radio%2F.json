The story starts with the Netmix startup, one of the first places doing Internet music in the 1990s. That business did well enough to get bought out just before the Dot Com bubble burst in 2000. Today, Tony runs the Radio Station plugin, which is all about putting a stations show schedule on a WordPress site.\nIn the process, the trio covers Internet radio history, the licensing complications around radio and streaming, the state of local radio, and more. Is there a long term future for radio? Does Creative Commons solve the licensing mess? Is AI going to start eating radio, too? All this and more!\n\n wordpress.org/plugins/radio-station\n radiostation.pro\n netmix.com\n tonyzeoli.com\n avlhms.com\n linkedin.com/in/tonyzeoli\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord?

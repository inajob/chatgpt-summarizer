This long history is the topic of\u00a0[Dr. Jon Peddie]s article series called\u00a0The Graphics Chip Chronicles. In the first of eight volumes, the early days of the NEC \u00b5PD7220 and the burgeoning IBM PC.\nTexas Instruments TMS34020 (Source: Wikimedia)\nThese are just brief overviews of these particular chips, of course, with a lot more detail to be found when you go digging. Details such as the NEC \u00b5PD7220 being the graphics chip in Japans PC-9800 series of computers which are famous for the amazingly creative art and games that this chip enabled.\nWhile the average Hackaday reader is likely familiar with the IBM PC side of things, Texas Instruments graphics controllers, including the very interesting TMS34010 and successor TMS34020 which can be called the first proper graphical processing units, or GPUs, effectively a CPU with graphics-specific instructions.\nAlthough its tempting to see computer graphics as a direct line from the days of monochrome graphic controllers to what we have today in our PCs, there were a lot of companies and countless talented individuals involved, including companies who built clones that would go on to set new standards. If youre into reading through a few years worth of computer history articles by someone who has been in the industry for even longer, its definitely worth a read.\nThanks to [JohnS_AZ] for the tip.\n\nTop image: NEC \u00b5PD7220 by Drahtlos  Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0)"}

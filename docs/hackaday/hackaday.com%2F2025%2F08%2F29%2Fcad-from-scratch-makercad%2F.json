[Marcus Wu] did, and instead of griping, he wrote his own CAD software. Its called MakerCAD, its published under an MIT licence, and you can try it yourself.\nIts written in Go, and its superficially similar to OpenSCAD in that the interface is through code. The similarity is skin deep though, as it provides the user with constraint solving as described in the video below the break.\nAs it stands its by no means feature complete, but it is now at a point at which it can be evaluated. Simple models can be created and exported as STEP files, so it can be used as a real-world CAD tool.\nWhether it will flourish is down to the path it takes and how its community guides it. But were pleased to see any new open source projects in this space, which remains overly dominated by proprietary packages. If you try it, write up your experiences, wed love to see how this develops.\n\n"}

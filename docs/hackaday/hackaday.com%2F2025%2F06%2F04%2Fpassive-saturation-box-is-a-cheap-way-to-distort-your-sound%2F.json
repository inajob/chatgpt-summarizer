However, its possible to get some crunchiness in your audio signal without all that fuss, as [Simon Hutchinson] demonstrates with his $2 analog saturation box.\nThe effect is achieved quite simply by installing a pair of diodes in opposite orientations, connected from the signal path to ground. This configuration is also known as wiring diodes in anti-parallel. When the signal increases in amplitude beyond the diodes forward voltage, the diode conducts and the signals peak is clipped off, which creates a distorted tone. Since there are two diodes, one in each orientation, both the tops and bottoms of the AC audio signal are clipped in this manner.\nThe amount of clipping is highly dependent on the diodes chosen and the strength of the signal youre working with. Silicon diodes clip around 0.7 V, while germanium diodes clip at about 0.3 V, but that doesnt give you much flexibility. You can work with this to some degree, though. You can up the minimum clipping level by stacking more diodes in series in each direction, or you can put in a potentiometer to vary your signals level before it hits the diodes. Really, though, this hard voltage limit is why more commonly, we use active distortion or overdrive effects that have more options for gain and level and such.\n[Simon Hutchinson] does an able job of explaining the effect and demonstrates its use with some simple beats. As a passive device, its pretty one note\u2014theres no EQs to mess with the frequency response, and no ability to change anything else about the sound, either. Still, its interesting to hear the effect it does have on a signal, and you might just find this is all the distortion you need. If youd rather go into full-fat distortion though, weve covered that too.\n\n"}

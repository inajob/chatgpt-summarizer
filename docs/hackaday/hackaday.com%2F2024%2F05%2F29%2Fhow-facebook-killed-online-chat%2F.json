The technology was novel, and it was suddenly possible to socialize with a whole bunch of friends at a distance, all at once. No more calling your friends one by one, you could talk to them all at the same time!\nMany of us would spend hours on IRC, or pull all-nighters bantering on MSN Messenger or AIM. But then, something happened, and many of us found ourselves having shorter conversations online, if we were having any at all. Thinking back to my younger days, and comparing them with today, I think Ive figured out what it is thats changed.\n\nDeliberate Choices\nHaving the right nick, profile image, and personal message was a big part of looking cool on MSN Messenger. You needed something that would make you seem interesting, hip, and worth talking to. Song lyrics were common.

You had to make the decision to connect to it, and sit at your computer to use it.\nSimilarly, logging into an IRC room was a deliberate action. It was a sign that you were setting aside time to communicate. If you were in a chat room, you were by and large there to talk. On AIM or MSN Messenger, it was much the same deal. If you wanted to have a chat, youd leave your status on available. If you didnt wanna talk, youd set yourself to Busy or Away, or log off entirely.\nThis intentionality fostered meaningful interactions online. Back then, youd sign in and youd flick through your list of friends. If someones icon was glowing green, you knew they were probably up to talk. You might have a quick chat, or you could talk for hours. Indeed, logging on to a chatroom for an extended session was a pastime enjoyed by many.\nIf you were on Linux, or used multiple chat services, you might have experimented with multi-chat clients like Pidgin back in the day.

Conversations were more focused and meaningful because both parties had set aside time to engage. This intentionality led to richer, more engaging discussions because participants were fully present.\nFurthermore, the need to log in and out helped create a healthy boundary between life online and off. Users balanced their online interactions with other responsibilities and activities. There was a clear distinction between online and offline life, allowing for more complete engagement in both. When you logged off, that was it. There was no way for your online friends to get a message to you in real time, so your focus was fully on what was going on in front of you.\nCritical Shift\nTwas the endless march of technology that changed the meta. Broadband internet would keep our computers online round the clock. You could still log in and out of your chat apps, of course, and when you walked away from your computer, you were offline.\nBut technology didnt stop there. Facebook came along, and tacked on Messenger in turn. The app would live on the smartphones in our pockets, while mobile data connections meant a message from the Internet could come through at any time.\nIf your buddies were green, you could hit em up for a chat! Facebook kind of has us all defaulting to available at all times, though, and it throws everything off. Credit: Pidgin.IM\nFacebooks always-on messaging was right there, tied to a website many of us were already using on the regular. Suddenly, booting up another app like AIM or MSN seemed archaic when we could just chat in the browser. The addition of the app to smartphones put Messenger everywhere we went. For many, it even started to supplant SMS, in addition to making other online chat platforms obsolete.\nAlways-on messaging seemed convenient, but it came with a curse. Its fundamentally changed the dynamics of our online interactions, and not always for the better.\nPerpetual availability means that there is a constant pressure to respond. In the beginning, Facebook implemented busy and available status messages, but theyre not really a thing anymore. Now, when you go to message a friend, youre kind of left in to the dark as to what theyre doing and how theyre feeling. Maybe theyre chilling at home, and theyre down for a deep-and-meaningful conversation. Or maybe theyre working late at work, and they dont really want to be bothered right now. Back in the day, you could seamlessly infer their willingness to chat simply by noting whether they were logged in or not. Today, you cant really know without asking.\nThat has created a kind of silent pressure against having longer conversations on Facebook Messenger. Im often reluctant to start a big conversation with someone on the platform, because I dont know if theyre ready for it right now. Even when someone contacts me, I find myself trying to close out conversations quickly, even positive ones. Im inherently assuming that they probably just intended to send me a quick message, and that theyve got other things to do. The platform provides no explicit social signal that theyre happy to have a proper conversation. Instead, its almost implied that they might be messaging me while doing something else more important, because hey, Messengers on all the time. Nobody\u00a0sits down\u00a0to chat\u00a0on Facebook Messenger these days.\nDo any of these people want to chat? I cant tell, because theyre always online!\nIts also ruining the peace. If youve got Messenger installed, notifications pop up incessantly, disrupting focus and productivity. Conversations that might have once been deep and meaningful are now often fragmented and shallow because half the time, someones starting them when youre in the middle of something else. If you werent logged on or available, theyd wait until you were ready for a proper chat. But they cant know that on Facebook Messenger, so they just have to send a message and hope.\nIn a more romantic sense, Facebook Messenger has also killed some of the magic. The ease of starting a conversation at any moment diminishes the anticipation that once accompanied online interactions. Plenty of older Internet users (myself included) will remember the excitement when a new friend or crush popped up online. You could freely leap into a conversation because just by logging on, they were saying hey, wanna talk? It was the equivalent social signal of seeing them walk into your local pub and waving hello. Theyre here, and they want to socialize!\nIts true that we effectively had always-on messaging before Facebook brought it to a wider audience. You could text message your friends, and theyd get it right away. But this was fine, and in fact, it acted as a complement to online messaging. SMSs used to at least cost a little money, and it was generally time consuming to type them out on a limited phone keypad. They were fine if you needed to send a short message, and that was about it. Meanwhile, online messaging was better for longer, intentional conversations. You could still buzz people at an instant when you needed to, but SMS didnt get in the way of proper online chats like Facebook Messenger would.\nThe problem is, it seems like we cant really go back. As with so many technologies, we can try and blame the creators, but its not entirely fair. Messenger changed how we used online chat, but Facebook didnt force us to do anything. Many of us naturally flocked to the platform, abandoning others like AIM and MSN in short order .We found\u00a0 it more convenient in the short term, even if some of us have found it less satisfying in the long term.\nOnline platforms tend to figure out what we respond to on a base psychological level, and game that for every last drop of interaction and attention they can. They do this to sell ads and make money, and thats all that really matters at the end of the day. Facebooks one of the best at it. Its not just online chat, either. Forums went the same way, and it wont end there.\nUltimately, for a lot of us, our days of spending hours having great conversations online are behind us. Its hard to see what could ever get the broader population to engage again in that way. Instead, it seems that our society has moved on, for the worse or for the better.

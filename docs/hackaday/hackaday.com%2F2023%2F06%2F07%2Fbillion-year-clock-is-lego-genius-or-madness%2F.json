Obviously, it hasnt been tested for a billion years, and we wonder if ABS would last that long, but the video below is still worth watching.\nEven if you arent a LEGO fan, the demonstration of a pendulum clock and escapement is worth something and really shows the practical side of things. Of course, making a pendulum clock that keeps time isnt anything magic  people have been doing that for centuries. But then more and more elements join to keep track of more time.\nYou might wonder how the pendulum keeps going for a billion years. Well, honestly, it cant. But a solar panel charges a battery that rewinds the clock when the drive weight reaches the bottom. We imagine the solar cell and battery would be maintenance items if you expected the billion-year life cycle.\nSome will ask why, but we get it. If you must explain why you build everything you do with LEGO, you are doing it wrong. The clock even keeps track of the galaxys rotation which, apparently, completes every 230 million solar years.\nWed be impressed with this clock even if it werent made with LEGO. Sure, it isnt as posh as the fancy clock in Denmark. But it does work longer  at least, in theory  than most other LEGO clocks weve seen.\n\n\nThanks for the tip [Hari].", "title": "LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5341\u5104\u5e74\u52d5\u304f\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "\u30ec\u30b4\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u300210\u5104\u5e74\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\u592a\u967d\u96fb\u6c60\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3001\u96fb\u6c60\u304c\u5dfb\u304d\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\u3001\u632f\u308a\u5b50\u304c\u9577\u304f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u9280\u6cb3\u7cfb\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u306b\u3082\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["LEGO\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5341\u5104\u5e74\u52d5\u304f\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "LEGO\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u5b66\u307c\u3046\uff01\u632f\u308a\u5b50\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "\u592a\u967d\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u52d5\u304fLEGO\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u306f", "LEGO\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u7d0423,000\u4e07\u5e74\u304b\u3051\u3066\u9280\u6cb3\u7cfb\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u3092\u793a\u3059", "LEGO\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3001\u3082\u3063\u3068\u3082\u9577\u304f\u52d5\u304d\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\uff01"]}

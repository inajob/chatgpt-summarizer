But what is a tiny factory without tiny conveyor belts? Not a very productive one, thats for sure.\nAs you may have noticed, this is designed after the transporter belts from the game Factorio. [Hope This Works] ultimately wants something functional thats small enough to fit in one hand and has that transporter belt aesthetic going. He also saw this as a way to level up his CAD skills from approximately 1, and as youll see in the comprehensive video after the break, that definitely happened.\nAnd so [Hope This Works] started by designing the all-important sprockets. He found a little eight-toothed number on McMaster-Carr and used the drawing for reference. From there, he designed the rest of the parts around the sprockets, adding a base so that it can sit on the desk or be held in the hand.\nFor now, this proof-of-concept is hand-cranked. We especially love that [Hope This Works] included a square hole for the crank handle to stand in when not in use. Be sure to check out the design/build video after the break to see it in action.\nHow happy would you be to see Factorio come up in a job interview?\n\n\nThanks for the tip, [foamyguy]!"}

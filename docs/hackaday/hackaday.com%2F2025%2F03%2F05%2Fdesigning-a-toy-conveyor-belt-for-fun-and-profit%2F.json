But what is a tiny factory without tiny conveyor belts? Not a very productive one, thats for sure.\nAs you may have noticed, this is designed after the transporter belts from the game Factorio. [Hope This Works] ultimately wants something functional thats small enough to fit in one hand and has that transporter belt aesthetic going. He also saw this as a way to level up his CAD skills from approximately 1, and as youll see in the comprehensive video after the break, that definitely happened.\nAnd so [Hope This Works] started by designing the all-important sprockets. He found a little eight-toothed number on McMaster-Carr and used the drawing for reference. From there, he designed the rest of the parts around the sprockets, adding a base so that it can sit on the desk or be held in the hand.\nFor now, this proof-of-concept is hand-cranked. We especially love that [Hope This Works] included a square hole for the crank handle to stand in when not in use. Be sure to check out the design/build video after the break to see it in action.\nHow happy would you be to see Factorio come up in a job interview?\n\n\nThanks for the tip, [foamyguy]!", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578b\u5de5\u5834\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "[Hope This Works]\u306f\u3001\u30ac\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u5c0f\u578b\u5de5\u5834\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cFactorio\u300d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3092\u53c2\u8003\u306b\u3001\u624b\u3067\u6301\u3066\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578b\u5de5\u5834\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cFactorio\u300d\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- CAD\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u624b\u52d5\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u5f0f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u5f62\u306b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d9\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b"]}

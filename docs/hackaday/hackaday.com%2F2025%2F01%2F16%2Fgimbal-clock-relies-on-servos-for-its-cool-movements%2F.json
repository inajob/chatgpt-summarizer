Most were just variations on hands spinning in a circle, with the occasional tweeting bird mechanism to liven things up. These days, were treated to all kinds of original and oddball designs, like this neat gimbal clock from [TwistedTinned].\nThe concept of the build is straightforward enough. It has four main vertical arms, each with a servo at the base that rotates about a vertical axis. Upon each arm are between one and three servos which rotate 3D printed structures in the shape of numbers. A Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller commands the servos to the correct positions to display the current time. It also uses its WiFi connection to get accurate time updates directly from a network time server.\nIts quite an artistic build\u2014and its rather enjoyable to watch this one flex and twist its way into displaying the right time. Its also easier to read at a glance than some of the more unintelligible designs out there. Indeed, we see all kinds of neat and innovative clocks around these parts.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30b8\u30f3\u30d0\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30b8\u30f3\u30d0\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u6642\u9593\u8868\u793a\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u517c\u306d\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30b8\u30f3\u30d0\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u6642\u523b\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u6642\u8a08", "- WiFi\u3067\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u6642\u523b\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u6642\u8a08", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6570\u5b57\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u6642\u8a08\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u5358\u8abf\u3055\u3092\u6253\u7834\u3059\u308b\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

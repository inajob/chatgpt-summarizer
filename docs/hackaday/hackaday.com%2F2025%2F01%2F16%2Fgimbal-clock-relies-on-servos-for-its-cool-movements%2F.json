Most were just variations on hands spinning in a circle, with the occasional tweeting bird mechanism to liven things up. These days, were treated to all kinds of original and oddball designs, like this neat gimbal clock from [TwistedTinned].\nThe concept of the build is straightforward enough. It has four main vertical arms, each with a servo at the base that rotates about a vertical axis. Upon each arm are between one and three servos which rotate 3D printed structures in the shape of numbers. A Wemos D1 Mini microcontroller commands the servos to the correct positions to display the current time. It also uses its WiFi connection to get accurate time updates directly from a network time server.\nIts quite an artistic build\u2014and its rather enjoyable to watch this one flex and twist its way into displaying the right time. Its also easier to read at a glance than some of the more unintelligible designs out there. Indeed, we see all kinds of neat and innovative clocks around these parts.\n\n"}

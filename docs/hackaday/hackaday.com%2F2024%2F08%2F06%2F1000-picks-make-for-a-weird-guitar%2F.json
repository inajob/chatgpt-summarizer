We wonder what our forebears would think of this guitar strummed with 1000 picks?\n[Mattias Krantz] wondered what the best number of picks was to play guitar and took the experiment to its illogical extreme. Starting with zero picks and working up through various 3D printed multi-picks he tests all the feasible combinations of handheld picks.\nAfter that, he switches gears to a fishing rod-actuated system of several picks in a ring. Not pleased with the initial acoustics of the picks in this system, he switched to printing his picks in a more flexible filament to better approximate the characteristics of the human thumb. Finally, he takes us to the undiscovered country of a spinning ring of 1000 picks strumming the underside of the strings and the interesting acoustic result. As many pointed out in the comments, this blurs the line between a guitar and a hurdy gurdy.\nIf you want more melodic musical mischief, perhaps try this optical guitar pickup, a $30 guitar build, or get fancy with a 3D printed violin?\n\n", "title": "1000\u672c\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u594f\u3067\u308b\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u5f26\u697d\u5668\u306f\u6587\u660e\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u3066\u304d\u305f\u30021000\u672c\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u6f14\u594f\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u304b\u3089\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u697d\u5668\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["1000\u672c\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u594f\u3067\u308b\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u6f14\u594f\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6570\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u578b\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u6f14\u594f\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30d5\u30ec\u30ad\u30b7\u30d6\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u7279\u6027", "1000\u672c\u306e\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u594f\u3067\u308b\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u6f14\u594f"]}

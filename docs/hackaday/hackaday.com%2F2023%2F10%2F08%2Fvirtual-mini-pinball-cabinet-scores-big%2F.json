Yeah, us either, and thats why were so interested in [mircemk]s great-looking DIY mini virtual pinball cabinet. Since [mircemk] is a IT service specialist, they are lucky enough to have access to lots used and broken equipment, and thats what this build is made of.\nEssentially two computers working together, the playfield is a old 17-inch monitor that needed its LED lighting replaced before gracing the MDF cabinet The backglass is an ancient 10-inch tablet that was perfect for this application.\nEven the motherboard, RAM, and SSD came from one of [mircemk]s previous PCs. The SSD needed some attention first as well  it didnt work sometimes, and didnt show up in the BIOS at all, so [mircemk] threw it in the oven for 10 minutes at 250\u00b0, and now all is well.\nOne thing we really like about this build is that instead of designing a control board for the buttons, [mircemk] used a cheap USB joystick and wired them up to the pads.\nSo how does the tablet figure into all of this? Its connected to a PC via USB and does its job thanks to a piece of software called Wired XDisplay. There is even a tilt switch in this bad boy. Because whats a pinball cabinet without a tilt switch? A cheaters cabinet, thats what. Check out the build/demo video after the break.\nDont even have the space for a mini cabinet? We hear you. Heres one that fits in the palm of your hand.\n\n"}

Even if your original idea didnt call for a display, if youve got I2C and a couple bucks burning a hole in your pocket, why not add one? Surely youll figure out what to show on it as the project develops.\nBut thats where it can get a little tricky  in terms of hardware, adding a screen just takes running a few extra wires, but the software side is another story. Not only do you have to contend with the different display libraries, but just creating the image assets to display on the screen can be a hassle if its not something you do regularly. Enter Lopaka, a graphics and user interface editor for electronic projects created by [Mikhail Ilin].\nMore after the break\n\nUsing this web-based tool is pretty simple, you simply load it up, pick the display type youve got, and then start using the visual tools to do things like draw shapes and add text. As you work, a window on the bottom will start filling with the source code that youll ultimately copy and paste into your project to re-create what youre seeing.\nYou can import your own images and have them converted to arrays of data, though theres also a selection of icons that you can select from which might meet your needs. In fact, theres even a gallery of editable screens and user interfaces that have been created with Lopka if you dont want to start from scratch.\nIn playing around with the tool, the only annoyance we really noticed was the fact that the source code window isnt editable. That is, we occasionally tried to code to modify what we were seeing in the visual preview, but it doesnt work that way. We were somewhat concerned when we saw that the tool also features a paid Plus mode, but in truth, the features and capabilities available in the free mode (and what gets unlocked when you cough up the $5.95 a month) seem more than fair.\nIf Lopaka looks similar, it could be because its the evolution of a tool offered up specifically for the Flipper Zero that we covered back in 2022. [Mikhail] saw an opportunity to open the tool up to the wider maker and hardware hacker community by adding support for other display types and libraries, which we think was a brilliant move."}

Theres no longer a speedy developing service at you local mall though, so unless you dont mind waiting for one of the few remaining professional labs youll be doing it yourself. Black-and-white is relatively straightforward, but colour is another matter. [Jason Koebler] has set up his own colour processing lab, and takes us through the difficult and sometimes frustrating process.\nFrom an exhaustive list of everything required, to a description of the ups and downs of loading a Patterson tank and the vagiuaries of developer chemicals, we certainly recognise quite a bit of his efforts from the Hackaday black-and-white lab. But this is 2024 so theres a step from days past thats missing. We no longer print our photos, instead we scan the negatives and process then digitally, and its here that some of the good advice lies.\nWhat this piece shows us is that colour developing is certainly achievable even if the results in a home lab can be variable. If youre up for trying it, you can always automate some of the process.", "title": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u5199\u771f\u306e\u73fe\u50cf\uff1a\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5199\u771f\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u306f\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u306a\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u306f\u4eba\u6c17\u3002\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u73fe\u50cf\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u306a\u73fe\u50cf\u306f\u7d42\u4e86\u3002\u767d\u9ed2\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u30022024\u5e74\u3001\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3084\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u73fe\u50cf\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u5199\u771f\u306e\u73fe\u50cf\uff1a\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30afADAY\uff1aDIY\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u73fe\u50cf\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u73fe\u50cf\uff1a\u81ea\u5b85\u30e9\u30dc\u3067\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u5199\u771f\u3092\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6642\u4ee3", "DIY\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u5199\u771f\u73fe\u50cf\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u3078\u306e\u9053"]}

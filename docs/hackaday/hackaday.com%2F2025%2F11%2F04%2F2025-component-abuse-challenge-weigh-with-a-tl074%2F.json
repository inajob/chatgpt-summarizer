So when he remarks on something in his books, its worth taking notice. It was just such an observation that caught the eye of [Trashtronic]; that the pressure on a precision op-amp from curing resin could be enough to change the devices offset voltage. Could this property be used for something? The op-amp as a load cell was born!\nThe result is something of an op-amp torture device, resembling a small weighing machine with a couple of DIP-8 packages bearing the load. Surprisingly modest weights will change the offset voltage, though it was found that the value will drift over time.\nThis is clearly an experimental project and not a practical load cell, but it captures the essence of the 2025 Component Abuse Challenge of which it forms a part. Finding completely unexpected properties of components doesnt always have to lead to useful results, and were glad someone had done this one just to find out whether or not it works. You still just about have time for an entry yourself if you fancy giving it a go.\n \n\n\n"}

One such device is an old Belgacom TV Box. Instead of using the ubiquitous LCD screen, it uses a VFD display for its user interface, and [Jean] has taken control of it with the ESPTimeCastVFD project.\nInside this box is a mix of two different 7-segment displays, which he uses to show the time and date, and 12 VFD displays, which are used to show weather data. To get the display working, the box was taken apart, and there were a few different areas [Jean] had to tap into: power for the soon-to-be-embedded ESP32-WROOM-32, as well as tying into the SPI lines to control the VFD. [Jean] also needed a 3.3V to 5V level shifter, and for this he used a 74LS125N dating all the way back to 1978.\nThe ESPTimeCast project, which weve featured here before, handles a lot of the time display and weather forecast shown on the front panel. However, [Jean] did have to add support for the VFD display, as well as adding wind speed to the display\u2014as one of his uses for this is to judge the days suitability for flying RC planes. Once powered up, the ESP32 hosts a WiFi access point, allowing you to connect to it and set the configuration of the device, such as location, WiFi credentials, what displays you want to see, and many more. Thank you [Jean] for sending in your hack, saving this device from a landfill by turning it into a personalized display! Be sure to check out some of our other weather displays weve featured!\n\n"}

Thus was created a fancy levitating generator that turns a stream of air into electricity.\u00a0\nThe basic concept is simple enough for a generator\u2014magnets moving past coils to generate electricity. Of course, Lego doesnt offer high-strength magnetic components or copper coils, so this generator is a hybrid build which includes a lot of [Jamies] non-Lego parts. Ultimately though, this is fun because of the weird way its built. Lego Technic parts make a very crude turbine, but it does the job. The levitation is a particularly nice touch\u2014the build uses magnets to hover the rotor in mid-air to minimize friction to the point where it can free wheel for minutes once run up to speed. The source of power for this contraption is interesting, too. [Jamie] didnt just go with an air compressor or a simple homebrew soda bottle tank. Instead, he decided to use a couple of gas duster cans to do the job. The demos are pretty fun, with [Jamie] using lots of LEDs and a radio to demonstrate the output.\u00a0 The one thing wed like to see more of is proper current/voltage instrumentation\u2014and some measurement of the RPM of this thing!\nWhile few of us will be rushing out to build Lego generators, the video nonetheless has educational value from a mechanical engineering standpoint. Fluids and gases really do make wonderful bearings, as weve discussed before. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6d6e\u904a\u3059\u308b\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u6d6e\u904a\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30ac\u30b9\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3002\u9762\u767d\u3044\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u5b9f\u6f14\u304c\u5b66\u3073\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30b4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6d6e\u904a\u3059\u308b\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u78c1\u77f3\u3068\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30b4\u306e\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f", "- \u7a7a\u6c17\u3092\u96fb\u6c17\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30ec\u30b4\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u30c7\u30e2", "- \u30ec\u30b4\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u7c97\u88fd\u306e\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3", "- \u30ac\u30b9\u30c0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

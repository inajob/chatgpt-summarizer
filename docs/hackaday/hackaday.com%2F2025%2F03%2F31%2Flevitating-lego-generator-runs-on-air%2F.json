Thus was created a fancy levitating generator that turns a stream of air into electricity.\u00a0\nThe basic concept is simple enough for a generator\u2014magnets moving past coils to generate electricity. Of course, Lego doesnt offer high-strength magnetic components or copper coils, so this generator is a hybrid build which includes a lot of [Jamies] non-Lego parts. Ultimately though, this is fun because of the weird way its built. Lego Technic parts make a very crude turbine, but it does the job. The levitation is a particularly nice touch\u2014the build uses magnets to hover the rotor in mid-air to minimize friction to the point where it can free wheel for minutes once run up to speed. The source of power for this contraption is interesting, too. [Jamie] didnt just go with an air compressor or a simple homebrew soda bottle tank. Instead, he decided to use a couple of gas duster cans to do the job. The demos are pretty fun, with [Jamie] using lots of LEDs and a radio to demonstrate the output.\u00a0 The one thing wed like to see more of is proper current/voltage instrumentation\u2014and some measurement of the RPM of this thing!\nWhile few of us will be rushing out to build Lego generators, the video nonetheless has educational value from a mechanical engineering standpoint. Fluids and gases really do make wonderful bearings, as weve discussed before. Video after the break.\n\n"}

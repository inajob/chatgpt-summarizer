There are many contenders to the crown of first smartphone, but in that discussion its often forgotten that the first generally available such devices werent phones at all, but PDAs, or Personal Digital Assistants. The fancier ones blurred the line between PDA and laptop and were the forerunner devices to netbooks, and its one of these that [Remy] is putting through its paces. He makes the bold claim that it can do things the iPhone cant, and while the two devices are in no way comparable hes right on one point. His HP Journada 720 can host a development environment, while the iPhone cant.\nThe HP was something of a turn-of-the-millennium object of desire, being a palmtop computer with a half-decent keyboard a 640240 pixel TFT display, and 32 MB of RAM alongside its 206 MHz Intel StrongARM CPU. Its Windows CE OS wasnt quite the desktop Windows of the day, but it was close enough to be appealing for the 90s exec who had everything. Astoundingly it has more than one Linux distro that can run on it with some level of modernity, which is where hes able to make the claim about the iPhone being inferior.\nWe remember the Journada clamshell series from back in the day, though by our recollection the battery life would plummet if any attempt was made to use the PCMCIA slot. It was only one of several similar platforms offering a mini-laptop experience, and we feel its sad that there are so few similar machines today. Perhaps well keep an eye out for one and relive the 90s ourselves.", "title": "\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\uff08PDA\uff09\uff1a\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5143\u7956", "body": "HP Journada 720, a Personal Digital Assistant from the turn of the millennium, has a half-decent keyboard, runs on Windows CE OS, and has Linux distro that can run modern apps.

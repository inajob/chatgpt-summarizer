[Niklas Frost]s father has MS and uses an electric mobility scooter to get around. Its a good solution to a terrible problem, except it stops short of the most important part  the charging scheme. Because of the aforementioned mobility issues, [Niklas]s father cant plug and unplug it without assistance. So much for independence.\nAnd so [Niklas] gave it some thought and came up with an incredibly easy way that Dad can charge his scooter. Its even non-intrusive  all it took was a handful of off-the-shelf components and some 3D printed parts to make whats essentially an extension cord between the charger and the scooter. Really, theres nothing more to it than three 10 A magnetic connectors, an XLR female port, an XLR male connector, and some very helpful plastic.\nSomething interesting to note: [Niklas] spent a year or so tinkering with a robot that could drive the plug over to the charger and plug it in. A book on the subject made him destroy that robot, however, when he realized that he was being driven more by cool technologies than solving the problem at hand. Within a few days of changing course, [Niklas] dad was charging his own scooter.\nNow, if [Niklas] wants to see about making the scooter move a whole lot faster, we have just the thing.", "title": "\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u7236\u304c\u4f7f\u3046\u96fb\u52d5\u30e2\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u304c\u81ea\u7acb\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u8003\u6848\u3057\u305f[Niklas Frost]\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3068\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u5145\u96fb\u5668\u5ef6\u9577\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u6280\u8853\u306e\u8ffd\u6c42\u3088\u308a\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u3001\u6539\u5584\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6539\u5584\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u958b\u767a", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3068XLR\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u7236\u306e\u70ba\u306b\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u81ea\u7acb\u5145\u96fb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u6280\u8853\u3088\u308a\u3082\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u52d5\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f"]}

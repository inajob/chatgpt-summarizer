[Niklas Frost]s father has MS and uses an electric mobility scooter to get around. Its a good solution to a terrible problem, except it stops short of the most important part  the charging scheme. Because of the aforementioned mobility issues, [Niklas]s father cant plug and unplug it without assistance. So much for independence.\nAnd so [Niklas] gave it some thought and came up with an incredibly easy way that Dad can charge his scooter. Its even non-intrusive  all it took was a handful of off-the-shelf components and some 3D printed parts to make whats essentially an extension cord between the charger and the scooter. Really, theres nothing more to it than three 10 A magnetic connectors, an XLR female port, an XLR male connector, and some very helpful plastic.\nSomething interesting to note: [Niklas] spent a year or so tinkering with a robot that could drive the plug over to the charger and plug it in. A book on the subject made him destroy that robot, however, when he realized that he was being driven more by cool technologies than solving the problem at hand. Within a few days of changing course, [Niklas] dad was charging his own scooter.\nNow, if [Niklas] wants to see about making the scooter move a whole lot faster, we have just the thing."}

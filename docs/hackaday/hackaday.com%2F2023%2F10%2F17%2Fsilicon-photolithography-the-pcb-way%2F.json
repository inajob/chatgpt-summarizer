Next up: exploring down-and-dirty photolithography methods.\nIf youve been following along with this series  and why wouldnt you?  youll recall [ProjectsInFlight]s earlier experiments, like creating oxide layers on silicon chips with a homebrew tube furnace and exploring etchants that can selectively remove them. But just blasting away the oxide layer indiscriminately isnt really something you need to do when etching the fine features needed to fabricate a working circuit. The trouble is, most of the common photoresist solutions used by commercial fabs are unobtainium for hobbyists, leading to a search for a suitable substitute.\nSurprisingly, PCB photoresist film seemed to work quite well, but not without a lot of optimization by [ProjectsInFlight] to stick it to the silicon using a regular laminator. Also in need of a lot of tweaking was the use of a laser printer to create masks for the photolithography process on ordinary transparency film, including the surprisingly effective method of improving the opacity of prints with acetone vapor. There were also extensive experiments to determine the best exposure conditions, a workable development process, and the right etchants to use. Watch the video below for a deep dive into all those topics as well as the results, which are pretty good.\nTheres a lot to be said for the methodical approach that [ProjectsInFlight] is taking here. Every process is explored exhaustively, with a variety of conditions tested before settling on what works best. Its also nice to see that pretty much all of this has been accomplished with the most basic of materials, all of which are easily sourced and pretty cheap to boot. Were looking forward to more of the same here, as well as to see what others do with this valuable groundwork.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u9020", "body": "[ProjectsInFlight]\u306fDIY\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u9020\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u8a18\u4e8b\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u3001\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u306e\u5fae\u7d30\u306a\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6750\u6599\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7279\u306b\u3001PCB\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u304c\u6709\u671b\u306a\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u63a5\u7740\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3001\u666e\u901a\u306e\u900f\u660e\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u9732\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u3084\u73fe\u50cf\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ea\u30bd\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u6280\u8853\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u9020", "PCB\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b8\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u5149\u9020\u5f62\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30a2\u30bb\u30c8\u30f3\u84b8\u6c17\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5370\u5237\u54c1\u306e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u6700\u9069\u306a\u9732\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u3068\u73fe\u50cf\u6750\u306e\u9078\u5b9a\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u89e3\u8aac"]}

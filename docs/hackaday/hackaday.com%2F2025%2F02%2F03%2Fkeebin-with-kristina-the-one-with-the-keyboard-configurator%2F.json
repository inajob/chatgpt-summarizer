Well, [heyisjambo] says that its more than possible with menura, the modular keyboard system.\nSo many lovely options! Image by [heyisjambo] via GitHub[heyisjambo] is happy with 36 keys, but is reduced-count-curious and wanted a way to explore without a lot of wasted time and PCBs.\nAt the same time, [heyisjambo] wanted to experiment with split vs. uni-body construction, and especially the different shapes that are possible when tweaking the angle and distance between them.\nAnd as if that werent enough, theres support for [Sadek Baroudi]s\u00a0VIK standard for interfacing data between PCBs, which calls for an FPC 12-pin, 0.5 mm pitch connector and allows for ultra-cool magnetic connectors. This way, you can easily add things like displays, trackpads, and trackballs in the between the halves.\nThanks for the tip, [calculus]!\n\nCosmos Keyboard Configurator Is Out of This World\nWell, this is probably the coolest thing Ive seen this week. Cosmos is an utterly customizable keyboard configurator by [Lost Pistachio] that uses a scan of your hand to figure out what thumb clusters, curvature, and layout are right for you, without wasting time and plastic on physical prototypes.\u00a0 You should go check it out, especially to see the cool and noodly finger animations in the demo.\nImage by [LostPistachio] via Cosmos Keyboard ConfiguratorAt the top left youll find Basic, Advanced, and Expert modes, where Expert is playing directly with the code. You can mess with the thumb cluster keys by moving them around directly with the mouse. You want a trackball? Boom, trackball.\nDid I mention that it does all this in the browser? Oh, except for a couple of things things, which are accessible with a PRO account. This costs a measly $10 and is good for a lifetime, yours or theirs.\nYes, there are a lot of settings, but its easy enough to get started with the docs page, which outlines some recommendations for everything from the layout to the microcontroller.\nThanks for the tip, [Timoth\u00e9e]!\nThe Centerfold: The Hacktrick\nImage by [tschibo00] via redditNo, this isnt some sci-fi prop. Its real, and its spectacular. This is [tschibo00]s Hacktrick  a gasket-mounted keyboard that uses converted key tops from an IBM Selectric I typewriter. The golf ball type element is not just for looks  its mounted on a special adapter and acts as encoder to scroll up/down, left/right, and push down.\nThe switches are mounted sideways in order to accept the keycaps without an adapter. Since the Selectric key tops are normally mounted on levers and wider in the north-south direction, the switches must be rotated, and a cross-slit Dremeled into the underside of each beautiful, double-shot key top. This way, they can still be used on a Selectric. In case youre wondering, that case was resin-printed by a board house, although [tschibo00] sanded, painted, and clear-coated it many times.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Bennett/Junior\nIntroduced in 1907, the Junior was Charles Almon Bennetts first typewriter. It had no paper table and utilized ink rollers. Evidently, it had numerous issues with alignment. But one thing is certain; this was truly a pocket-sized typewriter.\nImage by [Lucas Dul] via The Mechanical TypeThese issues were all addressed with Bennetts second machine, which he named after himself. The Bennett had a paper table, ribbon spools, and no alignment issues. Even so, it was difficult to type on.\nFirst off, the keys are way too close together, which is just bad for typing in general, plus it made the wrists begin to ache after a while.\nAnd you see how they overlap? Pressing one depresses the keys beneath it as well  hit Q, and A and Z go down with it. But hey, at least its ortholinear, eh? And plus, look where the Space bar is.\nThese things are small: just 11 x 5 x 2 and a mere 4.5 pounds. They have the honor of being the smallest typewriters ever manufactured with full keyboards. If you want to take a deeper dive into one of these machines, be sure to check out [Lucas Dul]s exploration of a Junior. You may remember [Lucas] from a previous Keebin.\nTheres Nothing Wooden About This Design\nLook, I dont happen to have any experience clacking on a wooden keyboard, although I welcome it with open arms. And unless I get some serious skills and/or cash, its probably going to be a while.\nImage via Yanko Design\nThat said, the folks at Yanko Design got their hands on an Alice60 made (almost) completely out of wood, and rave about the sound, the tactility, the whole nine.\nWe know what plastic sound and feels like. But even the nicest plastics get slick over time with finger oils. Im not saying that will magically go away with a wooden keyboard, only that one can imagine the oils seasoning the wood rather that ruining it.\nThis offering from Epomaker x Feker is currently available for pre-order for a cool $549. Not bad for something so lovely, which will undoubtedly provide a keyboarding experience like none other.\nThis is certainly not the first wooden keyboard weve seen, and its not even the first commercial offering. If youre not into ergonomics and have the means to spend twice as much, check out this wooden rectangle from Hacoa. If you want to make one yourself, take a look at [Bo Yao]s carpenter tau number, or [Steve M. Potter]s Scrabble tile affair.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

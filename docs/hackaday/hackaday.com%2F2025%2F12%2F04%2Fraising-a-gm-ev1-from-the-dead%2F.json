This was the famous electric car produced in small numbers by the automaker in the 1990s, then only made available for lease before being recalled. The vast majority were controversially crushed with a few units being donated to museums and universities in a non-functional state.\nFinding an old car isnt really a Hackaday story in itself, but now its landed in [The Questionable Garage]. Its being subjected to a teardown as a prelude to its restoration, offering a unique opportunity to look at the state of the art in 1990s electric automotive technology.\nThe special thing about this car is that by a murky chain of events it ended up as an abandoned vehicle. GMs legal net covers the rest of the surviving cars, but buying this car as an abandoned vehicle gives the owner legal title over it and frees him from their restrictions. The video is long, but well worth a watch as we see pieces of automotive tech never before shown in public. As we understand it the intention is to bring it to life using parts from GMs contemporary S10 electric pickup truck  itself a rare vehicle  so we learn quite a bit about those machines too.\nAlong the way they find an EV1 charger hiding among a stock of pickup chargers, take us through the vehicle electronics, and find some galvanic corrosion in the cars structure due to water ingress. The windscreen has a huge hole, which they cover with a plastic wrap in order to 3D scan so they can create a replacement.\nThis car will undoubtedly become a star of the automotive show circuit due to its unique status, so there will be plenty of chances to look at it from the outside in future. Seeing it this close up in parts though is as unique an opportunity as the car itself. Weve certainly seen far more crusty conventional cars restored to the road, but without the challenge of zero parts availability and no donor cars. Keep an eye out as they bring it closer to the road.\n\n", "title": "- \u300cGM EV1\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u304c\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u767b\u5834\uff01\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "GM\u306eEV1\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u304c\u5ec3\u8eca\u5834\u304b\u3089\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u4fee\u5fa9\u3055\u308c\u308b\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300cGM EV1\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u304c\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u767b\u5834\uff01\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5fa9\u5143\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "- \u300c1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u6280\u8853\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b\u3059\u308b\uff1aGM EV1\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u4f5c\u696d\u300d", "- \u300c\u5ec3\u8eca\u304b\u3089\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3078\uff01GM EV1\u306e\u7279\u7570\u306a\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3068\u305d\u306e\u904e\u53bb\u300d", "- \u300cGM EV1\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3068\u6311\u6226\u300d", "- \u300c\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aGM EV1\u306e\u89e3\u4f53\u3068\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u9053\u300d"]}

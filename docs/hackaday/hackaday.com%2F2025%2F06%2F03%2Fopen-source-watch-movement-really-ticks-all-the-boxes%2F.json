Yet open source is an ethos and license, and is in no way limited to electronics. The openmovement foundation is a case in point a watch case, to be specific. The movement in Openmovement is a fully open-source and fully mechanical watch movement.\nOpenmovement has already released STEP files of OM10 the first movement developed by the group. (You do need to sign up to download, however.) They say the design is meant to be highly serviceable and modular, with a robust construction suited for schools and new watchmakers. The movement uses a Swiss pallets escapement we think thats an odd translation of lever escapement, but if youre a watchmaker let us know in the comments), and runs at 3.5 Hz / 25,200 vph. An OM20 is apparently in the works, as well, but it looks like only OM10 has been built from what we can see.\nIf you dont have the equipment to finely machine brass from the STEP files, Openmovement is running a crowdfunding campaign to produce kits of the OM10, which you can still get in on until the seventh of June.\nIf youre wondering what it takes to make a mechanical watch from scratch, we covered that last year. Spoiler: it doesnt look easy. Just assembling the tiny parts of an OM10 kit would seem daunting to most of us. That might be why most of the watches weve covered over the years werent mechanical, but at least they tend to be open source, too."}

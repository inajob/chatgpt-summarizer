These games feature a claw the player moves into position above a pile of toys or other items. Lower the claw gently down in the hopes that it grabs the target item. In a perfect world, the claw will move your prize and deposit it, via a chute, into your waiting hands. Of course, everyone knows that these games are rigged and rely less on skill or luck than the way that they are programmed, but the way that this works is quite subtle, as you can see in the video below.\nDespite how complex these crane claws may appear, they are simply solenoids, with the metal rod inside providing the claw action. The weight of the rod and claw section opens the claw via gravity. The strength of the claw is thus fully dependent on how strongly the solenoid is being driven, which, as [Clive] demonstrates, depends on the voltage and the duty cycle. At only 12V, the target plushie will easily slip away again as the claw barely has any strength, while at 24V, its pretty solid.\n\nThe basic way these crane games are programmed is to use a voltage and/or duty cycle that depends on the amount of money spent (in credits) and the monetary value of the items you can win. If youre very lucky youll get a solid catch even with a floppy claw. Most of the time youll have to wait until you get a solid claw. While a simple concept, it seems more designed to game the player. As [Clive] duly notes, just buying the item will probably save you a lot of money and frustration.\nOr, build your own, of course. There are plenty of examples.\n", "title": "- \u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\uff1a\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "body": "\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3084\u7279\u6027\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u5f37\u3055\u306f\u96fb\u5727\u306b\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u9a19\u3059\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\uff1a\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u5f79\u5272", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u898b\u308b\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8b0e", "- \u96fb\u5727\u3068\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u304c\u52dd\u6557\u3092\u6c7a\u3081\u308b\uff1f\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\uff1a\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "- \u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u653b\u7565\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

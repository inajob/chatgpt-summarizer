If so, you might find a display library from [dejwk] to be particularly useful.\nNamed roo_display for unclear reasons, the library is Arduino-compatible, and suits a wide range of ESP32 boards out in the wild. Its intended for use with common SPI-attached display controllers, like the ILI9341, SSD1327, ST7789, and more. Its performance-oriented, without skimping on feature set. Its got all kinds of fonts in different weights and sizes, and a tool for importing more. It can do all kinds of shapes if you want to manually draw your UI elements, or you can simply have it display JPEGs, PNGs, or raw image data from PROGMEM if you so desire. If youre hoping to create a touch interface, it can handle that too. Theres even a companion library for doing more complex work under the name roo_windows.\nIf youre looking to create a simple and responsive interface, this might be the library for you. Of course, there are others out there too, like the Adafruit GFX library which weve featured before. You could even go full VGA if you wanted, and end up with something that looks straight out of Windows 3.1. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own graphics code for the popular microcontroller platform, you should probably let us know on the tipsline!\nThanks to [Daniel] for the tip!"}

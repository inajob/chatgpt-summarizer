Imagine you want to put a hole into a surface. The program needs to know on which surface to put the hole, and so it refers to this surface by name / number. Now imagine you subdivide the surface, and both subsections get new names. Where does your hole go now?\u00a0 If you want to dig into the issue, the inimitable [MangoJelly] has a great video about the topo naming problem. Practically, there were workarounds, like only adding chamfers after the main design has stabilized, but frankly it was a hassle to remember all of the tricks. This is a huge fix.\nThe second big fix concerns assemblies.\u00a0 Older versions of FreeCAD were great for making single parts, but combining them all together inside the CAD program was always janky.\u00a0 Version 1.0 combines the previous two patchwork assembly workbenches into one, and its altogether more pleasant to use. The constraints of how two parts move when held together with an axle just works now, and this is a big deal for multi-part models.\nIf youre coming from any other parametric CAD program, most of FreeCAD will seem familiar to you, but there will also be workflow differences that will take some getting used to. In trade, what do you get? Scriptability in Python, real open source software, and all of the bells and whistles for free. Now that its two biggest pain points have been addressed,\u00a0 FreeCAD has become a lot easier to love. Were looking forward to some good V1.0 tutorials in the future, and well keep you posted when we find them."}

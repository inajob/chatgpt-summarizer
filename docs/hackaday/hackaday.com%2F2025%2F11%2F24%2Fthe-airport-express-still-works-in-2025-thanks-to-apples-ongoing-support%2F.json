In 2004, along came the AirPort Express\u2014a fully-functional router the size of a laptop charger, that offered audio streaming to boot. As [schvabek] found out that while a lot of older Apple gear has long ago been deprecated, the AirPort Express is still very much supported and functional to this day!\nGenerally, you wouldnt expect to plug in a 20-year-old Apple accessory and have it work with the companys modern hardware. However, upon slotting the AirPort Express into a wall socket and starting the initialization process, [schvabek] noted that it was detected perfectly well by his post-2020 Macs. Only, there was a small problem\u2014the configuration process would always stall out before completion.\nThankfully, there was a simple remedy. [schvabek] found that he could connect to the AirPort Express with his classic white plastic MacBook and complete the process. From there, he was astonished that Apples servers let him pull down a firmware update for a device from 2004. After that upgrade, the AirPort Express was fully functional with all his modern Apple gear. He could readily stream audio from his iPhone and MacBooks with no compatibility issues whatsoever.\nIts nice to see Apple still supporting this ancient hardware to this day. Its a nice contrast when companies like Sonos are more than happy to brick thousands of old devices just for the sake of progress.\n", "title": "- 20\u5e74\u524d\u306eAirPort Express\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eMac\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01", "body": "Apple\u306f1999\u5e74\u306bAirPort\u3092\u767a\u58f2\u3057\u300120\u5e74\u524d\u306eAirPort Express\u304c\u4eca\u3082\u6a5f\u80fd\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 20\u5e74\u524d\u306eAirPort Express\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306eMac\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01", "- Apple\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3001AirPort Express\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u308a", "- AirPort Express\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u66f4\u65b0\u3067\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u9023\u643a\u6210\u529f", "- Apple\u304c\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304dAirPort Express\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u97f3\u697d\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u518d\u3073\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001AirPort Express\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

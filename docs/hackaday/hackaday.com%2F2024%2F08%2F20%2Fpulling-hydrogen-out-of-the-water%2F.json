In practice, doing it well can be tricky. [Relic] shows an efficient way to produce an electrolysis cell using a few plastic peanut butter jars and some hardware.\nThe only tricky point is that you need hardware made of steel and not zinc or other materials. Well, that and the fact that the gasses you produce are relatively dangerous.\n\nTo that end, [Relic] includes an I dont want to explode switch in the system by routing tubes of gas through a second jar filled with water so that the water will block its return.\nOf course, weve seen the same setup created with a battery, two coils of wire, and some test tubes, but this can certainly produce more hydrogen faster. Like most of these designs, you can scale them by adding more steel parts. The more surface area, the more gas youll produce.\nWeve seen a number of similar generators before, but each one is a little different. If you want to get really fancy, you can turn to automation."}

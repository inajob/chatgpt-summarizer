[Levi Kelly] decided to see how small you could make an RV. [via Autopian]\nWhile we wont argue one way or another on his claim to worlds smallest, as that likely depends on your definition of an RV, starting with a kei truck certainly puts you in a more compact format than something built on a bus chassis. With four wheel drive and a small footprint, this could be better for overlanding than the Rivian bed camper we featured recently.\nThe 21 sq. ft. (1.95 m2) camper portion itself is framed in 2 x 2s (38 x 38 mm) to save weight and uses foam board insulation. A working faucet uses a pump to draw drinking water from a 5 gallon (19L) refillable jug and empties into a 7 gallon (26L) grey water tank. A solar panel on the roof charges the battery that drives the pump, ventilation fan, and can also be used to run other devices like a hot plate for cooking.\nA teeny tiny wood stove can be used for heat, although [Kelly] is using a different fuel source to reduce unpredictability from a wood fire in such a small space. A faucet-mounted sprayer can be routed to the outside of the camper to create a makeshift shower and is run from the sink water system. Theres even a small cabinet above the foot area of the bed to house a portable toilet and a bubble window to observe your surroundings while you do your business.\nWeve seen some even smaller campers, like this vintage-inspired bike camper, or this more streamlined version. If you want the most efficient RV ever then check out this solar-powered one.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6975\u9650\uff1a\u5c0f\u578bRV\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u5c0f\u578bRV\u3067\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u306f\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u8efd\u91cf\u7d20\u6750\u4f7f\u7528\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3084\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u3001\u7c21\u6613\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u5b8c\u5099\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6975\u9650\uff1a\u5c0f\u578bRV\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u8efd\u30c8\u30e9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f21\u5e73\u65b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5feb\u9069\u7a7a\u9593", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u7701\u30a8\u30cd\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u3082\u6a5f\u80fd\u5145\u5b9f\uff1aDIY\u30df\u30cb\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u81ea\u7136\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\uff1a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306aRV\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5"]}

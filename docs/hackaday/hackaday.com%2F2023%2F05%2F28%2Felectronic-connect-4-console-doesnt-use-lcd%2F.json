This lets even a modest microcontroller easily control a 64-pixel screen. In this case, [Mirko] uses an Arduino Nano, 3 switches, and a buzzer along with some 3D printed components to make a good-looking game. You can see it in action in the video below.\nThe WS2812B panels are easy to use since the devices have a simple protocol where you only talk to the first LED. You send pulses to determine each LEDs color. The first LED changes color and then starts repeating what you send to the next LED, which, of course, does the same thing. When you pause a bit, the array decides you are done, and the next train of pulses will start back at the first LED.\nIt looks like the project is based on a German project from [Bernd Albrecht], but our German isnt up to snuff, and machine translation always leaves something to be desired. Another developer added a play against the computer mode. This is a simple program and would be easy to port to the microcontroller of your choice. [Mirko]s execution of it looks like it could be a commercial product. If you made one as a gift, we bet no one would guess you built it yourself.\nOf course, you could play a real robot. You could probably repurpose this hardware for many different games, too.\n\n"}

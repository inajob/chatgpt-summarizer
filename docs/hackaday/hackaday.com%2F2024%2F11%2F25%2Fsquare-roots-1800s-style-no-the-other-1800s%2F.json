How did they know that? We dont know for sure how they computed it, but experts think it is the same as the ancient Greek method written down by Hero. It is a specialized form of the Newton method. You can follow along and learn how it works in the video below.\nThe method is simple. You guess the answer first, then you compute the difference and use that to adjust your estimate. You keep repeating the process until the error becomes small enough for your purposes.\n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to take the square root of 85. You can observe that 9 squared is 81, so the answer is sort of 9, right? But thats off by 4 (85-81=4). So you take that number and divide it by the current answer (9) multiplied by two. In other words, the adjustment is 4/18 or 0.2222. Putting it together, our first answer is 9.2222.\nIf you square that, you get about 85.05 which is not too bad, but if you wanted closer you could repeat the process using 9.2222 in place of the 9. Repeat until the error is as low as you like. Our calculator tells us the real answer is 9.2195, so that first result is not bad. A second pass gives 9.2193, You could keep going, but thats close enough for almost any purpose.\nThe video shows a geographical representation, and if you are a visual thinker, that might help you. We prefer to think of it algebraically. You are essentially creating each adjustment by adding the guess and the square divided by the guess and averaging them.\nThe ancients loved to estimate numbers. And Hero was into a lot of different things.\n", "title": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u30d0\u30d3\u30ed\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u8a08\u7b97\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "body": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u30d0\u30d3\u30ed\u30cb\u30a2\u306e tablette \u3067\u30012\u306e\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\uff081.41421\uff09\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u8aac\u660e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u4ee3\u30d0\u30d3\u30ed\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u8a08\u7b97\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77e5\u6075", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u63a8\u6e2c\u3068\u4fee\u6b63\u3067\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u6570\u5b66\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a\u30d0\u30d3\u30ed\u30cb\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u306e\u8a08\u7b97", "\u8996\u899a\u7684\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u3067\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u306e\u6c42\u3081\u65b9"]}

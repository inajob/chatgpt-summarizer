We kicked things off in a seasonally appropriate way with a PCB Christmas card that harvests power from your microwave or WiFi router, plus has the potential to be a spy tool. We learned how to grow big, beautiful crystals quickly, just in case you need some baubles for the tree or a nice pair of earrings. Speaking of last-minute gifts, perhaps you could build a packable dipole antenna, a very durable PCB motor, or a ridiculously bright Fibonacci simple add-on for your latest conference badge. We also looked into taking a shortcut to homebrew semiconductors via scanning electron microscopes, solved the mystery of early CD caddies, and discussed the sad state of table saw safety and the lamentable loss of fingers, or fractions thereof.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the zero-calorie MP3.\n\nEpisode 301 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams return to Earth delayed until at least March\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill in this form for your chance to win.\u00a0 Be as specific as you can!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nWhere This Xmas Card\u2019s Going, We Don\u2019t Need Batteries!\nAutomated Rig Grows Big, Beautiful Crystals Fast\nEnabling NVMe On The Raspberry Pi 500 With A Handful Of Parts\n\nNew Raspberry Pi 400 Is A Computer In A Keyboard For $70\n\n\nHomebrew Electron Beam Lithography With A Scanning Electron Microscope\nPCB Motor Holds Fast, Even After 1.6 Billion Spins\n\nSuperconference Interview: Carl Bugeja\n\u201cWhat Good Is a New-born Baby?\u201d  Benjamin Franklin (probably)\n\n\nSee What \u2018They\u2019 See In Your Photos\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nA Red Ring Light Show For Your Xbox 360\n3D Printed Blaster Does It With Compliant Components\nPulling Backward To Go Forward: The Brennan Torpedo Explained\nBuilding The Spectacular Fibonacci128 Simple Add-On\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nWago Terminals Make This Ham Radio Dipole Light And Packable\nWhy NASA Only Needs Pi To So Many Decimal Places\nCatching The View From The Edge Of Space\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nWhy Did Early CD-ROM Drives Rely On Awkward Plastic Caddies?\n\nCapacitance Electronic Disc  Wikipedia\n\n\nTech In Plain Sight: Table Saw Safety\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u304b\u3089\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u5f97\u308bPCB\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u524d\u306b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3001\u6676\u4f53\u6210\u9577\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u591a\u5f69\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u304b\u3089\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u5f97\u308bPCB\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u7c21\u5358\uff01\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u80b2\u3066\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u6301\u3061\u904b\u3073\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "- \u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u96fb\u5b50\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u5bb6\u88fd\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u88fd\u9020\u6cd5", "- \u5b89\u5168\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30bd\u30fc\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

And I\u2019ll admit that my first thought was \u201cwhy would you ever want to do that?\u201d (Not a very Hackaday-appropriate question, honestly.) The end result will certainly cost more than just buying a Pi Pico off the shelf!\nThen it hit me: this isn\u2019t a project per se, but rather [Kai] was using it as an test run to learn the PCB-production toolchain. And for that, replicating a Pico board is perfect, because the schematics are easily available. While I definitely think that a project like this is a bit complicated for a first PCB project \u2013 I\u2019d recommend making something fun like an SAO \u2013 the advantage of making something slightly more involved is that you run into all of the accompanying problems learning experiences. What a marvelous post-complete-beginner finger exercise!\nAnd then it hit me again. [Kai]\u2019s documentation of everything learned during the project was absolutely brilliant. It\u2019s part KiCAD tutorial, part journal about all the hurdles of getting a PCB made, and just chock-full of helpful tips along the way. The quality of the write-up turns it from being just a personal project into something that can help other people who are in exactly the same boat, and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a number of you out there.\nIn the end, this was a perfect Hackaday project. Yes, it was \u201ctoo simple\u201d for those who have made their 30th PCB design. (Although I\u2019d bet you could still pick up a KiCAD tip or two.) And yes, it doesn\u2019t make economic sense to replicate mass-market devices in one-off. And of course, it doesn\u2019t need that fun art on the board either. But wrap all these up together, and you get a superbly documented guide to a useful project that would walk you through 95% of what you\u2019ll need to make more elaborate projects later on. Superb!\nSurely you do \u201cfinger exercises\u201d too. Why not write them up, and share the learning? And send them our way \u2013 we know just the audience who will want to read it.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

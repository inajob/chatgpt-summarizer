The result is a work in progress, but one that looks awfully promising.\nThe main elements of the design are rotating pieces that indicate the hours and minutes, but each hour is advanced solely by the satisfying physical culmination of multiple interacting systems. Those systems also completely reset themselves every hour.\nEach hour, a marble run kicks off a short chain reaction that culminates in advancing the hour.\nAt the top of the hour, a marble starts down a track and eventually tips over a series of hinged dominoes, which culminate in triggering a spring-loaded ratchet that advances the hour. The marble then gets carried back to the top of the device, ready for next time. Meanwhile, the domino slats and spring-loaded ratchets all get reset by a pulley system.\nTheres still some work to do in mounting the motor, pulley system, and marble run. Also, a few bugs have surfaced, like a slight overshoot in the hour display. All par for the course for a device with such a large number of moving parts, we suppose.\n[Kelton] has a pretty good sense how it will all work in the end, and it looks promising. We cant wait to see it in its final form, but the tour of clock so far is pretty neat. Check it out in the video, embedded just under the page break.\nAs for the clocks inspiration, Rube Goldbergs cultural impact is hard to overstate and our own Kristina Panos has an excellent article about the man that might just teach you something you didnt know.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ad\u30cd\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u6301\u3064\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u4e2d\u306e[Kelton]\u306f\u3001\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u6f14\u51fa\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u3001Rube Goldberg\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ad\u30cd\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u6301\u3064\u72ec\u5275\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300cRube Goldberg\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d4\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u8aac\u660e\u3059\u308b\u30de\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u300d", "\u300c\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u52d5\u304f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6301\u3064\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u300d", "\u300c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u3068\u8ab2\u984c\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u300d"]}

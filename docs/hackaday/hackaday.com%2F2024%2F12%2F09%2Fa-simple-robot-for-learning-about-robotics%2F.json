Better to learn with something smaller and simpler to understand. This simple Arduino-powered robot is called Bug, and it aims to be just that.\nThe design comes to us from [Joshua Stanley]. Its based around the ubiquitous Arduino Uno, paired with a motor control and I/O shield for more connectivity. The robot uses treads for locomotion\u2014each side has two wheels wrapped in a belt for grip. The robot has a small DC gearmotor driving each belt so it can be driven forwards, backwards, and steered differentially. To perceive the world, it uses an off-the-shelf ultrasonic transceiver module, and an NRF24L01 module for remote control. All this is wrapped up in a basic 3D-printed housing that positions the ultrasonic modules effectively as eyes which is kind of cute, all in all.\nDespite its small size and simple construction, Bug gets around perfectly well in testing on an outdoor footpath. It even has enough torque to flip itself up at full throttle. For now, [Joshua] notes its a glorified remote control car, but he plans to expand it further with more functionality going forward.\nWe see lots of educational robots around these parts, like this nifty little robot arm. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Jan-Willem for the tip!]", "title": "- \u5c0f\u578bArduino\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBug\u300d\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "body": "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBug\u300d\u306f\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u5b66\u3073\u3084\u3059\u3044\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3084\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3001\u5c4b\u5916\u3067\u3082\u52d5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5c0f\u578bArduino\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBug\u300d\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01Arduino\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBug\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b69\uff01Arduino\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fBug\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3082\u3046\uff01Bug\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3068\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u5c55\u671b"]}

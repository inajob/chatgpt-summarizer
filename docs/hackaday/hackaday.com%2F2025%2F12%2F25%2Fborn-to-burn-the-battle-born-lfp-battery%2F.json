While the answer here is generally expected to be yes, especially compared to getting an unbranded LFP battery off eBay from a random seller, the outcome may not be that different. Case in point the 100 Ah, 12 VDC LFP Battle Born battery that [Will Prowse] took a look at to see why its positive terminal gets positively crispy.\nBattle Born battery positive terminal. (Credit: Will Prowse, YouTube)\nOnce the lid was cut off, its easy to see what the problem is: the positive terminal is only loosely attached to the bus bar, leading to extremely poor contact. It also appears that theres a plastic spacer which has properly melted already in this well-used battery that [Will] obtained from a viewer.\nThis overheating issue with Battle Born batteries has been reported for years now, which makes it a great idea to take a good look at any Battle Born LFP batteries you may have kicking around, as they may be plagued by the same design flaw. Trying to make use of the manufacturers warranty could be complicated based on the commentators in the DIY Solar Forum thread, as Battle Born likes to claim that the overheating issue is an external problem and not a design flaw.\nEither way, it looks like an incredibly sketchy way to design a battery terminal on an LFP battery that is supposed to surge 100+A. [Will] is requesting that anyone affected posts details in the forum or similar to get all information together, as he looks to push Battle Born on this issue.\nWhat makes this issue worse is that shortly after releasing that first video, Battle Born responded to some concerned customers with a response that claims that their terminal design is a thermal fail-safe, but as can be seen in [Will]s follow-up video, it absolutely doesnt look like one.\n\n\n", "title": "\u300cBattle Born LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u554f\u984c\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0d\u826f\u306e\u8b0e\u300d", "body": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u88fdLiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u6b20\u9665\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u304c\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cBattle Born LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u554f\u984c\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0d\u826f\u306e\u8b0e\u300d", "\u300c\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u6b20\u9665\uff1fBattle Born\u306e\u904e\u71b1\u554f\u984c\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d", "\u300cBattle Born\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\uff1a\u9867\u5ba2\u306e\u61f8\u5ff5\u3078\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u5fdc\u7b54\u300d", "\u300c\u8a2d\u8a08\u30df\u30b9\u304b\uff1fBattle Born\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u62b1\u3048\u308b\u554f\u984c\u306e\u771f\u76f8\u300d"]}

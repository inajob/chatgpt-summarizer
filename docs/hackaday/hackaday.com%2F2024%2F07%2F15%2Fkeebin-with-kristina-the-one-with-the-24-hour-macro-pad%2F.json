Why? Because as Hackadays own [Donald Papp] reminded us, we all need a win sometimes, especially as projects drag on and on without any end in sight.\nImage by [nibbler] via Toxic AntidoteAs [nibbler] points out, what really constitutes a win? Set the bar too low and it wont feel like one at all. Too high, and you may become too discouraged to cross the finish line. With that in mind, [nibbler] set the bar differently, limiting themselves to what could be done in the one day per week they have to devote time to electronic matters.\nOne-day turnaround usually means using parts on hand and limiting oneself to already-learned skills and techniques. No problem for [nibbler], who, armed with an Arduino Leonardo Tiny and a some colorful push buttons, set about designing a suitable enclosure, and then putting it all together. Was this a win? [nibbler] says yes, and so do I.\n\nKeycaps To Dye For\nImage by [Nosp1] via redditWhen I saw [Nosp1]s reddit post about dyeing their Moonlander keycaps, I remembered I was going to do that myself one of these days. While I was planning to use good ol Rit dye, [Nosp1] pointed to a video they watched that uses something called iDye Poly. Irritating name aside, this stuff looks like it does a fine job of dyeing keycaps evenly and vibrantly.\nIts important that you realize there is both iDye and iDye Poly out there, and the latter is what you want. The difference is mainly in the extra lump of stuff which is dubbed the color intensifier. You will also want a PBT keycaps for sure, not ABS, and a big strainer if you want to dye them more like Easter eggs.\nOnce youve gathered a pot to dye them in and some water, just turn up the heat to a simmer and stir in the iDye gunk until it dissolves. Throw in the keycaps, wait 10-15 minutes, and then rinse them off and let them dry and Bobs your proverbial uncle. The chap in the video below only did a handful of caps, which looks pretty snazzy.\n\nThe Centerfold: Six Sides of Miss Fifi\nImage by [pascuajr] via redditDespite all the angles presented here (and more here), we dont know a lot about [pascuajur]s keyboard, but thats okay. We do know that its a Fifi, which is open source, or you can buy one already made. Its nice to imagine that those switches are whatever color you want, isnt it?\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers:\u00a0 The Helios Typewriter\nImage via Antikey Chop\nSome people like their keyboards small, like really small. So small that they end up with more layers than a fancy restaurant dessert. Apparently this has pretty much always been the case, as evidenced by the Helios typewriter introduced in 1908.\nWith just two rows of ten keys each, Justin Wilhelm Bamberger  Co.s machine could output 80 characters total, thanks to a four-tier, cast-aluminium typewheel and three shift keys located to the left of the keyboard. You can get a closer look here, on a late model of the typewriter.\nOperation looked like this: whenever a key was pressed, the typewheel would spin and move forward to strike the paper. Not a whole lot seems to be known about these little machines. By 1909, production had been taken over by the Kanzler typewriter factory in Berlin. Both companies eventually dissolved, and by 1915, the rights were acquired by A. Ney  Co. who renamed it the Helios-Klimax.\nVia reddit\nICYMI: ErgO, Computer Interactions Can Be Comfortable\nImage by [Sophia] via Hackaday.IOOkay, so this is not a keyboard. But its definitely an input of interest. ErgO is a smart ring that acts as an HID to extend your keyboard and mouse with something much, much cooler. No longer will you be tied to the home row. Imagine sitting or standing in any position you want, controlling your computer with ease.\nErgO is built out of breakout boards, so its simple to recreate. It has a lot of features that you dont get with standard equipment, like ultra portability and device-switching capability.\nAt the heart of this ring is the Seeed Xiao nRF52840, which of course controls Bluetooth communication with your computer. Add to that a clickable Pimoroni trackball and some capacitive touch sensors, and you have a really capable smart ring that should be fairly easy to build or remix thanks to [Sophia]s detailed instructions.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly."}

Happily for Raspberry Pi 5 owners the Pi engineers have come up with a set of tweaks you dont have to be an overclocker to benefit from, working on the DRAM timings to extract a healthy speed boost. Serial Pi hacker [Jeff Geerling] has tested them and thinks they should be good for as much as 20% boost on a stock board. When overclocked to 3.2 GHz, he found an unbelievable 32% increase in performance.\nWere not DRAM experts here at Hackaday, but as we understand it they have been using timings from the Micron data sheets designed to play it safe. In consultation with Micron engineers they were able to use settings designed to be much faster, we gather by monitoring RAM temperature to ensure the chips stay within their parameters. Best of all, theres no need to get down and dirty with the settings, and they can be available to all with a firmware update. Its claimed this will help Pi 4 owners to some extent as well as those with a Pi 5, so even slightly older boards get some love. So if you have a Pi 5, dont wait for the Pi 6, upgrade today, for free!", "title": "- Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6700\u592732%\u5411\u4e0a\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306aDRAM\u8abf\u6574\u6cd5", "- Jeff Geerling\u306b\u3088\u308bRaspberry Pi\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u5411\u4e0a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8", "- Raspberry Pi 4\u3082\u5bfe\u8c61\uff01\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u66f4\u65b0\u3067\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u7121\u6599\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01Raspberry Pi 5\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

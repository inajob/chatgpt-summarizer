They dont think, feel, or remember or do they? Bacteria dont have brains, and as far as we know, theyre incapable of thought. But could they react to an experience and recall it later?\nNew research suggests that some bacteria could have a rudimentary form of memory of their experiences in the environment. They could even pass this memory down across generations via a unique mechanism. Lets dive into the latest research that is investigating just what bacteria know, and how they happen to know it.\n\nYouve Been Here Before\nIn a groundbreaking study undertaken at the University of Texas, researchers have uncovered a surprising capability in bacteria: the formation of memory-like responses. These findings have challenged our understanding of bacterial behavior and could open new avenues in microbial research. \u201cBacteria don\u2019t have brains, but they can gather information from their environment, and if they have encountered that environment frequently, they can store that information and quickly access it later for their benefit,\u201d said lead author Souvik Bhattacharyya, who studies antibiotic resistance in bacterial swarms.\nThe study focused on Escherichia coli, a model organism, to observe how bacteria respond to environmental stimuli. The research team found that E. coli can effectively store data of past encounters with specific conditions. Cellular iron levels are used to remember behavioural patterns. This phenomenon, described as an iron-based memory, enables bacteria to react more efficiently to familiar stimuli by drawing on this memory.\nBacteria, devoid of neurons and a nervous system, use iron levels as a cue to form memory-like responses. High iron levels in the single-celled organisms cause the bacteria to form biofilms and remain relatively stationary. Conversely, bacteria with low iron levels tend to undergo a swarming behavior, where bacteria move collectively over a surface. Remarkably, once exposed to low iron levels and an initial swarming event, the bacteria seem able to recall this state in future. When put in a similar situation again, these bacteria showed improved swarming ability, as if they had remembered how from their past encounter.\nE. Coli use flagella to swim around during a swarming event. Credit: CDC, public domain\nOf course, it bears noting that bacteria dont have the longest lives. However, the iron-based memory can be passed down through the generations. Its not permanent, but can last through up to four generations. Theyre entirely eliminated naturally by the seventh generation. Artificial manipulation of iron levels can extend this duration, suggesting a complex interplay between environmental factors and bacterial behavior.\nThe current working theory is that the bacteria are primed to swarm in low-iron environments so they can seek out more iron to sustain themselves. In a high-iron environment, theres no need to waste energy moving about, so remaining stationary in a biofilm makes more sense to use the available resources already on hand.\nThis research has significant implications for combating bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance. Understanding how bacteria remember and respond to stressors like antibiotic exposure could lead to more effective therapeutic strategies. Iron levels, in particular, could be a target for new treatments, as they play a crucial role in bacterial virulence, according to Bhattacharyya,\nThe discovery of a rudimentary form of memory in bacteria is a major gain in the field of microbiology. It highlights that these microorganisms are far more sophisticated than we might otherwise imagine. It also underscores the need for continued research in understanding bacterial behaviors. This knowledge is vital for developing new strategies to fight bacterial infections and tackle antibiotic resistance. These problems arent going away anytime soon. Any research that can enlighten us further as to the secrets of bacterial behavior could be of great value in tackling these issues.\nFeatured image: Diverse e Coli by [Mattosaurus]", "title": "\u7d30\u83cc\u306b\u306f\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u5f62\u614b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c", "body": "\u8457\u540d\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001\u7d30\u83cc\u306f\u74b0\u5883\u3067\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u306e\u8584\u3044\u5f62\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u9244\u306e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u304c\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u5f62\u6210\u306b\u95a2\u4e0e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6642\u9593\u304c\u7d4c\u3064\u306b\u3064\u308c\u3066\u8584\u308c\u308b\u3002\u9244\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6cbb\u7642\u6cd5\u3084\u6297\u751f\u7269\u8cea\u8010\u6027\u5bfe\u7b56\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u7d30\u83cc\u306b\u306f\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u5f62\u614b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c", "\u7d30\u83cc\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u77e5\u898b\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u523a\u6fc0\u306b\u5fdc\u7b54\u3059\u308b\u80fd\u529b", "\u7d30\u83cc\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\uff1a\u9244\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u8a18\u61b6", "\u7d30\u83cc\u306e\u7e41\u6b96\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u77e5\u8b58\uff1a\u9244\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3068\u884c\u52d5\u306e\u76f8\u95a2\u6027", "\u7d30\u83cc\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\uff1a\u6297\u751f\u7269\u8cea\u8010\u6027\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3068\u6cbb\u7642\u6226\u7565\u306e\u767a\u5c55\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

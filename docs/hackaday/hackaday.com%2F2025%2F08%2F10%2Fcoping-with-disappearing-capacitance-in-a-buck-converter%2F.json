Unfortunately, even keeping percentage tolerances in mind isn\u2019t always enough to make sure that circuits work correctly in the real world, as [Tahmid] demonstrates by diagnosing a buck converter with an oddly strong voltage ripple in the output. Some voltage ripple is an inherent feature of the buck converter design, but it\u2019s inversely proportional to output capacitance, so most designs include a few smoothing capacitors on the output side. However, at 10 V and a 50% duty cycle, [Tahmit]\u2019s converter had a ripple of 0.75 V, significantly above the predicted variation of 0.45 V. The discrepancy was even greater at 20 V.The culprit was the effect of higher voltages on the ceramic smoothing capacitors: as the voltage increases, the dielectric barrier in the capacitors becomes less permittive, reducing their capacitance. Fortunately, unlike in the case of electrolytic capacitors, the degradation of ceramic capacitors performance with increasing voltage is usually described in specification sheets, and doesn\u2019t have to be manually measured. After finding the reduced capacitance of his capacitors at 10 V, [Tahmid] calculated a new voltage ripple that was only 14.5% off from the true value.Anyone who\u2019s had much experience with electronics will have already learned that passive components \u2013 particularly capacitors \u2013 aren\u2019t as simple as the diagrams make them seem. On the bright side, they are constantly improving.", "title": "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u3092\u8a3a\u65ad\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08\u306f\u7d19\u4e0a\u3067\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3060\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u3067\u306f\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u7279\u6027\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30bf\u30d2\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3092\u8a3a\u65ad\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u3092\u8a3a\u65ad\u3059\u308b", "- \u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u56de\u8def\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u6ce8\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u7279\u6027", "- \u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u305d\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u96fb\u5727\u5909\u52d5\u3092\u4e88\u6e2c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u7279\u6027\u7406\u89e3", "- \u30d1\u30c3\u30b7\u30d6\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u3068\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u9032\u5c55"]}

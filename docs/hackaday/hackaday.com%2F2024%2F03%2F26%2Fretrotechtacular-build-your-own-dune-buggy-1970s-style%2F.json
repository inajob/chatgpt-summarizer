If you didnt have a dune buggy or a van with outrageously flared arches and an eye-hurting paint job you were nothing in those days  or at least thats what those of us who were too young to possess such vehicles except as posters on our bedroom walls were led to believe. Periscope Films have put up a period guide from the early 1970s on how to build your own dune buggy, and can we just say its got us yearning to drive something just as outrageous?\nOf course, auto salvage yards arent bursting with Beetles as donor cars in 2024, indeed the accident-damaged model used in the film would almost certainly now be lovingly restored instead of being torn apart to make a dune buggy. Were taken through the process of stripping and shortening the Beetle floorpan, for which were thankful that in 2024 we have decent quality cutting disks, and watching the welder joining thin sheet metal with a stick welder gives us some serious respect for his skills.\nPerhaps the part of this video most likely to raise a smile is how it portrays building a car as easy. Anyone who has ever hacked a car to pieces will tell you thats the easy part, and its the building something from the pile of rusty parts which causes so many projects to fail. But given an accident damaged Beetle and a buggy kit in 1972 would we have dug in and given it a try? Of course!\nWeve touched on the Beetles hackability in the past, but some of us believe that the crown of most hackable car rests elsewhere.\n\n"}

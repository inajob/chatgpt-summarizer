[John Dingley] doesnt! Not since he created the Butta Melta to cozily snug a single butter serving right up against a warm beverage, softening it just enough to get nice and spreadable. Just insert one of those foil-wrapped pats of butter into the Melta, hang its chin on the edge of your mug, and youll have evenly softened butter in no time.\nThe Butta Melta is intentionally designed with a bit of personality, but also has features we think are worth highlighting. One is the way its clearly designed with 3D printing in mind, making it an easy print on just about any machine in no time at all. The second is the presence of the hinge point which really helps the Butta Melta conform to a variety of cup designs, holding the payload as close as possible to the heat regardless of cup shape. A couple of minutes next to a hot beverage is all it takes for the butter to soften enough to become easily spreadable.\nYou may remember [John] (aka [XenonJohn]) from his experimental self-balancing scooters, or from a documentary he made about domestic ventilator development during COVID. He taught himself video editing and production to make that, and couldnt resist using those skills to turn a video demo of the Butta Melta into a mock home shopping style advertisement. Watch it below, embedded just under the page break, then print one and save yourself from the tyranny of torn toast.\n\n", "title": "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u304f\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5857\u308c\u308b\u300cButta Melta\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u71b1\u3044\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u3067\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u304f\u3059\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u304f\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf", "- \u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6e29\u3081\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u306f", "- John Dingley\u306e\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf\u3001\u30c8\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5473\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30eb\u30bf\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u52d5\u753b\u89e3\u8aac"]}

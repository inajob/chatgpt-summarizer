He was doing a desktop clock build, and wanted to add gesture control to it  without any holes that a typical optical sensor needs. After some searching, hes found Microchips MGC3130, a gesture sensing chip that works with E-fields, more precise than the usual ones, almost as cheap, and with a lovely twist.\nThe coolest part about this chip is that it needs no case openings. The 3130 can work even behind obstructions like a 3D-printed case. You do need a PCB the size of a laptop touchpad, however  unlike the optical sensors easy to find from the usual online marketplaces. Still, if you have a spot, this is a perfect gesture-sensing solution. [RealCorebb] shows it off to us in the demo video.\nThis PCB design is available as gerbers+bom+schematic PDF. You can still order one from the files in the repo.\u00a0 Also, you need to use Microchips tools to program your preferred gestures into the chip. Still, it pays off, thanks to the chips reasonably low price and on-chip gesture processing. And, [RealCorebb] provides all the explanations you could need, has Arduino examples for us, links all the software, and even provides some Python scripts! Touch-sensitive technology has been getting more and more steam in hacker circles  for instance, check out this open-source 3D-printed trackpad.\n\n", "title": "- $5\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "$5\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308bMGC3130\u306e\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u969c\u5bb3\u7269\u8d8a\u3057\u3067\u3082\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u7a74\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- $5\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u7a74\u3092\u958b\u3051\u305a\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308bMGC3130\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u8d8a\u3057\u3067\u3082\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u8853", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\uff01Arduino\u5411\u3051\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30bb\u30f3\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6280\u8853"]}

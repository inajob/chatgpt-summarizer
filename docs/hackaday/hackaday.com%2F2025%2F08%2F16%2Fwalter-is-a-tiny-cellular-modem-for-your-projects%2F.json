So when [Data Slayer] titled his video Youve Never Seen Cellular Like This about a new GSM radio module, we couldnt help but think that we have  and that were glad to see it back.\nThe module is the Walter, by DPTechnics out of Belgium. Its fully open-source and contains a ESP32-S3 for WiFi and BLE plus a Sequans Monarch chip for GSM and GNSS connectivity. Its not the blazing-fast 5G youre paying your phone carrier for: this is an IoT modem, with LTE-M and NB-IoT. Were talking speeds in the kbps, not Mbps but were also talking very, very low power usage. Since its LTE-M rather than full LTE, youre probably not going to be bringing back the golden days of Arduino Cellphones, \u00a0(since LTE-M doesnt support VoLTE) but if LoRa isnt your jam, and you hang out around cell towers, this level of connectivity might interest you.\nWalter is actually a drop-in replacement for PyComs old GPy module, so if you had a project in mind for that and are frustrated by it being EoL  well, here you are. [Data Slayer] seemed impressed enough with its capabilities as a GPS tracker. Were impressed with the 9.8 \u00b5A consumed in deep sleep mode, and the fact that it has already been certified with the CE, FCC, IC, RCM and UKCA. Those certs mean you could go from prototype to product without getting tangled in red tape, assuming Walter is the only radio onboard.\nOur thanks to [Keith Olson] for phoning in the tip. If you have a tip and want to connect, operators are standing by.\n", "title": "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bb\u30eb\u30e9\u30fc\u63a5\u7d9a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u300cWalter\u300d\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9GSM\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u300cWalter\u300d\u306f\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u3067\u3001IoT\u63a5\u7d9a\u306b\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bb\u30eb\u30e9\u30fc\u63a5\u7d9a\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u300cWalter\u300d\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a2G\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d42\u7109\u3068\u300cWalter\u300d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- ESP32-S3\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9IoT\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0", "- GPS\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aWalter\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6027\u80fd", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u88fd\u54c1\u5316\u3078\u3001\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u8a8d\u8a3c\u624b\u7d9a\u304d\u306e\u5229\u70b9"]}

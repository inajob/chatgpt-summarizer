So many people sharing so much enthusiasm and hackery, and so many good times. It\u2019s a yearly dose of hacker mojo that we as Hackaday staff absolutely cherish, and we heard the same from many of the participants as well. We always come away with new ideas for projects, or new takes on our current top-of-the-heap obsession.\nIf you didn\u2019t get a chance to see the talks live, head on over to the Hackaday YouTube stream and get yourself caught up really quickly, because that\u2019s only half of the talks. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be writing up the other track of Design Lab talks and getting them out to you ASAP.\nIf you didn\u2019t get to join us because you are on an entirely different continent, well, that\u2019s a decent excuse. But if that continent is Europe, you can catch us up in the Spring of 2026, because we\u2019re already at work planning our next event on that side of the Atlantic.\nOur conferences always bring out the best of our community, and the people who show up are so amazingly positive, knowledgeable, and helpful. It\u2019s too bad that it can only happen a few times per year, but it surely charges up our hacker batteries. So thanks to all the attendees, presenters, volunteers, and sponsors who make it all possible!\n\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

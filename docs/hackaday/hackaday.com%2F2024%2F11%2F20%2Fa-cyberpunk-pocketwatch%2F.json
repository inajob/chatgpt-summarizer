[abe] built this cyberpunk LocknWatch to explore an alternate history for the once trendy device.\nThe build was inspired by the chunky looks of Casio sport watches and other plastic consumer electronics from the 1980s and 90s. The electronics portion of this project relies heavily on a 1.28 Seeed Studio Round Display and a Raspberry Pi 2040 XIAO microcontroller board. The final product features a faux segmented display for information in almost the same color scheme as your favorite website.\n[abe] spent a good deal of the time on this project iterating on the bezel and case to hold the electronics in this delightfully anachronistic enclosure. We appreciated the brief aside on the philosophical differences between Blender, TinkerCAD, and Fusion360. Once everything was assembled, he walks us through some of joys of debugging hardware issues with a screen flicker problem. We think the end result really fulfills the vision of a 1980s pocketwatch and that it might be just the thing to go with your cyberdeck.\nWeve seen accelerometers stuffed into old pocketwatch cases, a more useful smart pocketwatch, or you could learn how to repair and restore vintage watches.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u306a\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30f3\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u98a8\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u300cLocknWatch\u300d\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u30021980\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3084\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u306a\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30f3\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u500b\u6027\u7684\u306a\u8155\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9", "- \u30d3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3068\u518d\u751f\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

If youre creative and a little bit tricky, though, you can order pizza right from your Sega Dreamcast. You just need to jump through a few hoops, as demonstrated by [Delux] and [The Dreamcast Junkyard] in the recent past.\nYou used to be able to order pizza on the Dreamcast natively, all the way back in 1999. However, the modern Dominos website doesnt really work on the ancient Dreamcast browser anymore. The simple fact is that web technology has advanced a long way in the last couple of decades, and Sega didnt exactly spend a lot of time maintaining a browser on a console that died mere months after its rivals hit the market.\nThus, to place a pizza order on the Dreamcast these days, you need to work within its limitations. [Delux] uses the Dreamcast with the Broadband Adapter to access a PC on the local network via the XDP web browser. That PC is hosting Web Rendering Proxy, a tool which converts complicated modern websites into something a simpler machine can parse. From there, its a matter of connecting to the Dominos website, and slowly clicking through the online ordering pages. Between the proxy delay, the Dreamcasts glacial processing speed, and the clunky Dominos ordering interface, it takes\u00a0ages.\u00a0Never before has adding coupons felt like such a hassle. Still, after 15 minutes of fuss, the order is completed and a short time later, a hot fresh pizza arrives.\nIts a fun hack, but really its the PC running the proxy thats doing the heavy lifting. In 2026, its far more elegant to order a pizza from your Nintendo Wii.\n\n"}

McKown].\nFirst of all, I love the brass rails  they give it that lovely circuit sculpture vibe. This bad boy was written in Rust and currently runs on a SparkFun ProMicro RP2040 board. For the mouse portion of the program, theres an MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer.\n[akavel]s intent was to pair it with XR glasses, which sounds like a great combination to me. While typing is still a bit slow, [akavel] is improving at a noticeable pace and does some vim coding during hobby time.\nIn the future, [akavel] plans to try a BLE version, maybe even running off a single AA Ni-MH cell, and probably using an nRF52840. As for the 3D-printed shape, that was designed and printed by [akavel]s dear friend [Cunfusu], who has made the files available over at Printables. Be sure to check it out in the brief demo video after the break.\n\n\nWooden You Like To Use the Typewriter?\nImage by [bilbonbigos] via redditI feel a bit late to the party on this one, but thats okay, I made an nice entrance.\u00a0The Typewriter is [bilbonbigos] lovely distraction-free writing instrument that happens to be primarily constructed of wood. In fact, [bilbonbigos] didnt use any screws or nails  the whole thing is glued together.\nThe Typewriter uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+, and [bilbonbigos] is FocusWriter to get real work done on it. it runs off of a 10,000 mAh power bank and uses a 7.9 Waveshare display.\nThe 60% mechanical keyboard was supposed to be Bluetooth but turned out not to be when it arrived, so thats why you might notice a cable sticking out.\nThe whole thing all closed up is about the size of a ream of A4, and [bilbonbigos] intends to add a shoulder strap in order to make it more portable.\nThat cool notebook shelf doubles as a mousing surface, which is pretty swell and rounds out the build nicely. Still, there are some things [bilbonbigos] would change  a new Raspi, or a lighter different physical support for the screen, and a cooling system.\nThe Centerfold: A Keyboard For Your House In Palm Springs\nImage by [the_real_jamied] via redditCant you feel the space age Palm Springs breezes just looking at this thing? No? Well, at least admit that it looks quite atomic-age with that font and those life-preserver modifier keycaps. This baby would look great on one of those giant Steelcase office desks. Just dont spill your La Croix on it, or whatever they drink in Palm Springs.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: the Odell Typewriter\nFirst of all, the machine pictured here is not the true Odell number 1 model, which has a pair of seals feet at each end of the base and is referred to as the Seal-Foot Odell. Ye olde Seal-Foot was only produced briefly in 1889.\nImage via The Antikey Chop\nBut then inventor Levi Judson Odell completely redesigned the thing into what you see here  model 1b, for which he was awarded a patent in 1890. I particularly like the markings on the base. The nickel-plated, rimless model you see here was not typical; most had gold bases.\nThese babies cost 1/5th of a standard typewriter, and were quite easy to use to boot. With everything laid out in a line, it was far easier to use a slide mechanism than your ten fingers to select each character. On top of everything else, these machines were small enough to take with you.\nNo matter their appearance, or whether they typed upper case only or both, Odells were all linear index typewriters. The print element is called a type-rail. There is a fabric roller under the type-rail that applies ink to the characters as they pass. Pinch levers on the sides of the carriage did double duty as the carriage advance mechanism and the escapement.\nRound-based Odells went by the wayside in 1906 and were replaced by square-based New American No. 5 models. They functioned the same, but looked quite different.\nFinally, John Lennons Typewriter Is For Sale\nImage via Just Collecting\nGot an extra ten grand lying around? You could own an interesting piece of history.\nThis image comes courtesy of Paul Fraser Collectibles, who are selling this typewriter once owned and used by the legendary Beatle himself. While Lennon composed poems and songs on the machine, its unclear whether he secretly wanted to be a paperback writer.\nThis machine, an SCM (Smith-Corona Marchant) Electra 120, is an interesting one; its electric, but the carriage return is still manual. I myself have an SCM Secretarial 300, which looks very much the same, but has a frightening Power Return that sends the carriage back toward the right with enough power to shake the floor, depending upon the fortitude of your table.\nApparently Lennon would use the machine when traveling, but gave it to a close friend in the music industry when he upgraded or otherwise no longer needed it. A booking agent named Irwin Pate worked with this friend and obtained the typewriter from him, and Irwin and his wife Clarine held on to it until they sold it to Paul Fraser Collectibles. I find it interesting that this didnt go to auction at Christies  I think it would ultimately go for more, but Im a writer, not an auction-ologist.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Dont want all the Hackaday scribes to see it?

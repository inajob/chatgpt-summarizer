Rather than it being a cute-but-non-functional facsimile like recent miniature Nintendo and Commodore-themed releases, this particular console is 80% of the size of the original 7800 console, and accepts 2600 and 7800 cartridges, including a range of newly released cartridges.\nOn the outside you find the cartridge slot, an HDMI video/audio output, a USB-C port (for power) and DE-9 (incorrectly listed as DB-9) controller ports, with wireless controllers also being an option. Inside you find a (2014-vintage) Rockchip RK3128 SoC with a quad core Cortex-A7 that runs presumably some flavor of Linux with the Stella 2600 emulator and ProSystem 7800 emulator. This very likely means that compatibility with 2600 and 7800 titles is the same as for these emulators.\nBundled with the console is a new 7800 cartridge for the game Bentley Bears Crystal Quest, and a number of other new games are also up for pre-order at the Atari site. These games are claimed to be compatible with original Atari consoles, which might make it the biggest game release year for the 7800 since its launch, as it only had 59 official games released for it.\nGiven the backwards compatibility of this new system, you have to wonder how folks who purchased the 2600+ last year are feeling right about now. Then again, the iconic faux-wood trim of the earlier console might be worth the price of admission alone.", "title": "Atari\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044Atari 7800+\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u767a\u8868", "body": "Atari\u304cAtari 7800+\u3092\u767a\u58f2\u767a\u8868\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f130\u30c9\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u3001\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc2024\u307e\u3067\u767a\u9001\u30022600\u30687800\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba80\uff05\u306e\u672c\u7269\u3063\u307d\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3082\u4e88\u7d04\u53ef\u80fd\u30022600+\u8cfc\u5165\u8005\u306e\u53cd\u5fdc\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Atari\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044Atari 7800+\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u767a\u8868", "Atari 7800+\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u4e88\u7d04\u53d7\u4ed8\u4e2d", "Atari 7800+\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4ed5\u69d8\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd", "Atari 7800+\u306b\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0Bentley Bears Crystal Quest\u304c\u540c\u68b1", "Atari\u304c\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u3001Atari 7800+\u3092\u767a\u58f2"]}

Behold the Hades Widebody (HWD), a DIY PC VR headset that aims for a wide field of view and even manages to integrate some face and eye tracking.\nThe Fresnel elements hugging the primary lenses provide a way of extending the display into the wearers peripheral vision.\n[dragonskyrunner] is  and we quote  NEVER building one of these again. The reason is easily relatable to anyone who has spent a lot of time and effort creating something special: it does the job it was created for, but it also has limitations and is a lot of work. If one were to do it all over again, there would be a host of improvements and changes to consider. But one wont be doing it all over again any time soon because its done now.\nThe good news is that [dragonskyrunner] made an effort to document things, so there is at least a parts list and enough details for any suitably motivated hacker to replicate the work and perhaps even put their own spin on it.\nThe Hades Widebody has a dual-lens arrangement and wide displays that aim to provide a wider field of view than most setups allow. Theres a main lens in front of the users eyes and a cut Fresnel lens providing a sort of extension to the side. [dragonskyrunner] claims that while there is certainly not a seamless transition between the lens elements, it does a better job than an Ambilight at providing a sense of visuals extending into the wearers peripheral vision.\nThe DIY spirit of making a piece of hardware to suit ones own needs is exactly the sort of thing that would fit into our 2023 Cyberdeck content, and while a headset by itself isnt quite enough to qualify (devices must have some form of usable input and output), it just might get those creative juices flowing.", "title": "\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u306a\u8996\u754c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305fDIY PC VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eHades Widebody\uff08HWD\uff09\u306f\u3001\u5e83\u3044\u8996\u91ce\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u9854\u3068\u76ee\u306e\u8ffd\u8de1\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u305fDIY PC VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002Fresnel\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u4e3b\u306a\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5916\u5074\u306e\u8996\u91ce\u3082\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u518d\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u8a73\u7d30\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u306a\u8996\u754c\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305fDIY PC VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u3084\u30a2\u30a4\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u305fDIY PC VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u90e8\u54c1\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8", "\u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u3068\u5909\u66f4\u306e\u4f59\u5730", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u8996\u91ce\u3092\u5e83\u3052\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a66\u307f\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u30c7\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u914d\u7f6e\u3068\u30d5\u30ec\u30cd\u30eb\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "DIY\u7cbe\u795e\u3092\u523a\u6fc0\u3059\u308b\u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9\u30ef\u30a4\u30c9\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u5275\u9020\u529b\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

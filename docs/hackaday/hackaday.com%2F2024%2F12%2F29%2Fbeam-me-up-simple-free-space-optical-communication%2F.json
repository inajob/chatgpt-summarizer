Were not talking WiFi here, but plain optical signals. Free-space optical communication, or FSO, is an interesting and easy way to transmit signals through light beams. Forget expensive lasers or commercial-grade equipment; this video by [W1VLF] offers a simple and cheap entry point for anyone with a curiosity for DIY tech. Inspired by a video on weak signal sources for optical experiments, this project uses everyday components like a TV remote-control infrared LED and a photo diode. The goal is simply to establish optical communication across distances for under $10.\nClick through the break to see more\nThe heart of this setup is a basic pulse-width modulator driving the LED. Pair it with a photo diode for reception, and voil\u00e0\u2014light beams become data carriers. Add a lens for focus, and you\u2019ll instantly see the dramatic signal gain. LEDs from remote controls are surprisingly effective. For more precision, swap to narrow-beam LEDs or use filtered photo diodes to block ambient noise from sunlight or fluorescent lights. It\u2019s delightfully simple yet endlessly tweakable.\n[W1VLF]s advice: start small, but don\u2019t stop there\u2014enthusiasts have built entire FSO networks to link rural areas!

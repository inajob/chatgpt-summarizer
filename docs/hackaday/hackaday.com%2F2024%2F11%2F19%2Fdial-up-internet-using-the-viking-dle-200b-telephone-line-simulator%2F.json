Even if those who survived the dial-up years are happy to be on broadband, and those who are still on dial-up wish that they werent, theres definitely a nostalgic factor to the experience. Yet recreating the experience can be a hassle, with signing up for a dial-up ISP or jumping through many (POTS) hoops to get a dial-up server up and running. An easier way is demonstrated by [Minh Danh] with a Viking DLE-200B telephone line simulator in a recent blog post.\nThis little device does all the work of making two telephones (or modems) think that theyre communicating via a regular old POTS network. After picking up one of these puppies for a mere $5 at a flea market, [Minh Danh] tested it first with two landline phones to confirm that yes, you can call one phone from the other and hold a conversation. The next step was thus to connect two PCs via their modems, with the other side of the line receiving the call. In this case a Windows XP system was configured to be the dial-up server, passing through its internet connection via the modem.\nWith this done, a 33.6 kbps dial-up connection was successfully established on the client Windows XP system, with a blistering 3.8 kB/s download speed. The reason for 33.6 kbps is because the DLE-200B does not support 56K, and according to the manual doesnt even support higher than 28.8 kbps, so even reaching these speeds was lucky.\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3055\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u96fb\u8a71\u56de\u7dda\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- $5\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\uff01Viking DLE-200B\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- Windows XP\u3067\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u6210\u529f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

Not content with sending mixed messages about the future of the ISS amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, or attempting to hack a mothballed German space telescope back into action, Rogozin is now spouting off that the Apollo moon landings never happened. His doubts about NASAs seminal accomplishment apparently started while he was still head of Roscosmos when he tasked a group with looking into the Apollo landings. Rogozins conclusion from the data his team came back with isnt especially creative; whereas some Apollo deniers go to great lengths to find scientific proof that we were never there, Rogozin just concluded that because NASA hasnt ever repeated the feat, it must never have happened.\n\nCan your chair crash your computer? Youd think not, at least under normal use  I mean, hit a computer with a chair and itll probably crash eventually  but thats not Felix H\u00e4ckers experience. He noticed a pesky problem with his monitor, which turns off briefly when he gets in or out of his chair. His first instinct was to look for loose connections, thinking his movements were wiggling the power or data cables loose. But then he discovered similar reports from other users of the Ikea MARKUS chair, which apparently builds up enough electrostatic charge that the discharge created by getting in or out of it zaps the monitor. Its one of the weirdest failure modes weve ever heard of. And note to self: Dont use this chair at the workbench.\nDoes a USB drive change weight as you add and remove data? It seems like a silly question, but apparently, it does  just not the way you might think. Since electrons have mass  all of 9.109\u00d710\u221231 kg each  and flash memory works by storing charge, adding and removing data from a USB stick must change its weight. But interestingly, since flash memory removes the charge from the floating gate of the MOSFET to store a logical 1, that means that an empty flash drive (i.e., one storing nothing but zeros) must weigh more than a drive with nothing but ones. But by how much? Knowing that each bit in a flash memory cell holds somewhere around 100 to 1,000 electrons, a little back-of-the-envelope math shows us that a half-terabyte USB drive can vary by as much as 373 femtograms on the low end to 3.73 picograms at the upper limit. Actually measuring the weight change is left as an exercise for the reader.\nIf you manage to accomplish that task, youre probably the kind of person whod enjoy Teardown 2023. Billed as a conference for hacking, discovering, and sharing hardware, it sounds right up our collective alley. Itll be held June 23 through 25 on the campus of Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. Early-bird tickets are available now, and theres a call for proposals too. It looks like this is the first in-person Teardown since 2019, the before-times, so dont miss the chance to mix and mingle again.\nAnd finally, a few months back we gave everyone the heads up that Bill Hammack would be coming back to YouTube with more of his The Engineer Guy videos. It was exciting news at the time, and now that the videos have dropped, we can say that they were well worth the wait. They cover everything from the neolithic engineering of G\u00f6bekli Tepe to the invention of the magnetron, and he manages to tie them all together with insights into the engineering mindset. The key takeaway for me was the difference between the scientific method and the engineering method. The videos are fantastic, and I cant wait to get the accompanying book, The Things We Make. In the meantime, enjoy the videos.\n\n\n"}

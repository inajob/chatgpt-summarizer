In the news this week is the passing of Ed Smylie, the engineer who devised the famous improvised carbon dioxide filter that saved the Apollo 13 astronauts with duct tape.\nCloser to home is the announcement of the call for participation for this years Hackaday Supercon; we know you will have some ideas and projects youd like to share.\nInteresting hacks this week include a new Mac Plus motherboard and Doom (just) running on an Atari ST, while a LoRa secure messenger and an astounding open-source Ethernet switch captivated us on the hardware front. We also take a dive into the Mouse programming language, a minimalist stack-based environment from the 1970s. Among the quick hacks are a semiconductor dopant you can safely make at home, and a beautiful Mac Mini based cyberdeck.\nFinally, we wrap up with our colleague [Maya Posch] making the case for a graceful degradation of web standards, something which is now sadly missing from so much of the online world, and then with the discovery that ChatGPT can make a passable show of emulating a Hackaday scribe. Dont worry folks, were still reassuringly meat-based.\n\nInsesrt MP3 podcast link here.\n\nEpisode 322 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Supercon 2025 Call For Participation: We Want You!\nIn Memory Of Ed Smylie, Whose Famous Hack Saved The Apollo 13 Crew\n\nWhats That Sound:\n\nCongrats to [calculus] for picking up the [Jerobeam Fenderson] mushrooms.\nA Wrencher on Your Oscilloscope\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nEscaping US Tech Giants Leads European YouTuber To Open Source\nA New Mac Plus Motherboard, No Special Chips Required\n\nThe Lost 256 KB Japanese ROM For The Macintosh Plus Has Been Found\n\n\nAs The World Burns, At Least You\u2019ll Have Secure Messaging\nWorking On Open-Source High-Speed Ethernet Switch\nThe Mouse Language, Running On Arduino\n\nMUSYS.

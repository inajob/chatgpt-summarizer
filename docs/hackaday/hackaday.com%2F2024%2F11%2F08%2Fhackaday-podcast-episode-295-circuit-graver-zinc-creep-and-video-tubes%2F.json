It was a pretty good crop, too, despite all the distractions and diversions. We checked out the cutest little quadruped, a wireless antenna for wireless communications, a price-tag stand-in for paper calendars, and a neat way to test hardware and software together.\nWe take the closest look yet at why Arecibo collapsed, talk about Voyagers recent channel-switching glitch, and find out how to put old Android phones back in action. Theres smear-free solder paste application, a Mims-worthy lap counter, and a PCB engraver that youve just got to see. We wrap things up with a look at Gentoo and pay homage to the TV tubes of years gone by  the ones in the camera, for the TV sets.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the zero-calorie MP3.\n\nEpisode 295 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nVoyager 1 Fault Forces Switch To S-Band\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill in this form for your chance to win.\u00a0 Be specific!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nRapid Prototyping PCBs With The Circuit Graver\nZinc Creep And Electroplasticity: Why Arecibo Collapsed\nLittle Quadruped Has PCB Spine And No Wiring\nHardware-in-the-Loop Continuous Integration\nReusing An Old Android Phone For GPIO With External USB Devices\nPortable Solder Paste Station Prevents Smears With Suction\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nRandom Wire Antenna Uses No Wire\nPicoROM, A DIP-32 8-Bit ROM Emulator\nSplit-Flap Clock Flutters Its Way To Displaying Time Without Numbers\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nWord Of The Day Calendar Is Great Use Of E-Paper\nUse PicoGlitcher For Voltage Glitching Attacks\nClever Circuit Makes Exercise Slightly Less Boring\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nI Installed Gentoo So You Don\u2019t Havtoo\n\nHandbook:Main Page  Gentoo wiki\n\n\nCapturing Light In A Vacuum: The Magic Of Tube Video Cameras\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "Superconference 2024\u3067\u306f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002Arecibo\u5d29\u58ca\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3084\u53e4\u3044Android\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5\u3082\u8b70\u8ad6\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u611b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u56db\u8db3\u6b69\u884c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u305d\u306ePCB\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u53e4\u3044Android\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u6ce5\u68d2\u304b\u3089\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30df\u30a2\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u3093\u3060\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- \u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u7ba1\u306e\u6b74\u53f2"]}

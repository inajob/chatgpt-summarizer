(Credit: NASA)\nAlthough we tend to see mostly the glorious and fun parts of hanging out in a space station, the human body will not cease to do its usual things, whether it involves the digestive system, or even something as mundane as the hair that sprouts from our heads. After all, we do not want our astronauts to return to Earth after a half-year stay in the ISS looking as if they got marooned on an uninhabited island. Introducing the onboard barbershop on the ISS, and the engineering behind making sure that after a decade the ISS doesnt positively look like it got the 1970s shaggy wall carpet treatment.\nThe basic solution is rather straightforward: an electric hair clipper attached to a vacuum that will whisk the clippings safely into a container rather than being allowed to drift around. In a way this is similar to the vacuums you find on routers and saws in a woodworking shop, just with more keratin rather than cellulose and lignin.\nOn the Chinese Tiangong space station they use a similar approach, with the video showing how simple the system is, little more than a small handheld vacuum cleaner attached to the clippers. Naturally, you cannot just tape the vacuum cleaner to some clippers and expect it to get most of the clippings, which is where both the ISS and Tiangong solutions seems to have a carefully designed construction to maximize the hair removal. You can see the ISS system in action in this 2019 video from the Canadian Space Agency.\nOf course, this system is not perfect, but amidst the kilograms of shed skin particles from the crew, a few small hair clippings can likely be handled by the ISS air treatment systems just fine. The goal after all is to not have a massive expanding cloud of hair clippings filling up the space station.", "title": "- \u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u306a\u30d8\u30a2\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u74b0\u5883", "body": "\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u7406\u9aea\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u9aea\u306e\u6bdb\u304c\u6f02\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u306a\u30d8\u30a2\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u74b0\u5883", "- ISS\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u7406\u5bb9\u5ba4\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- \u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u30d8\u30a2\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u306e\u7f8e\u5bb9\u4e8b\u60c5", "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u3068\u771f\u7a7a\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5929\u5bae\u306b\u898b\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u3067\u306e\u30d8\u30a2\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0"]}

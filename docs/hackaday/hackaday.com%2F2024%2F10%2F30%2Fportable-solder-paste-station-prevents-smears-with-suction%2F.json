One slip of the hand, and you have a smeared mess to clean up. To make this task a little easier, [Max Scheffler] built the Stencil Fix Portable, a compact self-contained vacuum table to hold your stencil firmly in place and pop it off cleanly every time.\nThe Stencil Fix V1 used a shop vac for suction, just like another stencil holder weve seen. The vacuum can take up precious space, makes the jig a little tricky to move, and bumping the hose can lead to the dreaded smear and colorful language. To get around this [Max] added a brushless drone motor with a 3D printed impeller, with a LiPo battery for power. The speed controller gets its PWM signal from a little RP2040 dev board connected to a potentiometer. [Max] could have used a servo tester, but he found the motor could be a little too responsive and would move the entire unit due to inertia from the impeller. The RP2040 allowed him to add a low pass filter to eliminate the issue. The adjustable speed also means the suction force can be reduced a little for easy alignment of the stencil before locking it down completely.\nWe love seeing tool projects like these that make future projects a little easier. Fortunately, [Max] made the designs available so you can build your own.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u56fa\u5b9a\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u771f\u7a7a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044PCB\u7528\u306b\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u3092\u56fa\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u300cStencil Fix Portable\u300d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u6383\u9664\u306e\u624b\u9593\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u56fa\u5b9a\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u771f\u7a7a\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb", "- \u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c0\u4ed8\u3051\u3092\u697d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc", "- RP2040\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u56fa\u5b9a\u5177", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u56fa\u5b9a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u516c\u958b"]}

It often leaves you running to the /? or help switches, or else a quick Google search to find the proper incantations. Shell-AI is a machine-learning assistant that could change all that by helping you find the proper command for the job, right on the command line!\nShell-AI accepts natural-language inputs  simply type in shai followed by what youre trying to do. It will then take in your request, run it through an OpenAI language model like GPT-3.5-Turbo, and then present you with three (or more) potential commands. You can then select which command to use and get on with your day.\nAs demonstrated, its more than capable of following commands like download a random image or show only image files ls. And, hilariously, it responds to the request do something crazy with just one suggestion: rm -rf. That seems rather fitting.\nWe wouldnt blindly follow any commands coming out of a large language model, of course. But, if you know what youre doing, it could prove a useful little tool to ease your regular duties on the command line."}

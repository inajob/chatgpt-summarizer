Sometimes its something that you could put to work immediately, like an old computer or some scrap piece of material thats just the right size. But other times, you find something on the side of the road that ends up being the impetus for a whole new project.\nFor [David Bertet], finding a beat up kids Jeep Wrangler on the curb was the first step towards a journey that ends with PowerJeep: an open source project that we wager could end up saving similar vehicles from the landfill. The basic idea is simple enough  strip out the vehicles original 12 volt power supply and replace it with 18 V provided by easily swappable tool batteries. But as is often the case, its the details and the documentation that sets this project apart.\n\nJust hacking an 18 V battery into the existing wiring and controls would probably have provided a few minutes worth of destructive fun, but not much else. So [David] approached things a bit more methodically; by adding a proper motor controller and dumping the original momentary switch throttle pedal for an analog version, the upgraded power from the new batteries could be properly harnessed. The addition of 12 and 3 volt regulators means the vehicles remaining stock electronics and accessories can be powered without letting the Magic Smoke out.\nBut perhaps the most exciting part of the PowerJeep project is the ESP32 thats been added into the mix. While this project could certainly have been completed with dumb electronics, putting the WiFi-enabled microcontroller between the driver and the motor controller allows [David] to do things like adjust the vehicles maximum speed depending on whether his younger or older child is behind the wheel. Hes also able to monitor the systems vital statistics on his phone through a slick web interface, and should the need ever arise, he can tap the big red Emergency Stop button to cut power in an instant.\nFor those looking to upgrade their kids ride, [David] has provided source code for the ESP32, a parts list, a wiring diagram, and even the 3D models for the few parts that needed to be printed. Naturally theres going to be a lot of variations on this basic premise depending on which particular kiddie car youve got, but this project should still get you most of the way there.\nIf youre looking to put even more high-tech goodies into your build, you might want to take a look at the clever traction control system we saw added to a lil Lambo back in 2019. You could even upgrade the frame and slip into the drivers seat yourself, if you dare.", "title": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308bPowerJeep\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6e08\u307f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3057\u3001\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u30b8\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u309218V\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3002ESP32\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u6700\u5927\u901f\u5ea6\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3084\u7dca\u6025\u505c\u6b62\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3002\u5236\u5fa1\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3002\u8981\u70b9\u306f\u5145\u5b9f\u3057\u305f\u6587\u66f8\u5316\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308bPowerJeep\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "18V\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u8eca\u4e21\u3078\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u5909\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "ESP32\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u5b50\u4f9b\u7528\u8eca\u4e21PowerJeep\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u5236\u5fa1\uff01PowerJeep\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff01ESP32\u642d\u8f09PowerJeep\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

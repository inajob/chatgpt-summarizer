He had an Onkyo AV receiver that did a great job until it didnt. A DSP inside failed. When that happened, the main microprocessor running the show decided it wouldnt play ball without the DSP operational. [Bill] knew the bulk of the audio hardware was still good, it was just the brains that were faulty. Thus started a 4-month operation to resurrect the Onkyo receiver with new intelligence instead.\n[Bills] concept was simple. Yank the dead DSP, and the useless microprocessor as well. In their place, an ESP32 would be tasked with running things. [Bill] no longer cared if the receiver had DSP abilities or even the ability to pass video\u2014he just wanted to use it as the quality audio receiver that it was.\nHis project report steps through all the hard work he went through to get things operational again. He had to teach the ESP32 to talk to the front panel display, the keys, and the radio tuner. More challenging was the core audio processor\u2014the obscure Renaisys R2A15218FP. However, by persevering, [Bill] was able to get everything up and running, and even added some new functionality\u2014including Internet radio and Bluetooth streaming.\nIts a heck of a build, and [Bill] ended up with an even more functional audio receiver at the end of it all. Bravo, we say.\u00a0We love to see older audio gear brought back to life, particularly in creative ways.

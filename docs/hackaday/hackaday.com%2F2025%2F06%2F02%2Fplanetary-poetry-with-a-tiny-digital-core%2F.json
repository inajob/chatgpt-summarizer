They\u2019re, for a change, not overly engineered; theyre just elegant, anachronistic, and full of mischief. That\u2019s exactly what [Frans] pulls off with A Gentleman\u2019s Orrery, a tiny, simple clockwork solar system. Composed of shiny brass and the poise of 18th-century craftsmanship, it hides a modern secret: theres barely any clockwork inside. You can build it yourself.\nPeek behind the polished face and you\u2019ll find a mechanical sleight of hand. This isnt your grandfather\u2019s gear-laden planetarium. Instead of that, it operates on a pared-down system that relies on a stepper motor, driving planetary movement through a 0.8\u202fmm axle nested inside a 1\u202fmm brass tube. That micro-mechanical coupling, aided by a couple of bevel gears, manages to rotate the Moon just right, including its orientation. Most of the movement relies on clever design, not gear cascades. The real wizardry happens under the hood: a 3D-printed chassis cradles an ESP32-C6, a TTP223 capacitive touch module, STSPIN220 driver, and even a reed switch with magnetic charging.\nYou can even swap out the brass for a stone shell where the full moon acts as the touch control. It\u2019s tactile, it\u2019s poetic, and therefore, a nice hack for a weekend project. To build it yourself, read [Frans] Instructable.\n\n"}

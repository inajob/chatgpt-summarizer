After all, off-the-shelf solutions are focused on hearing protection, not sound quality. [Pete] also wanted features like the ability to freely adjust how much ambient sound was mixed in, as well as the ability to integrate a line-level audio source or Bluetooth input.\nEarly prototype of Super Headphones (click to enlarge)\nOn the surface the required components are straightforward, but as usual, the devil is in the details. Microphone selection, for example, required a lot of testing. A good microphone needed to be able to deal with extremely loud ambient sounds without distortion, yet still be sensitive enough to be useful. [Pete] found a good solution, but also muses that two sets of microphones (one for loud environments, and one for quieter) might be worth a try.\nAfter several prototypes, the result is headphones that allow safe and loud band practice in a basement as easily as they provide high-quality music and situational awareness while mowing the lawn. Even so, [Pete]s not done yet. Hes working on improving comfort by using photogrammetry to help design and 3D print custom-fitted components.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305fSuper\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "SparkFun\u306ePete Lewis\u3055\u3093\u304c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u54c1\u8cea\u97f3\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u900f\u904e\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9694\u96e2\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8074\u899a\u4fdd\u8b77\u3082\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u65e2\u88fd\u54c1\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001DIY\u306e\u307b\u3046\u304c\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u304d\u308b\u305f\u3081\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3082\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u5feb\u9069\u3055\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u4f5c\u6210\u3082\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305fSuper\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u74b0\u5883\u304b\u3089\u9694\u96e2\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30a4\u30af\u30aa\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306a\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u6cd5", "\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3084Bluetooth\u5165\u529b\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u305fSuper\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\uff1a\u8033\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77\u3068\u97f3\u8cea\u306e\u4e21\u7acb", "\u5feb\u9069\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u5199\u771f\u6e2c\u91cf\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30db\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u767a"]}

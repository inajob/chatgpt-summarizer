[Venn] from the [interfacinglinux.com] blog tells us about their journey bringing up UEFI on this board, thanks to the [EDK2-RK3588] project. Why? UEFI is genuinely nice for things like OS switching or system reconfiguration on the fly, and in many aspects, having a system management/configuration interface for your SBC sure beats the flash microSD card and pray traditional approach.\nIn theory, a UEFI binary runs like any other firmware. In theory. For [Venn], the journey wasnt as smooth, which made it very well worth documenting. Theres maybe not a mountain, but at least a small hill of caveats: having to use a specific HDMI port to see the configuration output, somehow having to flash it onto SPI flash chip specifically (and managing to do that through Gnome file manager of all things), requiring a new enough kernel for GPU hardware acceleration Yet, it works, it really does.\nWorth it? From the looks of it, absolutely. One thing [Venn] points out is, the RK3588 is getting a lot of its features upstreamed, so its aiming to become a healthy chip for many a Linux goal. From the blog post comments, weve also learned that theres a RPi UEFI port, even if for a specific CPU revision of the Model 5B, its still a nifty thing to know. Want to learn more about UEFI?

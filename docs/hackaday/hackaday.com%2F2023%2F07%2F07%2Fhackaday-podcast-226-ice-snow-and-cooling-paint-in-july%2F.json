We start off with some fond remembrances of Don Lancaster, a legendary hardware hacker who passed away last month. Theres also news about the Hackaday Prize (the tool competition) and a rant about fast computers and slow software, a topic that drew many comments this week.\nIn the Whats That Sound event, Al proves hes more of a Star Trek fan than a videogamer. But there were plenty of correct answers, but only one winner: []. Theres always next week, so keep playing!\nElliot may be dreaming of cooler weather since he talks about ice sculptures, snow measurements, and a paint that can make things cooler. We dont know what Al is dreaming about, but he is worried about his fuses, and the ins and out of open source licensing.\nAlong the way, youll hear about personal vehicles, sky cameras, and zapping weeds with extreme solar power. As usual, there is an eclectic mix of other posts. What has the Hackaday crew been up to? Field trips! Hear about Dan Maloneys visit to the SNOTEL network to measure snowfall and a report from Al and Bil Herds trip to the Vintage Computer Festival Southwest.\nWhat to read along? The links below will get you started. Dont forget to tell us what you think in the comments!\n\nOr, download a copy for posterity to file away in your archive.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\n\nEpisode 226 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nSaying Goodbye to Don Lancaster\nComputer Speed Gains Erased by Modern Software\nGearing Up with the 2023 Hackaday Prize\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Wybrandus] for guessing Qbert (and getting lucky).\n[Elliot] stands corrected!\u00a0 The voice synth in Qbert wasnt a TI at all!\u00a0 It was a Votrax.

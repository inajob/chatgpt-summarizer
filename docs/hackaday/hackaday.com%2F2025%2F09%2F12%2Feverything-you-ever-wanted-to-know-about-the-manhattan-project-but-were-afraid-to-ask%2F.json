Most of them dont have a lot of technical substance, though. You know  military finds genius, genius recruits other geniuses, bomb! But if you want to hear the story of the engineering, [Brian Potter] tells it all. We mean, like, all of it.\nIf youre looking for a quick three-minute read, youll want to give this a pass. Save it for a rainy afternoon when you can settle in. Even then, he skips past a lot of what is well known. Instead, he spends quite a bit of time discussing how the project addressed the technical challenges, like separating out U235.\nFour methods were considered for that task. Creating sufficient amounts of plutonium was also a problem. Producing a pound of plutonium took 4,000 pounds of uranium. When you had enough material, there was the added problem of getting it together fast enough to explode instead of just having a radioactive fizzle.\nThere are some fascinating tidbits in the write-up. For example, building what would become the Oak Ridge facility required conductors for electromagnets. Copper, however, was in short supply. It was wartime, after all. So the program borrowed another good conductor, silver, from the Treasury Department. Presumably, they eventually returned it, but [Brian] doesnt say.\nTheres the old story that they werent entirely sure they wouldnt ignite the entire atmosphere but, of course, they didnt.\u00a0 Not that the nuclear program didnt have its share of bad luck.", "title": "\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u88cf\u5074\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "body": "\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8ab2\u984c\u3078\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u8a73\u8ff0\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u8a08\u753b\u306e\u88cf\u5074\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u6838\u7206\u5f3e\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\uff1a\u30d7\u30eb\u30c8\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u3068\u30a6\u30e9\u30f3\u306e\u5206\u96e2", "\u6226\u6642\u4e2d\u306e\u8cc7\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u8a08\u753b\u3068\u96fb\u78c1\u77f3", "\u6838\u958b\u767a\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\uff1a\u5927\u6c17\u70b9\u706b\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30dd\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30de\u30f3\u30cf\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30"]}

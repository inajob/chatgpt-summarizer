Its a great way to get familiar with electronics and (often) microcontrollers, and you get to express some creativity along the way. Plus, you get something useful when youre done! [Tadas Ustinavi\u010dius] recently trod this well-worn path and built a neat little NTP clock of their own.\nThe build uses an ESP 12F as the core of the operation. Its charged with querying an NTP time server via its WiFi connection in order to maintain accurate timekeeping around the clock. For display, it drives a series of custom 7-segment displays that [Tadas] built using 3D-printed housings. They use WS2812B addressable LEDs and thus can display a rainbow of colors.\nFor initial configuration, the phone creates its own WiFi hotspot with a web interface for changing settings. Once configured, it connects to the Internet over WiFi to query an NTP server at regular intervals.\nIts a simple build that does a simple job well. Projects like these can be very valuable, as they teach you all kinds of useful skills. If youve been working on your own clock design, dont hesitate to let us know. You can use a microcontroller, relays, or even a ball."}

Want the look but dont have a hundred grand to spare? [Every Project All at Once] has got a Nautalis-inspired design on printables you can run off for pennies. He also provides a tutorial video (embedded below) so you can follow along with his design process and get build instructions.\nThe model was done in Blender, and is designed to contain a 3.5 full-range driver by Dayton Audio  a considerable simplification from the array of woofers and tweeters in the original Nautalis. On the other hand, they cost considerably less than a car and have no production wait list. [Every Project All At Once] is apparently working on a matching woofer if that interests you, but unless he invests in a bigger printer it seems we can safely say that would require more assembly than this project.\nOf course it would also be possible to copy BWs design directly, rather than print a loose inspiration of it as makers such as [Every Project All At Once] have done, but whats the fun in that? Its a much more interesting hack to take an idea and make it your own, as was done here, and then you can share the design without worrying about a luxury brands legal team.\nDesktop 3D printing offers a\u00a0wealth of possibilities for would-be speaker makers, including the possibility of rolling your own drivers.\n\n", "title": "- BW\u30ca\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u5236\u4f5c", "body": "BW Nautalis\u3092\u6a21\u3057\u305f\u683c\u5b89\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u767b\u5834\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u3067\u3001\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u7c21\u5358\u3002", "titles": ["- BW\u30ca\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u5236\u4f5c", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ca\u30bf\u30ea\u30b9\u98a8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- Blender\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d73D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

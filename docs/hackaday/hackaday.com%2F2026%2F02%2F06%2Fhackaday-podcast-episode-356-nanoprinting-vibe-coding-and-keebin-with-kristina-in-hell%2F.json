What is she running now? What does she miss about Windows? Tune in to find out.\nOn Whats That Sound, Kristina thought it was a jackhammer, but [Statistically Unlikely] knew it was ground-tamper thingy, and won a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt! Congratulations!\nAfter that, its on to the hacks and such, beginning with 3D printing on the nano scale, and a couple of typewriter-based hacks.\u00a0 Then we take a look at the beauty of the math behind graph theory, especially when it comes to circuit sculptures and neckties.\nWe also talk display hacking, macro pads with haptic feedback knobs, and writing code in Welsh. Finally, we discuss the Virtual Boy, and ponder whether vibe coding is killing open source.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 356 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nNo news is good news, except that Kristina ditched Windows after ~38 years!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Statistically Unlikely] who knew this was an Earth-stomping machine!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nThe Latest From RepRapMicron \u2013 Nail Gel, First Objects, And More\nLego Typewriter Writes Plastic Letters\nComprehensive Power Management For The Raspberry Pi\nCrouching Typewriter, Hidden PC\nThe Graph Theory Of Circuit Sculptures\n\nThe 85 Ways to Tie a Tie\nThe Mathematics of Tie Knots\n\n\nDIY Macropad Rocks A Haptic Feedback Wheel\n\nSimplifying The SmartKnob\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\n5K IMac Turned Into 5K Display\nCPU Scheduler Divines The Will Of The Heavens\nAn Event Badge Re-Imagined As A Cyberdeck\nYsgrifennu C\u00f4d Yn Gymraeg (Writing Code In Welsh)\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\nOrdering Pizza On Your Sega Dreamcast Is Very Clunky Indeed\nNeed A Curved Plastic Mesh?

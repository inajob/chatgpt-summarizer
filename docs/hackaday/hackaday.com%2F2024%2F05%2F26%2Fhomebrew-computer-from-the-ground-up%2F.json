Others go even further back, to the time of the Intel 8008 or earlier, and a dedicated few will build something completely novel. This project from [3DSage] falls squarely in the latter category, with his completely DIY computer built component by component from scratch, including the machine code needed to run it.\n[3DSage] starts with the backbone of every computer: the clock. He first demonstrates how a pair of NOT gates with a set of capacitors can be used as a rudimentary clock pulse, then builds a more refined version with a 555 timer and potentiometer for adjustable rates. Then, its on to creating a binary counter, which is a fundamental part of the memory system for this small computer, and finally, allows this circuitry to behave like a normal computer. Using a set of switches to store values in memory and stepping through them with the clock, the computer can be programmed to do plenty of tasks just like a modern microcontroller.\n[3DSage] built this project a few years ago and has used it for real-world applications such as controlling servos, LED arrays, playing music, and other tasks. Although he has to program it using his own machine code by hand, its a usable computer in many ways. If you want to eschew modernity and build a retro computer in the style of the 1960s, though, this piece goes through what it would have been like to build a similar system in the era when these computers were more common. If you have a switch fetish, you might like to see how real computers worked back then, too.\n\n", "title": "DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u901a\u904e\u5100\u793c\u3067\u3059\u3002[3DSage]\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb\u306aDIY\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u3084LED\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u307f", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u8a18\u9332"]}

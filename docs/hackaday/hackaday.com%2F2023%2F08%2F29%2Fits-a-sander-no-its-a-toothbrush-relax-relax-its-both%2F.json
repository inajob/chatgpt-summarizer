[Modelkitsdeluxe] fits the bill by modifying a power toothbrush into a miniature sander. If you want to practice your Spanish, you can watch the video below. Or you can try the automatically translated captions.\nAs you can guess from the user name, he is mainly interested in working with small models, but it struck us that this might also be useful for general 3D printing. Honestly, once you have the idea, there isnt much to it. You mutilate a brush head that fits the toothbrush to accept a small sanding disk.\nThere are probably a dozen ways to attach your sandpaper or emery cloth to the head. [Modelkitdeluxe] used double-sided tape and Velcro. While we applaud the upcycling, well probably stick with a hobby tool. Our toothbrush makes an annoying buzz every 30 seconds or so to remind you to move to another part of your mouth. That doesnt seem like a great feature when doing precision sanding. On the other hand, you could probably yank the controller out of the toothbrush and use it for the motor, drive, and batteries to avoid that.\nIf you want to tackle that, heres something to get you started. If sanding doesnt turn your crank, maybe you can try turning your deadbolt.\n\n", "title": "\"\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\"", "body": "\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9762\u767d\u304f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002\u7814\u78e8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u3042\u308b\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5916\u90e8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\"", "\"3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3082\u5fdc\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u5de5\u5177\"", "\"\u7cbe\u5bc6\u7814\u78e8\u306b\u6700\u9069\uff01\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7814\u78e8\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\"", "\"\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\uff01\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u5de5\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\"", "\"\u96fb\u52d5\u6b6f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\""]}

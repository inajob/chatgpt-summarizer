In out line, weve seen this with CAD packages and notably with EAGLE PCB CAD, but its hit other sectors in exactly the same way. The art and design communities, in particular, are feeling the pinch from Adobe Suite going towards a rental model, and now the artist and perennial thorn in the side of anyone who seeks to own a colour, [Stuart Semple] is doing something about it. Hes launching a competing suite called provocatively, Abode, which will follow an affordable paid-for licence model. Its a development that raises interesting questions for the open source community, so its definitely worth a second look from that perspective.\nTaking on software rental can only be a good thing, and we hope that the new package gains a foothold for that reason. But since were sure that there will be open-source enthusiasts asking the question: why are the established open-source equivalents such as GIMP and Inkscape not the obvious alternatives to the Adobe suite? In there may be some uncomfortable moments of soul searching for the software libre world around usability and interfaces.\nWhatever your take on open source versus paid software, its extremely encouraging to have somebody mount a high-profile challenge to the software rental model. We hope that Abode makes it to market and that it succeeds in making the graphics software market a little more open. Meanwhile, weve mentioned [Stuart Semple] before for his colour activism over the blackest of blacks, and for previously taking on Adobe over Pantone pricing.", "title": "\u300c\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8cfc\u5165\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u65b0\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8 Abode \u306e\u767b\u5834\u300d", "body": "\u6709\u6599\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u3084\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u304c\u61f8\u5ff5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30bb\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u6c0f\u304c\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u6709\u6599\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3001Abode\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7af6\u5408\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u554f\u984c\u3082\u8d77\u3053\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3060\u3002\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226\u306f\u5927\u3044\u306b\u6b53\u8fce\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8cfc\u5165\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u65b0\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8 Abode \u306e\u767b\u5834\u300d", "\u300cCAD\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u7d9a\u304f\u3001Abode\u304c\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u554f\u3044\u304b\u3051\u3092\u63d0\u8d77\u300d", "\u300c\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u696d\u754c\u306b\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\uff01 Abode\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3068\u306a\u308b\u300d", "\u300c\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u306b\u9769\u547d\uff01 Abode\u304c\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u6709\u511f\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3067\u767b\u5834\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u754c\u306b\u554f\u3044\u304b\u3051\u3001Abode\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u308b\u300d"]}

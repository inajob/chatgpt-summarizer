Others however are fully in touch with their Inner Cat, and venture forth frequently in search of whatever prey they can find.\n[Rkramer] has a cat of this nature,sadly one with a propensity for returning with live prey. To avoid this problem a solution is called for, and it comes in the shape of the Cat Valve, an automated cat door which enforces a buffer zone in their cellar to prevent unwanted gifts.\nIts a simple enough idea, when an IR sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 detects the cat heading out into the world through the exterior cat flap, the computer fires up a motor connected to a lead screw which closes the flap between buffer zone and house. The cat then has the safety of the buffer zone, but cant bring the prey fully inside.\nIf youre a cat lover youll forgive them anything, but we have to admit to being on [Rkramer]s side with this one. A useful way to keep the prey at bay is something we could have used a few times in the past, too. This project is part of the 2025 Pet Hacks contest. Done something similar for your cat? Why not make it an entry!\n \n\n", "title": "- \u732b\u306e\u72e9\u308a\u3092\u9632\u3050\uff01\u81ea\u52d5\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u300c\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u732b\u30c9\u30a2\u300cCat Valve\u300d\u306f\u3001\u732b\u306e\u6355\u7372\u7269\u3092\u5bb6\u306b\u6301\u3061\u8fbc\u307e\u305b\u306a\u3044\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u732b\u306e\u72e9\u308a\u3092\u9632\u3050\uff01\u81ea\u52d5\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u300c\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u732b\u7528\u30d0\u30c3\u30d5\u30a1\u30be\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5236\u4f5c", "- \u732b\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u751f\u304d\u305f\u7372\u7269\u3092\u6301\u3061\u5e30\u3089\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- 2025\u5e74\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u81ea\u52d5\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30c9\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5ba4\u5185\u3067\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u904a\u3076\u732b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

And if youre like us, you were sure that Webb had already achieved the first direct imaging of a planet orbiting a star other than our own a long time ago. But as it turns out, Webb has only recently knocked that item off its bucket list, with the direct visualization of a Saturn-like planet orbiting a nearby star known somewhat antiseptically as TWA 7, about 111 light-years away in the constellation Antlia. The star has a significant disk of debris orbiting around it, and using the coronagraph on Webbs MIRI instrument, astronomers were able to blot out the glare of the star and collect data from just the dust. This revealed a faint infrared source near the star that appeared to be clearing a path through the dust.\n\nThe planet, dubbed TWA 7b, orbits its star at about 50 times the distance from Earth to the Sun and is approximately the size of Saturn, but only a third of its mass. The star itself is only about 6.4 million years old, so the planet may still be accreting from the debris disk, which might present interesting insights into planetary formation, assuming that other astronomers confirm that TWA 7b is indeed a planet. But whats really interesting about this discovery is that because the star systems orbital plane appears to be more or less perpendicular to ours, the standard exoplanet detection method based on measuring the dimming of the star by planets passing between it and us wouldnt have worked. This might open the doors to the discovery of many more exoplanets, and thats pretty exciting.\nQuestion: Whats worse than a big space rock thats on a collision course with Earth? Answer: Honestly, it feels like a lot of things would be worse than that right now. But if your goal is planetary protection, one possible answer is doing something that turns the one big rock into a lot of little rocks. That seems to be just what NASAs DART mission did when it smashed into a bit of space debris named Dimorphos back in 2022, ejecting over 100 boulders from the asteroid-orbiting moonlet. LICIAcube, an Italian cubesat that hitched a ride on DART, used optical cameras to observe the ejecta, and measured rocks from 0.2 m to 3.6 m in diameter as they yeeted off at up to 52 meters per second. Rather than spreading out randomly, the boulders clustered into two different groups, something that years of playing Asteroids has taught us isnt what youd expect. The whole thing just goes to show that planetary protection isnt as simple as blasting into a killer asteroid and hoping for the best. And please, can somebody out there type NASA DART into Google and tell me what they see? Because if its not an animated spacecraft zipping across the screen and knocking the window out of kilter, then I need a vacation. K, thanks.\nDo you even code? If youre reading Hackaday, chances are good that you at least know enough coding to get yourself into trouble. But if you dont, or you want to ruin somebody elses life bring someone new into the wonderful world of bossing computers around, take a look at Micro Adventure, an online adventure game aimed at teaching you the basics  err, BASICs  of coding. The game walks you through a text-based RPG (Youre in a dark room) and prompts you to code your way through to a solution. The game has an emulator window that appears to be based on MS/DOS 1.00, so you know its cutting-edge stuff. To be fair, its always been our experience that coding is mostly about concepts, and once you learn what a loop is or how to branch in one language, figuring it out in another language is just about syntax. There seem to be at least six different adventures planned, so perhaps other languages will make an appearance in the future.\nAnd finally, while were talking about the gamification of nerd education, if youve been meaning to learn Morse code, you might want to check out Morse Code Defender. Its an Android app that uses a Missile Command motif to help you learn Morse, with attacking missiles having a character attached to them, and you having to enter the correct Morse code to blow the missile up before it takes out your ham shack. We havent tried it yet, so there may be more to it, but it sure seems like a cute way to gamify the Morse learning process. Honestly, its got to be better than doomscrolling Instagram.", "title": "\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30d6\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066\u76f4\u63a5\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u305f\u7cfb\u5916\u60d1\u661fTWA 7b\u306e\u767a\u898b", "body": "\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30d6\u5b87\u5b99\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u304c\u3001TWA 7\u3068\u3044\u3046\u661f\u306e\u5468\u308a\u3092\u56de\u308b\u60d1\u661f\u3092\u76f4\u63a5\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u767a\u898b\u306f\u3001\u60d1\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u306e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30d6\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u304c\u521d\u3081\u3066\u76f4\u63a5\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u305f\u7cfb\u5916\u60d1\u661fTWA 7b\u306e\u767a\u898b", "NASA\u306eDART\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5c0f\u60d1\u661f\u3092\u7834\u58ca\u3057\u3001\u60d1\u661f\u4fdd\u8b77\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9053\u3092\u62d3\u304f", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u300cMicro Adventure\u300d\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u5b66\u3076\u305f\u3081\u306e\u300cMorse Code Defender\u300d\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30d6\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u6210\u679c\u304c\u7cfb\u5916\u60d1\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u793a\u5506"]}

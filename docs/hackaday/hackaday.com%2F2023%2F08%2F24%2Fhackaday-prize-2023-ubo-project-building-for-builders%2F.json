Gadgets like the Sonos speakers and Amazon or Googles covert listening devices (aka Echo, Alexa, or whatever theyre branded as) are fun to play with. Still, the difficulty of hacking custom applications into them and god-forbid adding ones own extension hardware, makes them fairly closed ecosystems. Add in the concerns of privacy and data security; they look less and less attractive the closer you look. Luckily the Raspberry Pi and its friends have improved the accessibility to the point where its positively easy to create whatever you want with whatever hardware you need, and to that end we think [Mehrdad] has done a splendid job.\nThe custom top PCB sits below the wooden top surface, hosting a central LCD display with push buttons located around it. Also sitting atop are some IR transmitters and receivers as well as RGB LEDs for the ring lighting. This top PCB acts as a RPi hat, and plugs into an RPi4 below, which then attaches to a side board via some PCB-mounted connectors, matching up with the USB and audio connectors. This board seems to act purely as an interconnect and form-factor adaptor allowing interfaces to be presented more conveniently without needing wires. This makes for a very clean construction. Extensive use of resin printing is shown, with lots of nice details of how to solve problems such as LED diffusion and bleeding. Overall, a very slick and well-executed project, that is giving us a few ideas for our own projects.\nThis type of project is commonplace on these fair pages, like this DIY smart speaker for example. With the supply of pi being still a little difficult to deal with, could you roll your own or get an alternative? What about just using your old mobile phone?\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3001Ubo Pod", "body": "\"Raspberry Pi 4\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3001Sonos\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3084Amazon\u3001Google\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002\"", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3001Ubo Pod", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7af6\u5408\u4ed6\u793e\u3068\u5339\u6575\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\uff01\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u62e1\u5f35\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3001Ubo Pod", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u914d\u616e\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3001Ubo Pod", "\u9ad8\u3044\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b7\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3067\u81ea\u5728\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u69cb\u7bc9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\uff01\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306eUbo Pod", "\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\uff01\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a44\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3001Ubo Pod"]}

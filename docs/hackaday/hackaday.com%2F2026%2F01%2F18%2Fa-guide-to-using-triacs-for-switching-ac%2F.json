Relays are fundamental, proven technologies to safely switch all kinds of loads. They do have their downsides, though, so if you need silent operation, precise timing, or the ability to operate orders of magnitude more times you might want to look at a triac instead. These solid state devices can switch AC loads unlike other transistor-based devices and [Ray] at OpenSprinkler is here to give us an overview on how to use them.\nThe key to switching an AC load is bi-directional conductivity. A normal transistor or diode can only conduct in one direction, so if you try to switch an AC load with one of these youll end up with what essentially amounts to a bad rectifier. Triacs do have a gate analogous to the base of a bipolar junction transistor, but the gate will trigger the triac when current flows in either direction as well. The amount of current needed to trigger the triac does depend on the state of the switched waveform, so it can be more complex to configure than a relay or transistor in some situations.\nAfter going through some of the theory around these devices, [Ray] demonstrates how to use them with an irrigation system, which are almost always operating on a 24VAC system thanks to various historical quirks. This involves providing the triacs with a low voltage source to provide gate current as well as a few other steps. But with that out of the way, switching AC loads with triacs can become second nature. If you prefer a DC setup for your sprinklers, though, [vinthewrench] has demonstrated how to convert these sprinkler systems instead.", "title": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAC\u8ca0\u8377\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u9580", "body": "\u9ad8\u51fa\u529b\u306eAC\u8ca0\u8377\u3092\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066\u9759\u97f3\u64cd\u4f5c\u306b\u9069\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAC\u8ca0\u8377\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u9580", "\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u3068\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8ca0\u8377\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u9759\u97f3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3088\u308b\u704c\u6f11\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "AC\u8ca0\u8377\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7406\u8ad6\u3068\u5b9f\u8df5\uff1a\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u89e3\u8aac"]}

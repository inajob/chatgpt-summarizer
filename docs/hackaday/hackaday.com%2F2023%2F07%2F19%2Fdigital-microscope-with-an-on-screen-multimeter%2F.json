Others are more odd pairings, like bananas and bacon. We arent sure which category to put [IMSAI Guy]s latest find in. He has a microscope with a built-in digital multimeter. You can see the video of the device in operation below.\nThe microscope itself is one of those unremarkable ten-inch LCD screens with some lights and a USB camera. But it also has jacks for test probes, and the display shows up in the corner of the screen. It is a normal enough digital meter except for the fact that its display is on the screen.\nIf you had to document test results, this might be just the ticket. If you are probing tiny little SMD parts under the scope, you may find it useful, too, so you dont have to look away from what you are working on when you want to take a measurement. Although for that, you could probably just have a normal display in the bezel, and it would be just as useful.\nAt about $180 USD, its not exactly an impulse buy. We wonder if well someday see an oscilloscope microscope. That might be something. These cheap microscopes are often just webcams with additional optics. You can do the same thing with your phone. If you dont need the microscope, but you like the idea, can we interest you in a heads-up meter?\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4ed8\u304d\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3068\u52d5\u4f5c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa", "body": "\u300cIMSAI Guy\u300d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u5185\u8535\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u6587\u66f8\u5316\u3084\u3001\u4f5c\u696d\u4e2d\u306b\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3092\u884c\u3046\u5834\u5408\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\u7d04180\u30c9\u30eb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u4ed8\u304d\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3068\u52d5\u4f5c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u30d3\u30eb\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u4fa1\u683c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u5185\u306e\u8868\u793a\u3067\u6e2c\u5b9a\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "180\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

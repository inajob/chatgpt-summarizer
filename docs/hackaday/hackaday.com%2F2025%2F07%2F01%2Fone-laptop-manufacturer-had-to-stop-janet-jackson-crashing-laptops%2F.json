The Pied Piper, for example, or the infamous brown note.\nBut what about a song that could crash your laptop just by playing it? Even better, a song that could crash nearby laptops in the vicinity, too? Its not magic, and its not a trick\u2014it was just a punchy pop song that Janet Jackson wrote back in 1989.\n\nRhythm Nation\nAs told by Microsofts Raymond Chen, the story begins in the early 2000s during the Windows XP era. Engineers at a certain OEM laptop manufacturer noticed something peculiar. Playing Janet Jacksons song Rhythm Nation through laptop speakers would cause the machines to crash. Even more bizarrely, the song could crash nearby laptops that werent even playing the track themselves, and the effect was noted across laptops of multiple manufacturers.\n\nRhythm Nation was a popular song from Jacksons catalog, but nothing about it immediately stands out as a laptop killer.\u00a0\nAfter extensive testing and process of elimination, the culprit was identified as the audio frequencies within the song itself. It came down to the hardware of the early 2000s laptops in question. These machines relied on good old mechanical hard drives. Specifically, they used 2.5-inch 5,400 RPM drives with spinning platters, magnetic heads, and actuator arms.\nThe story revolves around 5,400 RPM laptop hard drives, but the manufacturer and model are not public knowledge. No reports have been made of desktop PCs or hard disks suffering the same issue.

Investigation determined that something in Rhythm Nation was hitting a resonant frequency of some component of the drive. When this occurred, the drive would be disturbed enough that read errors would stack up to the point where it would trigger a crash in the operating system. The problem wasnt bad enough to crash the actual hard drive head into the platters themselves, which would have created major data loss. It was just bad enough to disrupt the hard drives ability to read properly, to the point where it could trigger a crash in the operating system.\nA research paper published in 2018 investigated the vibrational characteristics of a certain model of 2.5-inch laptop hard drive. Its not conclusive evidence, and has nothing to do with the Janet Jackson case, but it provides some potentially interesting insights as to why similar hard drives failed to read when the song was played.

Allegedly, the OEM simply whipped up a notch filter for the audio subsystem to remove the offending frequencies. The filter apparently remained in place from the then-contemporary Windows XP up until at least Windows 7. At this point, Microsoft created a new rule for Audio Processing Objects (APO) which included things like the special notch filter. The rule stated that all of these filters must be able to be switched off if so desired by the user. However, the story goes that the manufacturer gained a special exception for some time to leave their filter APO on at all times, to prevent users disabling it and then despairing when their laptops suddenly started crashing unexpectedly during Janet Jackson playlists.\nAs for what made Rhythm Nation special? YouTuber Adam Neely investigated, and came up with a compelling theory. Having read a research paper on the vibrational behavior of a 2.5-inch 5,400 RPM laptop hard disk, he found that it reported the drive to have its largest vibrational peak at approximately 87.5 Hz.\u00a0 Meanwhile, he also found that Rhythm Nation\u00a0had a great deal of energy at 84.2 Hz. Apparently, the recording had been sped up a touch after the recording process, pushing the usual low E at 82 Hz up slightly higher. The theory being that the mild uptuning in Rhythm Nation\u00a0pushed parts of the song close enough to the resonant frequency of some of the hard drives components to give them a good old shaking, causing the read errors and eventual crashes.\nIts an interesting confluence of unintended consequences. A singular pop song from 1989 ended up crashing laptops over a decade later, leading to the implementation of an obscure and little-known audio filter. The story still has holes\u2014nobody has ever come forward to state officially which OEM was involved, and which precise laptops and hard drives suffered this problem. That stymies hopes for further research and recreation of this peculiarity. Nevertheless, its a fun tech tale from the days when computers were ever so slightly more mechanical than they are today.\n"}

Just check out this roster of talks that will be going down. Weve got something for everyone out there in the Hackday universe, from poking at pins, to making things beautiful, to robots, radios, and FPGAs. And this isnt even half of the list yet.\nWeve got a great mix of old favorites and new faces this year, and as good as they are, honestly the talks are only half of the fun. The badge hacking, the food, the brainstorming, and just the socializing with the geekiest of the geeky, make it an event you wont want to miss. If you dont have tickets yet, you can still get them here.\nPlus, this year, because Friday night is Halloween, well be hosting a Sci-Fi-themed costume party for those who want to show off their best props or most elaborate spacesuits. And if that is the sort of thing that youre into, you will absolutely want to stay tuned to our Keynote Speaker(s) announcement in a little while. (Spoiler number one.)\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe FitzPatrick\nProbing Pins for Protocol Polyglots\nThis talk explores stacking multiple protocols, like UART, SPI, and I2C, onto the same GPIO pins by exploiting undefined \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d regions. Learn how to bitbang several devices at once, creating protocol polyglots without extra hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElli Furedy\nSandbox Systems: Hardware for Emergent Games\nFrom Conway\u2019s Game of Life to cyberpunk bounty hunting in the desert, this talk explores how thoughtful design in tech and hardware can lead to human connection and community. Elli Furedy shares lessons from years of building hardware and running an immersive experience at the event Neotropolis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew [Cprossu] Lewton\nCracking Open a Classic DOS Game\nTake a nostalgic and technical deep dive into The Lawnmower Man, a quirky full-motion video game for DOS CD-ROM. We\u2019ll explore the tools and techniques used to reverse-engineer the game, uncover how it was built, and wrap things up with a live demo on original hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReid Sox-Harris\nBeyond RGB: The Illuminating World of Color  LEDs\nRGB lighting is everywhere and allows any project to display millions of unique colors. This talk explores the physiology of the human eye that allows RGB to be so effective, when alternatives are better, and how to choose the right lighting for your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyril Engmann\nWhat Makes a Robot Feel Alive? \nThis talk dives into the art and engineering of programming personality into pet robots, crafting behaviors, reactions, and quirks that turns a pile of parts into a companion with presence. Learn design tips, technical insights, and lessons from building expressive bots that blur the line between hardware and character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtem Makarov\n Hacked in Translation: Reverse Engineering Abandoned IoT Hardware\nThis talk takes us on a tour of adventures reviving an abandoned IoT AI translator, 2025-style. From decoding peculiar protocols to reverse engineering firmware  software, discover how curiosity and persistence can breathe new life into forgotten hardware and tackle obscure technical challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamy Kamkar\nOptical Espionage: Lasers to Keystrokes\nWell learn how to identify what a target is typing from a distance through a window with an advanced laser microphone capable of converting infrared to vibrations to radio back to sound, and the electrical, optical, radio, and software components needed for cutting-edge eavesdropping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZachary Peterson\nCal Poly NerdFlare: Bringing #badgelife to Academia\nA small experiment with PCB art and interactive badges became a campus-wide creative movement. Hear how students combined art, technology, and real-world tools to build community, develop skills, and create projects that are as accessible as they are unforgettable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavier de la Torre\nOff the Grid, On the Net: Exploring Ham Radio Mesh Networks.\nThis talk dives into using outdoor wireless access points to join a ham radio mesh network (ham net). Learn how services like weather stations, video streams, email, and VOIP are run entirely over the mesh, without needing commercial internet, all within FCC Part 97 rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebra Ansell\nLEDs Get Into Formation: Mechanically Interesting PCB Assemblies\nThis talk discusses a range of projects built from custom LED PCBs combined into two and three dimensional structures. Explores methods of connecting them into creative arrangements, both static and flexible, including the Bendy SAO which won a prize at Supercon 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hong\nRad Reverb: Cooking FPGAs with Gamma Rays\nThis talk presents research on destructive testing of commercial off-the-shelf (CoTS) FPGAs using cobalt-60 and cesium-137 radiation to study failure modes and resilience in high-radiation environments. Learn about a novel in-situ measurement method that allows real-time observation of integrated circuits during exposure, capturing transient faults and degradation without interrupting operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoug Goodwin\nAurora Blue \nEarth\u2019s magnetic field is glitching out. Phones fail, satellites drop, auroras flood the skies. This talk dives into Aurora Blue, which imagines this future through post-digital imaging hacks: cyanotype prints exposed by custom light-field instruments that flow like auroras. Deep-blue works built to endure, sky relics you can hold after the cloud crashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop News, and another Spoiler\nSadly, weve got to announce that the Meshtastic workshop with Kody Kinzie will not be taking place. But Spoiler Number Two is that the badge this year will have all of the capabilities of that project and much, much more. If youre into LoRA radio, meshes, and handheld devices, youll want to watch out for our badge reveal in the upcoming weeks.\nOh, and go\u00a0get your tickets now before its too late. Supercon has sold out every year, so you cant say that we didnt tell you.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u6700\u65b0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30b3\u30f3\u306f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u591a\u5f69\u306a\u8b1b\u6f14\u3084\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u6700\u65b0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6280\u8853", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u30dd\u30ea\u30b0\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3059\u308b\uff1aGPIO\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u60f3\u50cf\u529b\u3092\u523a\u6fc0\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u7d50\u3073\u3064\u304d", "- \u4eba\u9593\u5473\u3042\u3075\u308c\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "- IoT\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9006\u89e3\u6790\u3067\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

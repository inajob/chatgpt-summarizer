We never did, and would eventually wind up with a flat or, worse, a blowout. These days, your car will probably warn you when your tires are low. Thats because of a class of devices known as tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS).\nIf you are like us, you see some piece of tech like this, and you immediately guess how it probably works. In this case, the obvious guess is sometimes, but not always, correct. There are two different styles that are common, and only one works in the most obvious way.\nObvious Guess\nWed guess that the tire would have a little pressure sensor attached to it that would then wirelessly transmit data. In fact, some do work this way, and thats known as dTPMS where the d stands for direct.\nOf course, such a system needs power, and thats usually in the form of batteries, although there are some that get power wirelessly using an RFID-like system. Anything wireless has to be able to penetrate the steel and rubber in the tire, of course.\n\nBut this isnt always how dTPMS systems worked. In days of old, they used a finicky system involving a coil and a pressure-sensitive diaphragm  more on that later.\nTPMS sensor (by [Lumu] CC BY-SA 3.0Many modern systems use iTPMS (indirect). These systems typically work on the idea that a properly inflated tire will have a characteristic rolling radius. Fusing data from the wheel speed sensor, the electronic steering control, and some fancy signal processing, they can deduce if a tires radius is off-nominal. Not all systems work exactly the same, but the key idea is that they use non-pressure data to infer the tires pressure.\nThis is cheap and requires no batteries in the tire. However, it isnt without its problems. It is purely a relative measurement. In practice, you have to inflate your tires, tell the system to calibrate, and then drive around for half an hour or more to let it learn how your tires react to different roads, speeds, and driving styles.\nChanges in temperature, like the first cold snap of winter, are notorious for causing these sensors to read flat. If the weather changes and you suddenly have four flat tires, thats probably what happened. The tires really do lose some pressure as temperatures drop, but because all four change together, the indirect system can\u2019t tell which one is at fault, if any.\nHistory\nWhen the diaphragm senses correct pressure, the sensor forms an LC circuit. Low air pressure causes the diaphragm to open the switch, breaking the circuit.\nThe first passenger vehicle to offer TPMS was the 1986 Porsche 959. Two sensors made from a diaphragm and a coil are mounted between the wheel and the wheels hub. The sensors were on opposite sides of the tire. With sufficient pressure on the diaphragm, an electrical contact was made, changing the coil value, and a stationary coil would detect the sensor as it passed. If the pressure drops, the electrical contact opens, and the coil no longer sees the normal two pulses per rotation. The technique was similar to a grid dip meter measuring an LC resonant circuit. The diaphragm switch would change the LC circuits frequency, and the sensing coil could detect that.\nIf one or two pulses were absent despite the ABS system noting wheel rotation, the car would report low tire pressure. There were some cases of centrifugal force opening the diaphragms at high speed, causing false positives, but for the most part, the system worked. This isnt exactly iTPMS, but it isnt quite dTPMS either. The diaphragm does measure pressure in a binary way, but it doesnt send pressure data in the way a normal dTPMS system does.\n\nOf course, as you can see in the video, the 959 was decidedly a luxury car. It would be 1991 before the US-made Corvette acquired TPMS. The Renault Laguna II in 2000 was the first high-volume car to have similar sensors.\nNow Theyre Everywhere\nIn many places, laws were put in place to require TPMS in vehicles. It was also critical for cars that used run flat tires. The theory is that you might not notice your run flat tires were actually flat, and while they are, as their name implies, made to run flat, they also require you to limit speed and distance when they are flat.\nOld cars or other vehicles that dont have TPMS can still add it. There are systems that can measure tire pressure and report to a smartphone app. These are, of course, a type of dTPMS.\nProblems\nOf course, there are always problems. An iTPMS system isnt really reading the tire pressure, so it can easily get out of calibration. Direct systems need battery changing, which usually means removing the tire, and a good bit of work  watch the video below. That means there is a big tradeoff between sending data with enough power to go through the tire and burning through batteries too fast.\n\nAnother issue with dTPMS is that you are broadcasting. That means you have to reject interference from other cars that may also transmit. Because of this, most sensors have a unique ID. This raises privacy concerns, too, since you are sending a uniquely identifiable code.\nOf course, your car is probably also beaming Bluetooth signals and who knows what else. Not to even mention what the phone in your car is screaming to the ether. So, in practice, TPMS attacks are probably not a big problem for anyone with normal levels of paranoia.\nAn iTPMS sensor wont work on a tire that isnt moving, so monitoring your spare tire is out. Even dTPMS sensors often stop transmitting when they are not moving to save battery, and that also makes it difficult to monitor the spare tire.\nThe (Half Right) Obvious Answer\nSometimes, when you think of the obvious way something works, you are wrong. In this case, you are half right. TPMS reduces tire wear, prevents accidents that might happen during tire failure, and even saves fuel.\nThanks to this technology, you dont have to remember to check your tire pressure before a trip. You should, however, probably check the tread.\nYou can roll your own TPMS. Or just listen in with an SDR. If biking is more your style, no problem."}

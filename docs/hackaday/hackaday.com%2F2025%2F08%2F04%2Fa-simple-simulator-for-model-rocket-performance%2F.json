To aid in that task, [Rotislav Persion] has created a simple web-based simulator for charting the potential performance of your own rockets.\nThe calculator lets you key in the fundamentals of your hobby rocket. Punch in the diameter of your rocket, its mass, the standard rocket engine youre using, and the diameter and delay time of your parachute, and it will chart the altitude profile expected during flight.\n\nPunch in the details for a small 1-inch diameter rocket with an A8-5 engine, and youll find it wont go very high or very far, and the calculator bears that out. However, upgrade to a C6 engine and youll go higher and faster, and drift a lot longer once the parachute is deployed.\nPerhaps the only thing missing from the simulator is a wider variety of rocket engines to choose from, and more parameters to tweak for finer simulation. However, for small and basic rockets, its an interesting starting point you can use to learn about the basic mathematics and physics behind your rockets flight.\nWeve seen some great feats in model rocketry, not least of which was a valiant effort to master vertical landing.

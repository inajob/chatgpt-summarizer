With enough customers who are less than amused by this boost in useless traffic, Cloudflare has announced that its expanding its blocking feature for the latter category of scrapers. Initially this block was only for poorly behaving scrapers, but now it apparently targets all of such bots.\nThe block seems to be based around a range of characteristics, including the user agent string. According to Cloudflares data on its network, over 40% of identified AI bots came from ByteDance (Bytespider), followed by GPTBot at over 35% and ClaudeBot with 11% and a whole gaggle of smaller bots. Assuming that Impervas claims of bots taking up over half of todays internet traffic are somewhat correct, that means that even if these bots follow robots.txt, that is still a lot of bandwidth being drained and the website owner effectively subsidizing the training of some companys models. Unsurprisingly, Cloudflare notes that many website owners have already taken measures to block these bots in some fashion.\nNaturally, not all of these scraper bots are well-behaved. Spoofing the user agent is an obvious way to dodge blocks, but scraper bot activity has many tell-tale signs which Cloudflare uses, as well as statistical data across its global network to compute a bot score for any requests. Although it remains to be seen whether false positives become an issue with Cloudflares approach, its definitely a sign of the times that more and more website owners are choosing to choke off unwanted, AI-related traffic.", "title": "Cloudflare\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aAI\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af", "body": "\u60aa\u8cea\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5897\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3001Cloudflare\u306f\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30a8\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u6587\u5b57\u5217\u306a\u3069\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304d\u3001\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3002\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u534a\u5206\u3092\u5360\u3081\u308b\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u554f\u984c\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Web\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u6240\u6709\u8005\u306f\u7121\u99c4\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u5bfe\u51e6\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Cloudflare\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aAI\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af", "Cloudflare\u306e\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u4e0d\u6b63\u306aAI\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6392\u9664", "\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30d5\u30ec\u30a2\u304cAI\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u6392\u9664\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u62e1\u5145", "\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30d5\u30ec\u30a2\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\uff1aAI\u95a2\u9023\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6291\u5236", "\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30d5\u30ec\u30a2\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\uff1aAI\u30b9\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

As you might expect, the tickets are tiny, cheap, and dont have any batteries. So how does it work?\nThe chip itself is tiny at 570 \u00b5m \u00d7 485 \u00b5m. [Ken] compares it to a grain of salt. The ticket has a thin plastic core with a comparatively giant antenna onboard.\n\nWorking with such a tiny chip presented additional challenges. A few drops of boiling sulphuric acid freed the die. Then applications of phosphoric acid, Armour etch  nasty stuff, but better than hydroflouric acid  and hydrochloric acid took care of the rest.\nWith everything exposed, it was time to analyze the different parts. As youd expect, the NFC tag draws power from the antenna and sends data from a EEPROM. There was some analog circuitry and also some digital gates used to control the output. But there isnt room for much.\nHow are these so cheap? You can order an 8-inch wafer with 100,587 chips onboard. The price? Around $9,000 per wafer, so about nine cents per chip. Actually, you may be more because the wafer actually has 103,682 dice but a file included tells you which ones are bad. If you want to bargain shop, a 12-inch wafer is $19,000 but gives you 215,712 dice. What a steal!\nCant get enough NFC? We understand. There are times you just want to make your own.", "title": "NFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u89e3\u6790\uff1a\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u4ea4\u901a\u5238\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5206\u89e3", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2Ken Shirriff\u306f\u3001\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4ea4\u901a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308bNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u5c0f\u3055\u304f\u3066\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3082\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306f570 \u00b5m\u00d7485 \u00b5m\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["NFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u89e3\u6790\uff1a\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u4ea4\u901a\u5238\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5206\u89e3", "\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u642d\u8f09\uff1a\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u4ea4\u901a\u5238\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306aNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u89e3\u6790\uff1a\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u306eNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f", "NFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u88fd\u9020\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\uff1a\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u5b89\u3055\u3067\u8a71\u984c\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7", "DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5cNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u6311\u6226"]}

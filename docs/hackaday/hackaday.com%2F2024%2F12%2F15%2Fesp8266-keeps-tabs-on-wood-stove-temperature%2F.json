But it also comes with its own challenges, namely, keeping the fire going at the optimum temperature. If its too cold you risk buildup in the chimney, but if youve got it stoked up more than necessary, youll end up burning through your wood faster.\nTo keep the fire in that sweet spot, [Jay] decided to put an ESP8266 and a thermocouple to work. Now, this might seem like an easy enough job at first, but things are complicated by the fact that the flue temperature above the stove lags considerably behind the temperature inside the stove. Theres also the fact that the top of the chimney will end up being much colder than the bottom.\nMounting the thermocouple in the flue pipe.\nIn an effort to get a more complete view of whats happening, [Jay] plans on putting at least two thermocouples in the chimney. But as getting on the roof in December isnt his idea of fun, for now, hes starting with the lower one thats mounted right above the stove. He popped a hole in the pipe to screw in a standard K-type probe, and tapped it a few times with the welder to make sure it wasnt going anywhere.\nFrom there, the thermocople connects to a MAX6675 amplifier, and then to the WeMos D1 Mini development board thats been flashed with ESPHome. [Jay] provides the configuration file that will get the flue temperature into Home Assistant, as well as set up notifications for various temperature events. The whole thing goes into a 3D printed box, and gets mounted behind the stove.\nThis project is a great example on how you can get some real-world data into Home Assistant quickly and easily. In the future, [Jay] not only wants to add that second thermocouple, but also look into manipulating the stoves air controls with a linear actuator. Heres hoping we get an update as his woodstove learns some new tricks.", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u6728\u88fd\u6696\u623f\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u6728\u71b1\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u71c3\u713c\u7ba1\u7406\u306bESP8266\u3068\u71b1\u96fb\u5bfe\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u6728\u88fd\u6696\u623f\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- ESP8266\u3068\u71b1\u96fb\u5bfe\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u7159\u7a81\u6e29\u5ea6\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- Home Assistant\u3068\u9023\u643a\u3059\u308b\u6696\u623f\u6e29\u5ea6\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6696\u7089\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853"]}

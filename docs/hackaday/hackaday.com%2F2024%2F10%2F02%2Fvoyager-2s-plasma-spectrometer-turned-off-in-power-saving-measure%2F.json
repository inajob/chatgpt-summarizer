With 4 Watt of power less to use by its systems per year, the decision was made to disable the plasma spectrometer (PLS) instrument. As also noted by the NASA Voyager 2 team on Twitter, this doesnt leave the spacecraft completely blind to plasma in the interstellar medium as the plasma wave subsystem (PWS) is still active. The PLS was instrumental in determining in 2018 that Voyager 2 had in fact left the heliosphere and entered interstellar space. The PLS on Voyager 1 had already broken down in 1980 and was turned off in 2007.\nAfter saving the Voyager 1 spacecraft the past months from a dud memory chip and switching between increasingly clogged up thrusters, it was now Voyager 2s turn for a reminder of the relentless march of time and the encroaching end of the Voyager missions. Currently Voyager 2 still has four active instruments, but by the time the power runs out, theyll both be limping along with a single instrument, probably somewhere in the 2030s if their incredible luck holds.\nThis incredible feat was enabled both by the hard work and brilliance of the generations of teams behind the two spacecraft, who keep coming up with new tricks to save power, and the simplicity of the radioisotope generators (RTGs) which keep both Voyagers powered and warm even in the depths of interstellar space.", "title": "Voyager\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u4e88\u7b97\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e2d", "body": "\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc2\u53f7\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u30d0\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u306f4\u5e74\u306b\u7d044\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u6e1b\u5c11\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30d7\u30eb\u30c8\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u306e\u540c\u4f4d\u4f53\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u96fb\u529b\u3082\u5e74\u3005\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff08PLS\uff09\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u7121\u52b9\u306b\u3059\u308b\u6c7a\u5b9a\u304c\u4e0b\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Voyager\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u4e88\u7b97\u304c\u6e1b\u5c11\u4e2d", "Voyager 2\u306ePLS\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u7121\u52b9\u306b", "Voyager\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9\u7a7a\u9593\u3078\u306e\u5230\u9054", "Voyager 1\u3068Voyager 2\u306e\u30a6\u30a9\u30eb\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb", "Voyager\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u9032\u3080\u4e2d\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u554f\u984c"]}

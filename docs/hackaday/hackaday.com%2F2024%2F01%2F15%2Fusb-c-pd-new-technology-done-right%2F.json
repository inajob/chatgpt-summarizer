All of us will know older people who have fallen down this rabbit hole, and certainly anything to do with technological advancement is often high on their list of ills which beset society. Theres a Douglas Adams passage which sums it up nicely:\n\u201cIve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:\n1. Anything that is in the world when you\u2019re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.\n2. Anything thats invented between when you\u2019re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.\n3. Anything invented after youre thirty-five is against the natural order of things.\u201d\nHere at Hackaday were just like anybody else, in that we all get older. Our lives are devoted to an insatiable appetite for new technology, but are we susceptible to the same trap, and could we see something as against the antural order of things simply because we dont like it? Its something that has been on my mind in some way since I wrote a piece back in 2020 railing at the ridiculous overuse of new technologies to limit the lifespan and repairability of new cars and then a manifesto for how the industry might fix it, am I railing against it simply because I cant fix it with a screwdriver in the way I could my 1960 Triumph Herald? I dont think so, and to demonstrate why Id like to talk about another piece of complex new technology that has got everything right.\nIn 2017 I lamented the lack of a universal low voltage DC power socket that was useful, but reading the piece here in 2024 its very obvious that in the years since my quest has been solved. USB Power Delivery was a standard back then, but hadnt made the jump to the ubiquity the USB-C-based power plug and socket enjoys today. Most laptops still had proprietary barrel jack connectors, and there were still plenty of phones with micro-USB sockets. In the years since its become the go-to power standard, and there are a huge number of modules and devices to supply and receive it at pretty high power.\nAt first sight though, it might seem as though USB-PD is simply putting a piece of unnecessary technology in the way of what should be a simple DC connector. Each and every USB-PD connection requires some kind of chip to manage it, to negotiate the connection, and to transform voltage. Isnt that the same as the cars, using extra technology merely for the sake of complexity? On the face of it you might think so, but the beauty lies in it being a universally accepted standard. If car manufacturers needed the same functionalty youd have modules doing similar things in a Toyota, a Ford, or a Renault, but they would all be proprietary and theyd be eye-wateringly expensive to replace. Meanwhile USB-PD modules have to work with each other, so they have become a universal component available for not a huge cost. I have several bags of assorted modules in a box of parts here, and no doubt you do too. The significant complexity of the USB-PD endpoint doesnt matter any more, because should it break then replacing it is an easy and cheap process.\nThis is not to say that USB-PD is without its problems though, the plethora of different cable standards is its Achilies heel. But if youre every accused of a knee-jerk reaction to a bad piece of new technology simply because its new, point them to it as perhaps the perfect example of the responsible use of new technology."}

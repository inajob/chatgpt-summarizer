Were running out of IPv4 addresses! But weve been running out for something like ten years now. What gives? And why are nearly 20% of the worlds IPv4 addresses sitting unused? David has a hack that would give the world 10% more Internet, but Amazon might have something to say about it.\nTheres even more, like Kessler Syndrome, some musing on what the Interplanetary Internet will look like, the worth of real paper books, and a long-term bet for some IPv4 addresses to come to fruition in 2038.\n\nDid you know you can watch the live recording of the show right in the Hackaday Discord? Next week, were interviewing Shawn Dunn about MicroOS and OpenSUSE Kalpa.\n\nDirect Download in DRM-free MP3.\nIf youd rather read along, heres the transcript for this weeks episode.\nPlaces to follow the FLOSS Weekly Podcast:\n\n\n\t<!--  Google Podcasts  -->\n\t<!-- iTunes  -->\n\tSpotify\n\t<!--  Stitcher  -->\n\tRSS\n\t\t<!-- YouTube  -->\n"}

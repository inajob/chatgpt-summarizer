While we cant say if itll stretch your last gigabyte of connectivity into eight, its certainly going to provide awesome signal with all those antennae.\nYou could perhaps coax us to make one of these.\n[Brian] was inspired by the enterprise version of the Hak5 WiFi Pineapple, a high-powered pentesting device. Seeing its plethora of antennae, he was struck with the idea of mounting them all onto a menorah, so he did. The menorah itself is 3D printed (of course) with lots of coax running through it down to the base, where presumably it would be connected to a Pineapple or high-powered router.\nThe project is presented as more of an art piece than a functional device, as theres no evidence that [Brian] has actually hooked it up to anything yet. But consider the possibilities  along with the traditional candles, you could light one WiFi antenna each night, bringing the holiday glow to 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz. If you prefer more visible wavelengths, perhaps this LED menorah would be more to your tastes.\nIf youve got a hack for your culturally-relevant holiday festival, be it Christmas, Hanukkah, or Festivus, wed love to see it. The tips line is open all year round."}

Really hate wires. A lot. So it makes sense that with so many wireless technologies, there should be a way to do USB over wireless. There is, but it really hasnt caught on outside of a few small pockets. [Cameron Kaiser] wants to share why he thinks the technology never went anywhere.\nWireless USB makes sense. We have high-speed wireless networking. Bluetooth doesnt handle that kind of speed, but forms a workable wireless network. In the background, of course, would be competing standards.\nTexas Instruments and Intel wanted to use multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) to carry data using a large number of subcarriers. Motorola (later Freescale), HP, and others were backing the competing direct sequence ultra-wideband or DS-UWB. Attempts to come up with a common system degenerated.\n\nThis led to two systems W-USB (later CF-USB) and CW-USB. CF-USB looked just like regular USB to the computer and software. It was essentially a hub that had wireless connections. CW-USB, on the other hand, had cool special features, but required changes at the driver and operating system level.\nCheck out the post to see a bewildering array of orphaned and incompatible products that just never caught on. As [Cameron] points out, WiFi and Bluetooth have improved to the point that these devices are now largely obsolete.\nOf course, you can transport USB over WiFi, and maybe thats the best answer, today. That is, if you really hate wires."}

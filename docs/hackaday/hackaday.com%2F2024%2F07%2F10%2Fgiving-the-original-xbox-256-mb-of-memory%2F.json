It featured a Pentium 733 MHz CPU with just 64MB of RAM. [Prehistoricman] has been hard at work, figuring out how to up that to 256MB instead.\nThis isnt [Prehistoricmans] first rodeo. Previously, he managed to up the Xboxs RAM to 128 MB. To figure out how to go further, he had to figure out the addressing scheme. A datasheet for the Xboxs original memory chip was a help in this regard, as was the envytools project and an Xbox source code leak.\nA BIOS hack was needed to move the auto-precharge pin to free up more address pins for the higher memory space. Furthermore, the only available memory chips that were suitable used BGA packages, so a small PCB with castellated edges was needed to adapt the chip to the Xboxs motherboard, which expects a TQFP package.\nUltimately, getting this hack to work involved a lot of bare-metal hacking. It also wont help the performance of commercial games at all, as they were all designed within the limitations of the original console. Still, its impressive to see this now-ancient platform hacked to do more. Its also hilarious to compare it with a contemporary PC, which could simply accept 256 MB of RAM by using additional memory slots. Video after the break.\n\n\n\n[Thanks to\u00a0Stephen Walters for the tip!]", "title": "Xbox\u306eRAM\u3092256MB\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Xbox\u306eRAM\u3092128MB\u304b\u3089256MB\u306b\u5897\u3084\u3059\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002BIOS\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3084BGA\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u3055\u306aPCB\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u5546\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u306f\u5f71\u97ff\u306a\u3057\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30dd\u30e9\u30ea\u30fcPC\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3059\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u3002", "titles": ["Xbox\u306eRAM\u3092256MB\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u53e4\u4ee3\u306eXbox\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u5bb9\u91cf\u3092\u62e1\u5f35", "Xbox\u306eBIOS\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u6271\u3044", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u5bb9\u91cf\u5f37\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u53e4\u4ee3\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u767a\u898b"]}

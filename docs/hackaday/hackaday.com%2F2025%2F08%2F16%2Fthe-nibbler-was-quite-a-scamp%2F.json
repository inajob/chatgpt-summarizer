The rousing success of things like the 8080, the Z80, the 6800, and the 6502 made everyone wanted a piece of the action. National Semiconductor produced its SC/MP. That was technically the Simple Cost-effective Micro Processor, but it was commonly known as Scamp. There were several low-cost development boards built around this processor and [Hello World] is looking at Digikeys Nibbler which was a fairly nice computer for only $150. Check it out in the video below.\nThe SC/MP was made to be cheap. It had a strange bank switching scheme reminiscent of the Microchip PIC 16F family. It also had, like a lot of old discrete computers, a serial ALU, which made it slower than many of its contemporaries. It did have good features, though. It was cheap and required very few extra parts along with a single 5 V supply in the second and subsequent versions. In addition, it had pins that were made for connecting more than one CPU, which was quite a feat for those days.\n\n[Hello World] mentions that you dont hear much about the SC/MP anymore and, in fact, we had all but forgotten about it. There is an effort underway to recreate the plucky little computer for anyone who wants to build a new one.\nThe $150 price tag seems reasonable, at least compared to other computers of the day. However, dont forget that you still need a power supply, probably a card cage, and the biggest problem of all: a terminal. It is hard to remember how difficult it used to be to get your hands on a terminal at a reasonable cost. Your main choices were a TV typewriter or something surplus like a TeleType.\n\n", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8208\u4ea1\uff1a1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "body": "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u3001SC/MP\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u958b\u767a\u304c\u9032\u3080\u4e2d\u3001\u518d\u73fe\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8208\u4ea1\uff1a1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f8c\u534a\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- SC/MP\uff08\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\uff09\uff1a\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30c7\u30a3\u30ae\u30ad\u30fc\u306eNibbler\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- \u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068SC/MP\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308bSC/MP\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a\u6614\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

They also experimented with shaping the hydrogels as a Seifert ribbon.\nThe key is that the hydrogels contain gold nanoparticles. Light heats the gold particles and this causes the hydrogels to move. The connections between the strips of hydrogels causes them to move in predictable ways. You can see a video about the experiments below.\nThese robots arent going to be for warehouse or factory work. But they can do tasks like collecting plastic beads, something difficult for conventional robots to do. They also hope to demonstrate that these soft robots could work in the body for taking samples or delivering a drug, although it isnt apparent how light would get to them inside your body.\nThe dark side of the material tends to turn towards the light. The continuous loop structure means it never runs to the end of its travel. Watching it move on a string is pretty impressive.\nCrawling and slithering robots may be the answer for certain specialized applications. After all, it works well in nature.\n\n"}

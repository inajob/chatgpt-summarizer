It is hard to make things that last through the ages, which is why we are fascinated with things like ancient pyramids in Mexico, Egypt, and China. However, even the oldest Egyptian pyramid is only about 5,000 years old. [Mark Piesing] at the BBC visited a site that is supposed to lock up nuclear waste for 100,000 years.\nThis particular project is in France, but there are apparently dozens of similar projects around the world. Locating these nuclear tombs is tricky. They need to be in a geologically stable area that wont contaminate water. They also prefer areas already depleted of resources to lessen the chance someone will be digging nearby in the far future. You also need people to agree to have these facilities in their communities, which is probably the most difficult thing to find.\n\nBurying anything 500 meters underground is a challenge. But we were interested in how youd plan to keep the material safely away from people for 20 times longer than the pyramids have stood next to the Nile.\u00a0 Anything could happen over that timescale, and it seems unlikely that youll have an organization that can last that long and stand watch over these dangerous vaults. If they poke around in these holes, future archeologists could deal with a very real cursed tomb.\nOf course, the whole idea is controversial. But putting that aside, how would you design something to last 100,000 years and stay secure? Let us know in the comments. It would be good practice for that generation ship to Bernards Star.\nWeve seen that it is hard to keep a clock running for even 100 years. Already, 50-year-old computers seem incredibly antique. What will tech be like in 100,000 years?", "title": "100,000\u5e74\u9593\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4fdd\u7ba1: \u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30e9\u30eb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "100\u5e74\u5f8c\u306b\u306f\u3055\u3089\u306b10\u500d\u306b\u306a\u308b\u672a\u6765\u306b\u6211\u3005\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3082\u306e\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u60f3\u50cf\u3057\u306b\u304f\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u30d4\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5805\u7262\u306a\u3082\u306e\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3064\u4eba\u9054\u3082\u3044\u308b\u3002\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u309210\u4e07\u5e74\u9593\u4fdd\u7ba1\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u56f0\u96e3\u3092\u4f34\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["100,000\u5e74\u9593\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4fdd\u7ba1: \u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30e9\u30eb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u9577\u671f\u4fdd\u5b58\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u5730\u4e2d\u6df1\u304f\u57cb\u8535\uff1a100,000\u5e74\u306e\u53b3\u91cd\u9632\u8b77", "\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30e9\u30eb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30af", "\u9577\u5bff\u547d\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306e\u8b0e"]}

It does take more work to modify them or change how Apple wants them to behave, but its not completely impossible. Take this example of a 94 Apple PowerBook which runs macOS Moneterey thanks largely to new internals from a 2015 MacBook Pro.\n[Billy] originally intended for a Raspberry Pi to go inside this old PowerBook, but at the time, prices for ARM single-board computer (SBC) were astronomical. For around the same price as the Pi was at the time, he was able to pick up a retina display from an iPad and the internals from a broken MacBook Pro to outfit this retro case. Theres also a Teensy installed to get the trackpad working and a driver board for the display from Adafruit, and a number of case mods were needed to get everything to fit including the screen which was slightly larger than the original 9.5 display the laptop would have shipped with.\nThis project took both inspiration and some of the actual code needed to get everything working from another project we featured a while ago where a Mac Mini was installed inside of a PowerBook case from 1993. Unlike projects that use smaller SBCs for retrocomputing, these builds are notable because the hardware on the inside makes them usable as daily driver computers even today, and might even be an upgrade if youre using the internals from a MacBook Pro that would have originally had a butterfly keyboard.\n\n"}

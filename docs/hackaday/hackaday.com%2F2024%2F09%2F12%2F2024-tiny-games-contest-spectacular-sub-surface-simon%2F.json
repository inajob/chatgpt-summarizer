Then, if you work with even smaller packages, stuff like 0603 might as well be through-hole components.\n[alnwlsn] is no stranger to the small, having worked almost exclusively with surface mount components for a few years now. Even so, theyve built up an admirable stock of DIP chips, including the ATtiny84 DIP-14 that their incredible Simon game is built into.\nHow in the world did [alnwlsn] accomplish this? As youll see in the video after the break, the answer lies in milling, but with the motors disconnected and manually turning the knobs.\nSoldering didnt require anything special, just the usual suspects like a fine-tipped iron, an X-acto knife, some tweezers, and a few other things like a hot air gun for soldering fine wires to the leadframe. Oh, and of course, really steady hands, and lots of patience.\nThe 2024 Tiny Games Contest officially closed on Tuesday, September 10th. Well have the results out as soon as possible. Best of luck to all who entered!\n\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "0603\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f DIY \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "body": "\u624b\u5148\u3092\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3001\u3055\u3089\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u3082\u901a\u5e38\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002[alnwlsn]\u306f\u8868\u9762\u5b9f\u88c5\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u6163\u308c\u3001ATtiny84 DIP-14\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fSimon\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3002\u90e8\u54c1\u306f\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u306f\u7d30\u3044\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u9244\u3084\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["0603\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f DIY \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "DIP\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u90e8\u54c1\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051", "\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u534a\u7530\u4ed8\u3051\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u9053\u5177\u3068\u624b\u9806", "2024 Tiny Games Contest\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

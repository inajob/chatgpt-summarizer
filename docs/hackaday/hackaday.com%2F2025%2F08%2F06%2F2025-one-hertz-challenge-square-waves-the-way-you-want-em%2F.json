Sometimes theres a less demanding need for a clock signal though, and one way that might be served comes from [Rupin Chheda]s square wave generator. Its a small PCB designed to sit at the end of a breadboard and provide handy access to a range of clocks.\nOn the board is a crystal oscillator running at the usual digital clock frequency of 32.768 kHz, and a CMOS divider chain. This provides frequencies from 2048 Hz down to 0.5 Hz for good measure. Its a simple but oh-so-useful board, and we can imagine more than a few of you finding space for it on your own benches.\nThis project is part of our awesome 2025 One Hertz Challenge, celebrating all the things which strut their stuff once a second. Its by no means the first to feature a 32.768 kHz divider chain, and if you have a similar project theres still time to enter.\n \n\n\n"}

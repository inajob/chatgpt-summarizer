But [Slant 3D]s tips sure goes a long way toward making a part lose that obvious 3D-printed look. They also dovetail nicely with advice on how to optimize cranking out high numbers of parts in a print farm.\nAdding texture to the outer layer is especially effective when combined with non-traditional part orientations.\nOne simple way to avoid visible layer lines is to put some kind of texture onto the part. This can be modeled into the parts surface, or the slicer software can be used to modify the exterior of the print to add a texture such as a geometric pattern or by applying a fuzzy skin modifier.\nPrinting a texture onto the exterior is great, but the outcome can be even further improved by also printing the object in a non-traditional orientation.\nUsing a cube as an example, printing the cube on a corner has the advantage of putting the layer lines in a different orientation as well as minimizing the contact area on the print bed. This applies the texture across more of the part, and looks less obviously 3D printed in the process. Minimizing bed adhesion also makes parts much easier to remove, which has obvious benefits for production. [Slant 3D] points out that performing these operations on a 3D-printed part is essentially free.\nA few other optimizations for production involve rounding sharp corners to optimize tool travel paths, and putting a slight chamfer on the bottom of parts to avoid any elephant foot distortion (Elephants foot can be compensated for, but simply putting a slight chamfer on a part is a design change that helps avoid accounting for machine-to-machine variance.)\nEven if one has no need to optimize for high production volume, the tips on hiding layer lines with design changes is great advice. Watch it all in action in the short video, embedded below.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u96a0\u3059\uff1a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "[Slant 3D]\u306f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3057\u3001\u4f59\u5206\u306a\u52a0\u5de5\u304c\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u304f\u306a\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u3002\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u4f8b\u3067\u751f\u7523\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3068\u5c64\u306e\u898b\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30c6\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u8ffd\u52a0\u3084\u975e\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u5411\u304d\u3082\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u96a0\u3059\uff1a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5de5\u592b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u751f\u7523\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6700\u9069\u5316", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5411\u304d\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306e\u52b9\u679c", "\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u7dda\u3092\u96a0\u3057\u3001\u5916\u89b3\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

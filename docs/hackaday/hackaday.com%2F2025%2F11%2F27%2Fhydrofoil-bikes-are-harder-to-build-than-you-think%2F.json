However, as [RCLifeOn] demonstrates, you can also use them to build fun and quirky personal watercraft. Like a hydrofoil bike! Only, there are some challenges involved.\nHydrofoils work much like airfoils in air. The shape of the foil creates lift, raising the attached vehicle out of the water. This allows the creation of a craft that can travel more quickly because the majority of its body is not subject drag from the water. The key is to design the craft such that the hydrofoils remain at the right angle and depth to keep the craft lifted out of the water while remaining stable.\nThe hydrofoil bike is created out of a combination of plywood, foam, and 3D printed components. It uses a powerful brushless motor for propulsion, and thats about it. Sadly, despite the simplicity, it wasnt an instant success. As you might expect, balancing on the bike is quite difficult, particularly when trying to get it started\u2014as the foils need some speed to actually start generating meaningful lift.\nAfter further research into commercial hydrofoil bikes, [RCLifeOn] realized that the buoyancy of the bike made it too hard to straddle when starting out. Some of the 3D printed foils also proved more than a little fragile.\u00a0Its back to the drawing board for now\u2014the power system is likely up to snuff, but the dynamics of the platform need work. Its perhaps no surprise; weve covered the challenges of hydrofoil stability before. If you want to go fast on water, you could go the easier route and just build an electric surfboard.

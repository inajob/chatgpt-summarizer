If youve hung out with a lifeguard, though, you might instead have fretted over the dangers. In any case, it remains a popular pastime, and its all the more fun with a light-up surfboard like this one from [Moritz Sivers].\nThis project came about due to a local tradition for [Moritz], where people often surf at night to avoid the crowded breaks during the day. The build started from scratch, with a foam blank shaped into a compact\u00a0 design optimized for riversurfing, with three fins set up in a thruster configuration. The back side of the board was given a coat of resin impregnated with glow-in-the-dark pigment such that the entire thing would emit an nice green glow, making it more visible at night. On the top surface, a pocket was cut in the board to host electronics for running an electroluminescent panel, complete with artwork inspired by 2001  A Space Odyssey.\u00a0The board was also outlined with EL wire to further improve the look.\n[Moritz] has experimented with some neat LED surfboard designs before, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u591c\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b", "body": "\u591c\u306b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u304c\u5371\u967a\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5149\u308b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3002\u591c\u3067\u3082\u3088\u304f\u898b\u3048\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5f8c\u308d\u5074\u306b\u5149\u308b\u5857\u6599\u3092\u5857\u308a\u3001\u96fb\u5149\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3068EL\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3082\u88c5\u7740\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4ee5\u524d\u306b\u3082\u9762\u767d\u3044LED\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8a66\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30eb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u591c\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b", "\u8f1d\u304f\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u591c\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080", "\u5149\u308b\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308b", "\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30eb\u30df\u30cd\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u591c\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88c5\u98fe\u3059\u308b", "LED\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b5\u30fc\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

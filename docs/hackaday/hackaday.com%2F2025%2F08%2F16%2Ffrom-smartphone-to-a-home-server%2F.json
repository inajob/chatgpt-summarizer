[Hardware Haven] evidently has the opposite idea, given he just made a video about making the cheapest, smallest server possible: an Android phone.\nSure, its not going to be streaming terabytes of data at multiple gigabytes per second, but thats not everyones use case. Dont forget, flagship phones had multiple cores and gigabytes of RAM a decade ago, so even an old and busted smartphone has more than enough power for something like Home Assistant, which is what gets installed in this video.\nAfter considering loading termux and rooting his device for Docker-on-Android, he opted for postmarketOS, the premiere Linux for old smartphones. Thats not because the Linux environment you get with termux wouldnt work; its just that he wanted something native. To that end, he bought a somewhat worse-for-wear Xiaomi Mi A1 from eBay to get hardware Alpine-based postmarket could use.\nSoftware wise, it was just a matter of following instructions and reading manuals  Linux is Linux, after all. The firewall proved to be his main challenge, though trying to branch out from Home Assistant to run Minecraft Server did run into Java issues [Hardware Haven] had no interest in troubleshooting. Hardware wise, though, well  do you want to leave a phone plugged in permanently? Smokey the Bear suggests you not, especially if you live near a forest. Besides, you probably dont want your server on WiFi, and at least this smartphone wouldnt charge when using a networking dongle.\nThat meant phone surgery: the battery came out, and 5 V from an old USB charger was piped into the battery charge controller via a diode. The diode was used for its voltage drop, to bring the 5 V supply down to a believable battery voltage  a buck converter might have been better, but you use what you have, and the diode drop doesnt dissipate much power. Power dissipation is still one watt at idle, six during a stress test.\nGiven how cheap the phone was, and how little power this thing sips, [Hardware Heaven] has an excellent answer to those who say homelabbing is a rich persons hobby. This project also reminds us that while our phones might not be as hackable as wed like, theyre still far from totally locked down. You can even run NixOS on (some of) them.\n\n"}

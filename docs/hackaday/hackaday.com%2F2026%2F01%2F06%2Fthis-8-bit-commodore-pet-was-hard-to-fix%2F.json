WARNING: contains 8-bit assembly code.\nThe Trinity of 1977 which started the personal computer revolution were the Apple II, the Commodore PET, and the TRS-80. In this project its a failing Commodore PET which is being restored.\n\nIn the video below the break you can see [Ken Shirriff] and [CuriousMarc] team up to crack this tough nut. Resolving the various issues required a whole heap of software and equipment. Most notably a Keysight DSOX3104T oscilloscope, a Retro Chip Tester Pro, an old Agilent 1670G logic analyzer (this thing is rocking a 3.5 floppy disk drive!), an old Agilent 54622A oscilloscope (also rocking a floppy drive!), a Data I/O 29B Universal Programmer With UniPak 2 insert, and the disassembly software Ghidra.\nIn the end there were 6 (and a half) bad chips which needed to be discovered and then replaced. This project is a reminder that its nice to have the right tools for the job!\nIf youre interested in the Commodore PET you might like to read A Tricky Commodore PET Repair And A Lesson About Assumptions or Tracking Satellites With A Commodore PET.\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u9769\u547d\u306e\u8d77\u6e90\uff1a\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebPET\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Commodore PET\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u8a18\u4e8b\u30026\u500b\u534a\u306e\u4e0d\u826f\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5fa9\u5143\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u9769\u547d\u306e\u8d77\u6e90\uff1a\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebPET\u4fee\u7406\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 6.5\u500b\u306e\u4e0d\u826f\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\uff01\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebPET\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u6311\u6226", "- \u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u5de5\u5177\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff1a\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebPET\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebPET\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u79d8\u8a23"]}

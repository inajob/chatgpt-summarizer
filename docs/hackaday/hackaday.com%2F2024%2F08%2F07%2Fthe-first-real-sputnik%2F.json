At a time when the world was larger and scarier, the Soviets had a metal basketball flying over the United States and the rest of the world. It made people nervous, but it was also a tremendous scientific achievement. However, it wasnt the plan to use it as the first orbiter, as [Scott Manley] explains in a recent video that you can see below.\nThe original design would become Sputnik 3, which, as [Scott] puts it, was the first Soviet satellite that didnt suck. The first one was essentially a stunt, and the second one had an animal payload and thermal problems that killed the canine occupant, [Laika].\n\nMost people dont remember the later Sputnik missions. However, they did some of the first science in Earths orbit. [Scott] has a lot of history related to the early days of space science.\nThe original Sputnik did little more than beep from orbit. We were surprised the CIA didnt swipe one of them.\n"}

But in Denmark they do things differently it seems, which is why they are giving Danes the copyright over their own features such as their faces or voices. Why? To combat deepfakes, meaning that if you deepfake a Dane, they can come after you for big bucks, or indeed kronor. Its a major win, in privacy terms.\nYou might of course ask, whether its now risky to photograph a Dane. We are not of course lawyers here but like any journalists we have to possess a knowledge of how copyright works, and we are guessing that the idea in play here is that of passing off. If you take a photograph of a Volkswagen you will have captured the VW logo on its front, but the car company will not sue you because you are not passing off something thats not a Volkswagen as the real thing. So it will be with Danes; if you take a picture of their now-copyrighted face in a crowd you are not passing it off as anything but a real picture of them, so we think you should be safe.\nWe welcome this move, and wish other countries would follow suit.\n\nPope Francis, Midjourney, Public domain, (Which is a copyright story all of its own!)", "title": "\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3001\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u6cd5\u3067\u5e02\u6c11\u306e\u9854\u3084\u58f0\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77", "body": "\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306f\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9854\u3084\u58f0\u306e\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30af\u5bfe\u7b56\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u306e\u5927\u304d\u306a\u52dd\u5229\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3001\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u6cd5\u3067\u5e02\u6c11\u306e\u9854\u3084\u58f0\u3092\u4fdd\u8b77", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30af\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u6cd5", "\u5e02\u6c11\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff01\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u6539\u9769", "\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306e\u5199\u771f\u64ae\u5f71\u306f\u5b89\u5168\uff1f\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u306e\u65b0\u5e38\u8b58", "\u30c7\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u8457\u4f5c\u6a29\u6cd5\u5909\u66f4\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u56fd\u969b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff"]}

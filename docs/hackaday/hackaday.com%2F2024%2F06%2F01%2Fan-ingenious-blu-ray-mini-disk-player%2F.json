Easily fitting inside a pocket like a 8 cm CD player would, this is a labour of love and, thanks to [befi]s skills both in electronics and in using a dremel tool.\nA BluRay drive was taken apart, for a start, and a lot of case parts were cut off; somehow, [befi] made it fit within an exceptionally tiny footprint, getting new structural parts printed instead, to a new size. The space savings let him put a fully custom F1C100S-powered board with a number of unique features, from a USB-SATA chip to talk to the BluRay drive, to USB pathway control for making sure the player can do USB gadget mode when desired.\nTheres an OLED screen on the side, buttons for controlling the playback, power and battery management  this player is built to a high standard, ready for day-to-day use as your companion, in the world where leaving your smartphone as uninvolved in your life as possible is a surprisingly wise decision. As a fun aside, did you know that while 8 cm CDs and DVDs existed, 8 cm BluRay drives never made it to market? If youre wondering how is it that [befi] has disks to play in this device, yes, hes used a dremel here too.\nEverything is open-sourced  3D print files, the F1C100S board, and the Buildroot distribution complete with all the custom software used. If you want to build such a player, and we wouldnt be surprised if you were, theres more than enough resources for you to go off. And, if youre thinking of building something else in a similar way, the Buildroot image will be hugely helpful.\nWant some entertainment instead? Watch the video embedded below, the build journey is full of things you never knew you wanted to learn. This player is definitely a shining star on the dark path that is Blu-Ray, given that our most popular articles on Blu-Ray are about its problems.\n\n", "title": "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "[befi]\u306f8cm CD\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eBlu-Ray\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3068Dremel\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3067\u3001BluRay\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306eF1C100S\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5168\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u306b\u306f\u5341\u5206\u306a\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30df\u30cb\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c BluRay \u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e BluRay \u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba BluRay \u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc"]}

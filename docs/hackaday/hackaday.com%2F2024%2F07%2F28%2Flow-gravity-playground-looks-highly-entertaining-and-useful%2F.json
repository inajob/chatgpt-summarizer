At 1/6th Earths gravity, the difference can be difficult to simulate.\nBut not anymore. French acrobatic artist [Bastien Dausse] has created a contraption that does exactly that. [Dausse] straps himself in, and is instantly able to slowly sproing about, up and down and all around in semi-slow motion, using this device which is calibrated to the Moons gravity. [Dausse]s troupes performances center on the idea of gravity and of subverting it.\nIn order to achieve this effect, the swooping sculpture uses a pair of large counterweights. Check out the video below to see how they too become part of the action during a captivating duet performance. Although not attached, part of the device is a disk on which it smoothly moves around. It looks really fun, and more than a little bit dangerous. But mostly fun.\nDid you know that Da Vinci created several experiments dedicated to determining the properties of gravity?\n\n"}

At 1/6th Earths gravity, the difference can be difficult to simulate.\nBut not anymore. French acrobatic artist [Bastien Dausse] has created a contraption that does exactly that. [Dausse] straps himself in, and is instantly able to slowly sproing about, up and down and all around in semi-slow motion, using this device which is calibrated to the Moons gravity. [Dausse]s troupes performances center on the idea of gravity and of subverting it.\nIn order to achieve this effect, the swooping sculpture uses a pair of large counterweights. Check out the video below to see how they too become part of the action during a captivating duet performance. Although not attached, part of the device is a disk on which it smoothly moves around. It looks really fun, and more than a little bit dangerous. But mostly fun.\nDid you know that Da Vinci created several experiments dedicated to determining the properties of gravity?\n\n", "title": "\u6708\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u8a13\u7df4", "body": "2026\u5e74\u306b\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u304c\u6708\u306b\u623b\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u6708\u306e\u91cd\u529b\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u4e8b\u524d\u306b\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u6708\u306e\u91cd\u529b\u3092\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u3067\u91cd\u529b\u306e\u6982\u5ff5\u3092\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u30c0\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u3082\u91cd\u529b\u306e\u6027\u8cea\u3092\u7814\u7a76\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u6708\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b87\u5b99\u98db\u884c\u58eb\u8a13\u7df4", "\u6708\u306e\u91cd\u529b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u6708\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u4f53\u9a13\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5b9f\u6f14", "\u6708\u306e\u91cd\u529b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30af\u30ed\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9", "\u91cd\u529b\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30c0\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c1\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

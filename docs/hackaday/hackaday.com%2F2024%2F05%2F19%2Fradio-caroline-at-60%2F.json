There was a seemingly endless supply of both radio stations and 45s to keep you entertained. In the UK and other countries, though, the government held a monopoly on broadcasting, and they were not always enthralled with the music kids liked. Where there is demand, there is an opportunity, and several enterprising broadcasters set up radio stations at sea, the so-called pirate radio stations. In 1964, Irish businessman [Ronan ORahilly] did just this and founded Radio Caroline. Can you imagine that 60 years later, Radio Caroline is still around?\nNot that it has been in operation for 60 years in a row. There were a few years the stations ship had been impounded by creditors. Then, the ship ran aground on the Goodwin Sands and was damaged. You can see a news short from 1965 in the video below (Radio Caroline shows up at about the 1:50 mark).\n\nTrue, Radio Caroline isnt quite the same as it was. They operate mostly from a legal onshore studio now. But one weekend a month, a crew operates from the ship now in British waters.\nBack in 1964, you might have had problems picking up Radio Caroline from far away. Now, the pirate station is as close as your web browser. The other big pirate station was RNI, and they are still around, too.\n", "title": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6d77\u8cca\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4eca", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3084\u4ed6\u56fd\u3067\u306f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40\u306e\u4f9b\u7d66\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u653e\u9001\u5c40\u306f\u6d77\u8cca\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u3092\u958b\u59cb\u30021964\u5e74\u3001\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u51fa\u8eab\u306e[Ronan ORahilly]\u304cRadio Caroline\u3092\u8a2d\u7acb\u3002\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u6d3b\u52d5\u3057\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u8074\u53d6\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6d77\u8cca\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4eca", "\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u5b9f\u696d\u5bb6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30ed\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5275\u8a2d", "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30ed\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306e60\u5e74\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "\u6d77\u8cca\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u653e\u9001\u304b\u3089\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3078", "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u6620\u50cf\u306b\u898b\u308b60\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30ed\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3"]}

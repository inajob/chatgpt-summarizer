Smartphones that feature an incredible amount of computational power compared to computers the past, are largely locked down by carriers or manufacturers, dooming them to performing trivial tasks far below their true capabilities.\nBut there is hope. In part one of this build, a OnePlus 6T is stripped of its Android operating system in favor of postmarketOS, a Linux distribution based on Alpine designed for a number of Android phones and tablets as well as some Linux-only handhelds. The guide also demonstrates how to remove the battery and use a modified USB-C cable to essentially trick the battery management system into powering up the phone anyway. The second part of the project dives into the software side, getting the Linux system up and running before installing Docker and whichever Docker containers the user needs.\nThere are a few downsides to running a server from a smartphone. Although theres plenty of processing power available for a wide range of applications, most phones wont have Ethernet support out-of-the-box which forces the use of WiFi. Theres also limited storage options available, so a large NAS system may be out of reach. But for something like a home automation system or a music streaming server this could put plenty of older devices to work again. And if you dont want to hunt for an Android phone that isnt completely hobbled out-of-the box you might want to try a phone thats Linux-based from the get-go instead.\nThanks to [JohnU] for the tip!", "title": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u771f\u306e\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\uff1apostmarketOS\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u6cd5", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u306f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u5236\u9650\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002Linux\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u65e7\u578b\u3082\u6d3b\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u771f\u306e\u529b\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\uff1apostmarketOS\u306e\u5c0e\u5165\u6cd5", "Android\u3092\u6368\u3066\u3066Linux\u3078\uff1aOnePlus 6T\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01Docker\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u53e4\u3044\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u6d3b\u7528\uff1a\u5bb6\u4e2d\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3084\u97f3\u697d\u914d\u4fe1\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u6700\u9069", "Linux\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u9650\u754c\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

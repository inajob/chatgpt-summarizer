This means that you likely will only get one shot at dumping the OTP data before the memory is burned out.\nThe copy protection normally returns scrambled OTP data, with an example of PIC Burnout provided for the PIC16LC63A. After entering programming mode by setting the ICSP CLK pin high, excessively high programming voltage and duration is used repeatedly while checking that an area that normally reads as zero now reads back proper data. After this the OTP should be read out repeatedly to ensure that the scrambling has been circumvented.\nThe trick appears to be that while theres over-voltage and similar protections on much of the Flash, this approach can still be used to affect the entire flash bit column. Suffice it to say that this method isnt very kind to the fzslash memory cells and can take hours to get a good dump. Even after this you need to know the exact scrambling method used, which is fortunately often documented by Microchip datasheets.\nThanks to [DjBiohazard] for the tip.", "title": "- PIC\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306eOTP\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5\u300cPIC Burnout\u300d", "body": "PIC MCU\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u3092\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u300cPIC Burnout\u300d\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3002OTP\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u4e00\u5ea6\u3060\u3051\u8aad\u307f\u51fa\u305b\u308b\u304c\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u304c\u7834\u640d\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- PIC\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306eOTP\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308b\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5\u300cPIC Burnout\u300d", "- \u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u4fdd\u8b77\u3092\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "- \u5fae\u7d30\u52a0\u5de5\u6280\u8853\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u3001PIC\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306eOTB\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u62bd\u51fa", "- \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u6280\u8853\uff1aPIC Burnout\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- Microchip\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u89e3\u9664\u6cd5"]}

But forget modern Wi-Fi dongles\u2014this hack involves an old-school D-Link DWL-G810 wireless Ethernet bridge. You can see the Amiga in action in the video below.\n[Chris] has a quirky approach to retrofitting. He connects an Ethernet adapter to his Amiga, bridges it to the D-Link, and sets up an open Wi-Fi network\u2014complete with a retro 11 Mbps speed. Then again, the old wired connection was usually 10 Mbps in the old days.\nTo make it work, he even revived an old Apple AirPort Extreme as a supporting router since the old bridge didnt support modern security protocols. Ultimately, the Amiga gets online wirelessly, albeit at a leisurely pace compared to today\u2019s standards. He later demonstrates an upgraded bridge that lets him connect to his normal network.\nWeve used these wireless bridges to put oscilloscopes and similar things on wireless, but newer equipment usually requires less work even if it doesnt already have wireless.\u00a0 Weve also seen our share of strange wireless setups like this one. If you are going to put your Amgia on old-school networking, you might as well get Java running, too.\n\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebAmiga\u3092\u7121\u7dda\u5316", "body": "Chris Edwards\u304cCommodore Amiga 3000T\u3092\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u305f\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3002D-Link DWL-G810\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30a8\u30a2\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3002Amiga\u304c\u9045\u3044\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30ebAmiga\u3092\u7121\u7dda\u5316", "\u53e4\u3044D-Link\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fAmiga\u306eDIY\u6539\u9020", "Amiga\u3092\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a11 Mbps\u306eWi-Fi\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a", "Apple AirPort Extreme\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Amiga\u3092\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u5316", "\u53e4\u3044\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aAmiga\u306eWi-Fi\u5316"]}

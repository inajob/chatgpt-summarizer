The obvious answer: program an Arduino to do it. Some aluminum extrusion and solenoids later, and it was working. Well, perhaps not quite that easy  making music on a piano is more than just pushing the keys. You have to push multiple keys together and control the power behind each strike to make the music sound natural.\nThe project is massive since he chose to put solenoids over each key. Honestly, we might have been tempted to model ten fingers and move the solenoids around in two groups of five. True, the way it is, it can play things that would not be humanly possible, but ten solenoids, ten drivers, and two motors might have been a little easier and cheaper.\nThe results, however, speak for themselves. He did have one problem with the first play, though. The solenoids have a noticeable click when they actuate. The answer turned out to be orthodontic rubber bands installed on the solenoids. We arent sure we would have thought of that.\nPlayer pianos, of course, are nothing new. And, yes, you can even make one with a 555. If a piano isnt your thing, maybe try a xylophone instead.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u30a2\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u6f14\u594f\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3002\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3067\u9375\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u6f14\u594f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u6f14\u594f\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u96e3\u89e3\u3055\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "- \u97f3\u697d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2: \u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u3068\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- \u3082\u3057\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u306a\u3089\u3001\u6728\u7434\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01"]}

Obvious problems with voice control include things like multiple people talking over each other, discerning commands from background conversations, and so on. Somehow, unlike on the bridge in Star Trek, where the computer seems to understand everyone just fine, Al sometimes can\u2019t even get the darn thing to play his going-to-sleep playlist, which should be well within the device\u2019s capabilities.\nIn the comments, [rclark] suggests making a single button that plays his playlist, no voice interaction required, and we have to admit that it\u2019s a great solution to this one particular problem. Heck, the \u201cbedtime button\u201d would make fun project in and of itself, and it\u2019s such a limited scope that it could probably only be an weekend\u2019s work for anyone who has touched the internals of their home automation system, like Al certainly has. We love the simplicity of the idea.\nBut it ignores the biggest potential benefit of a voice control system: that it\u2019s a one-size-fits-all solution for everything. Imagine how many other use cases Al would need to make a single button device for, and how many coin cell batteries he\u2019d be signing himself up to change out over the course of the year. The trade-off is that the general purpose solution tends not to be as robust as a single-tasker like the button, but also that it can potentially simplify the overall system.\nI suffer this in my own home. It\u2019s much more a loosely-coupled web of individual hacks than an overall system, and that has pros and cons. Each individual part is easier to maintain and hack on, but the overall system is less coordinated than it could be. If we change the WiFi password on the home automation router, for instance, I\u2019m going to have to individually log into about eight ESP8266s and change their credentials. Yuck!\nIt\u2019s probably a matter of preference, but I\u2019ll still take the loose, MQTT-based system that I\u2019ve got now over an all-in-one. Like [rclark], I value individual device simplicity and reliability above the overall system\u2019s simplicity, but because our stereo isn\u2019t even hooked up to the network, I can\u2019t play myself to sleep like Al can. Or at least like he can when the voice recognition is working.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Even when they work, vintage drives often have trouble with CD-R, and original media isnt always easy to find. Thats why its so wonderful that [polpo]s RP2040 ISA card, the PicoGUS 2.0, now supports CD-ROM emulation.\nWe covered PicoGUS when it first appeared as an ISA sound card,\u00a0 and make no mistake, it can still emulate sound cards for retro-PC beeps and boops. Its not just the Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) from which the project took its name, but Sound Blaster 2.0, MPU-401 for MIDI, Tandy 3-voice, and CMS/GameBlaster are all soft options. Like most sound cards back in the day, PicoGUS provides game port support as well.\n\nWe dont recall sound cards that served as CD-ROM controllers, but apparently, that was a thing before IDE became the standard for optical drives. We do recall old CD-ROM drives that shipped with proprietary driver boards, and PicoGUS emulates Panasonics MKS standard, which apparently did show up on some sound cards. For the end-user, that doesnt matter much: once its all set up using the open-source utilities (and appropriate drivers), youll have an optical drive sitting at D:.\nTheres a USB port on the PicoGUS that lets you use a FAT32 formatted USB stick not as a CD drive, but a CD changer. You can access multiple disk images from the drive, selecting them with the utility software. Theres even a feature that lets you automatically advance to the next disk by removing and reinserting the drive, which is invaluable for multi-CD game installers. Its not super speedy: in USB mode, expect it to run as fast as a 4x drive. (2x if the PicoGUS is emulating a Sound Blaster at the same time.) Considering thats all with a single RP2040 in charge, its pretty fast. For a DOS box, its probably period appropriate, too.\nThe Almighty Algorithm reminded us about PicoGUS in a video by [vswitchero], which is embedded below for those of you who would like more information in the form of rapidly flickering images and sound.\n<!--more-->\n"}

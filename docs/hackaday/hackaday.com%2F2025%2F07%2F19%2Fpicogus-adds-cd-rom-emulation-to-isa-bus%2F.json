Even when they work, vintage drives often have trouble with CD-R, and original media isnt always easy to find. Thats why its so wonderful that [polpo]s RP2040 ISA card, the PicoGUS 2.0, now supports CD-ROM emulation.\nWe covered PicoGUS when it first appeared as an ISA sound card,\u00a0 and make no mistake, it can still emulate sound cards for retro-PC beeps and boops. Its not just the Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) from which the project took its name, but Sound Blaster 2.0, MPU-401 for MIDI, Tandy 3-voice, and CMS/GameBlaster are all soft options. Like most sound cards back in the day, PicoGUS provides game port support as well.\n\nWe dont recall sound cards that served as CD-ROM controllers, but apparently, that was a thing before IDE became the standard for optical drives. We do recall old CD-ROM drives that shipped with proprietary driver boards, and PicoGUS emulates Panasonics MKS standard, which apparently did show up on some sound cards. For the end-user, that doesnt matter much: once its all set up using the open-source utilities (and appropriate drivers), youll have an optical drive sitting at D:.\nTheres a USB port on the PicoGUS that lets you use a FAT32 formatted USB stick not as a CD drive, but a CD changer. You can access multiple disk images from the drive, selecting them with the utility software. Theres even a feature that lets you automatically advance to the next disk by removing and reinserting the drive, which is invaluable for multi-CD game installers. Its not super speedy: in USB mode, expect it to run as fast as a 4x drive. (2x if the PicoGUS is emulating a Sound Blaster at the same time.) Considering thats all with a single RP2040 in charge, its pretty fast. For a DOS box, its probably period appropriate, too.\nThe Almighty Algorithm reminded us about PicoGUS in a video by [vswitchero], which is embedded below for those of you who would like more information in the form of rapidly flickering images and sound.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044CD-ROM\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01RP2040 ISA\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300cPicoGUS 2.0\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "PicoGUS 2.0\u304cCD-ROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3001USB\u3067\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u753b\u50cf\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044CD-ROM\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01RP2040 ISA\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u300cPicoGUS 2.0\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u97f3\u58f0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff01PicoGUS\u304cCD-ROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30edPC\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\uff1aPicoGUS\u3067CD-R\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u642d\u8f09\uff01PicoGUS\u306b\u3088\u308bCD\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3078\uff1aPicoGUS\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb"]}

In todays installment of the Logg Dogg series, [Wes] summarizes weeks of agony over creating a custom circuit based around a microcontroller, a joystick and a lot of relays and other bits and pieces to drive the solenoids inside the logging machine that control the hydraulics.\nGiving the remote controller a bench test before connecting to the logging robot (Credit: Watch Wes Work)\nMost of the struggle was actually with the firmware, as it had to not only control the usual on/off solenoids, but also a number of proportional solenoid valves which control things like the track speed by varying the hydraulic flow to the final drives.\nThis requires a PWM signal, which [Wes] generated using two MOSFETs in a closed-feedback system, probably because open loop controls with multi-ton hydraulic machinery are not the kind of excitement most people look forward to.\nUltimately he did get it sorted, and was able to take the Logg Dogg for its first walk since being rescued from a barn, which both parties seemed to rather enjoy. The background details of this machine and the project can be found in our first coverage.\nWere looking anxiously forward to the next episode, where the controller goes wireless and the sketchiness gets dialed down some more.\n\n", "title": "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u56de\u8def\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "[Wes]\u306f\u30ed\u30b0\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6b20\u5982\u306b\u76f4\u9762\u3057\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3001\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3001\u30ea\u30ec\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u56de\u8def\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u7df4\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002PWM\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bMOSFET\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u554f\u984c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u56de\u8def\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30dd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u30bd\u30ec\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306ePWM\u4fe1\u53f7\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30e2\u30b9\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9589\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u69cb\u7bc9\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u671f\u5f85"]}

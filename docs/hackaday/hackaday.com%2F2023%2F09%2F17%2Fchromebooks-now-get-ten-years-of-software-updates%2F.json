With the rise of the Chromebook, this has moved into larger devices, with schools and other institutions left with piles of essentially whats essentially e-waste.\nNow in a rare show of sense from a tech company, Google have announced that Chromebooks are to receive ten years of updates from next year. Even better, it seems that this will be retroactively applied to at least some older machines, allowing owners to opt in to further updates for the remainder of the decade following the machines launch.\nOf course, a Chrome OS upgrade on an older machine wont make it any quicker. Were guessing many users will feel the itch up upgrade their hardware long before their decade of software support is up. But anything which saves e-waste has to be applauded, and since this particular scribe has a five-year-old ASUS Transformer just out of support, were hoping for a chance to jump back on that train.\nTheres another question though, and it relates to the business model behind Chromebooks. We doubt that the hardware manufacturers are thrilled at their customers old machines receiving a new lease of life and we doubt Google are doing this through sheer altruism, so were guessing that the financial justification comes from an extra five years of making money from the users data."}

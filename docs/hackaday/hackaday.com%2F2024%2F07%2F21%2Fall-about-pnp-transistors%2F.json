As [Aaron Danner] points out, many people think PNP transistors are backward but they have an important role to play in many circuits. He explains it all in a recent video you can see below.\nHe does explain why PNP transistors dont perform as well as corresponding NPN transistors, but they are still necessary sometimes. Once you get used to it, they are no problem to handle at all. Common cases where you want a PNP are, for example, when you want to switch a voltage instead of a ground. There are also certain amplifier configurations that need PNP units.\nLike an NPN transistor, a PNP can operate in saturation, linear operation, reverse active, or it can be cut off. [Aaron] shows you how to bias a transistor and youll see it isnt much different from an NPN except the base-emitter diode junction is reversed.\nAs you might expect, current has to flow through that diode junction to turn the transistor on. The arrow points in the direction of the diode junction. If you want a refresher on transistor biasing, we got you. Sure, you dont need to do it every day now, but it still is a useful skill to have.\n\n", "title": "PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u5f79\u5272", "body": "PNP\u30d0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306f\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001NPN\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3068\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002PNP\u306f\u3001\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u304d\u3084\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u69cb\u6210\u306a\u3069\u3067\u5f79\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002 biasing\u3084\u52d5\u4f5c\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3082NPN\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u5f79\u5272", "PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u52d5\u4f5c", "PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u65b9\u6cd5", "PNP\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3068NPN\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

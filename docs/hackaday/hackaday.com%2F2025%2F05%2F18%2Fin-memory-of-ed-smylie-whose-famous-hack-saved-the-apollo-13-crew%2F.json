Ed died recently, on April 21, in Crossville, Tennessee, at the age of 95.\n\nThis particular hack, another in the long and storied history of duct tape, literally required putting a square peg in a round hole. After an explosion on the Apollo 13 command module the astronauts needed to escape on the lunar excursion module. But the lunar module was only designed to support two people, not three.\nThe problem was that there was only enough lithium hydroxide onboard the lunar module to filter the air for two people. The astronauts could salvage lithium hydroxide canisters from the command module, but those canisters were square. Ed and his team famously designed the required adapter from a small inventory of materials available on the space craft. This celebrated story has been told many times, including in the 1995 film, Apollo 13.\nThank you, Ed, for one of the greatest hacks of all time. May you rest in peace.\nHeader: Gas conduit adapter designed by Ed Smylie, NASA, Public domain."}

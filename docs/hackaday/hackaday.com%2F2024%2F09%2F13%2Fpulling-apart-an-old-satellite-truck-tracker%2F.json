[saveitforparts] does just that, and recently came across a curious satellite system from a surplus store. What else could he do, other than tear it down and try to get it humming?\u00a0\nThe device appeared to be satellite communication device for a tracking unit of some sort, complete with a long, thick proprietary cable. That led to a junction box with a serial port and an RJ45 port, along with some other interfaces. Disassembly of the unit revealed it contained a great deal of smarts onboard, including some kind of single-board computer. Comms-wise, it featured a cellular GPRS interface as well as an Orbcomm satellite modem. It also packed in GPS, WiFi, Xbee, Ethernet, and serial interfaces. It ultimately turned out to be a Digi ConnectPort X5 device, used as a satellite tracking system for commercial trucks.\nWhats cool is that the video doesnt just cover pulling it apart. It also dives into communicating with the unit. [saveitforparts] was able to power it up and, using the manufacturers software, actually talk to the device. He even found the web interface and tested the satellite modem.\nUltimately, this is the kind of obscure industry hardware that most of us would never come into contact with during our regular lives. Its neat when these things show up on the secondary market so hackers can pull them apart and see what makes them tick. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u89e3\u4f53\u3057\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8abf\u3079\u308b\u559c\u3073\u3002[saveitforparts]\u306f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u885b\u661f\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u3001\u89e3\u4f53\u3057\u3066\u52d5\u4f5c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3002\u885b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u3068\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u767a\u898b\u3060\u3068\u5171\u6709\u3002", "titles": ["\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u53ce\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u901a\u4fe1\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u89e3\u4f53\u3068\u518d\u7a3c\u50cd", "\u5546\u7528\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u5411\u3051\u306e\u885b\u661f\u8ffd\u8de1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u89e3\u5256\u3059\u308b", "Digi ConnectPort X5\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u89e3\u6790", "\u7523\u696d\u7528\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4e2d\u8eab\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

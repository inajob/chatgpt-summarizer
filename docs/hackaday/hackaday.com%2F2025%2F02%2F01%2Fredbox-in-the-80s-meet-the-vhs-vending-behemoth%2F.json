Its an idea so simple its almost surprising it didnt appear sooner. Only, it did\u2014all the way back in the VHS age!\nMeet the Video Vendor. YouTuber [SpaceTime Junction] was able to track down one of these rare machines, which apparently formerly served an Ohio rental outlet called Kohnens. Its a monstrous thing that stands taller and about three times wider than traditional vending machines, and it could hold up to 320 tapes in its robotic magazine. Its got lashings of woodgrain, a green-on-black CRT, and the beautiful kind of clicky keys that went away after the 1980s.\n[SpaceTime Junction] has a bunch of videos up on the machine, and you even get to see it powered up.\u00a0 Its a little difficult to see whats going on, because the machine is something like nine feet wide and its all shot in vertical video. There isnt a whole lot of content on these obscurities out there, so this is a great place to start. Apparently, there were recently a hundred or more of these found living in a Texas warehouse according to Reddit, so we might see more of these popping up online soon. [SpaceTime Junction] has toured that facility, too.\nYou can read more about the fall of Redbox, or the cleanup afterwards, in our prior coverage.\n\n\n"}

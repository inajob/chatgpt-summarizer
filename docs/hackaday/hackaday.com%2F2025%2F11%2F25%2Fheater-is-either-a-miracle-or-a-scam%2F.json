Would you be shocked to learn that its heating capacity wasnt as advertised? No, we werent either. But [Clive] treats us to his usual fun teardown and analysis in the video below.\nA simple test shows that the heater drew about 800 W for a moment and drops as it heats until it stabilizes at about 300 W. Despite that, these units are often touted as 800 W heaters with claims of heating up an entire house in minutes. Inside are a fan, a ceramic heater, and two PCBs.\nThe ceramic heaters are dwarfed by metal fins used as a heat exchanger. The display uses a clever series of touch sensors to save money on switches. The other board is what actually does the work.\n[Clive] was, overall, impressed with the PCB. A triac runs the heaters and the fan. It also includes a thermistor for reading the temperature.\nYou can learn more about the power supply and how the heater measures up in the video. Suffice it to say, that a cheap heater acts like a cheap heater, although as cheap heaters go, this one is built well enough.\n\n", "title": "- \u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u3068\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u00a38\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "body": "Clive\u304c8\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u672a\u6e80\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3002\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306f300W\u3067\u3001\u5e83\u544a\u901a\u308a\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u3068\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u00a38\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u3068\u89e3\u6790", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\uff1a\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068PCB\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- 800W\u306e\u8b33\u3044\u6587\u53e5\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u304b\uff1f\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u71b1\u6e90\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "- \u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u512a\u308c\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\uff1a\u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u8a55\u4fa1"]}

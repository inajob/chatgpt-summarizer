This led them to explore the concept of shielding, and how a bit of well-placed metal can make all the difference in this regard.\nThe video focuses on three common types of shielding\u2014absorber sheets, shielding tapes, and shielding cabinets. A wide variety of electronic devices use one or more of these types of shielding. [GreatScott] shows off their basic effectiveness by putting various types of shielding in between a noise source and a near-field probe hooked up to a receiver. Just placing a bit of conductive material in between the two can cut down on noise significantly. Then, a software defined radio (SDR) was busted out for some more serious analysis. [GreatScott] shows how Faraday cages (or simple shielding cabinets] can be used to crush down spurious RF outputs to almost nothing, and how his noisy buck-boost designs can be quieted down with the use of the right absorber sheets that deal well with the problematic frequencies in question. The ultimate upshot of the tests is that higher frequencies respond best to conductive shielding that is well enclosed, while lower frequency noise benefits from more absorptive shielding materials with the right permeability for the job.\nShielding design can be a complex topic that you probably wont master in a ten minute YouTube video, but this content is a great primer if youre new to the topic. Weve covered the topic before, too, particularly on how a bit of DIY shielding can really aid a cheap SDRs performance. Video after the break.\n\n"}

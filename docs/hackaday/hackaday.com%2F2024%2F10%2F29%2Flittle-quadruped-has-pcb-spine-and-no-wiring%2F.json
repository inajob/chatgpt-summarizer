[Eric Yufeng Wu] sidestepped the wiring issue by creating Q8bot, a little quadruped where all the components, including the actuators, are mounted directly on the PCB.\n[Eric] uses a custom PCB as the spine of the robot, and the eight servos plug directly into connectors on the PCB. With their bottom covers removed, the servos screw neatly into a pair of 3D printed frames on either side of the PCB, which also have integrated 14500 battery holders. The PCB is minimalist, with just the XIAO ESP32C3 module, a boost converter circuit to drive the servos, and a battery fuel gauge. Each SCARA-style leg consists of four SLS 3D printed segments, with press-fit bearings in the joints.\nThe little one moves quickly, and can even do little jumps. For this prototype, most of the control processing is done on a laptop, which sends raw joint angles to the onboard ESP32 via the ESP-Now protocol. We think this little robot has a lot of development potential, and fortunately [Eric] has made all the hardware and software files available for others to build their own.\n\n", "title": "- \u914d\u7dda\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\uff01Q8bot\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u56db\u8db3\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8Q8bot\u306f\u3001PCB\u306b\u5168\u3066\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u914d\u7dda\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3002", "titles": ["- \u914d\u7dda\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\uff01Q8bot\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u56db\u8db3\u6b69\u884c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30c0\u30a4\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u52d5\u304d\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3044\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u516c\u958b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aQ8bot\u306e\u5168\u8c8c"]}

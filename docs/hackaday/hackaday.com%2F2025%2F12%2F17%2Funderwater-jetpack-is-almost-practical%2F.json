Who wants to cook their legs with hot exhaust while careening out of control? Nobody. Yet its such an iconic idea, we cant get away from it. What if there was a better environment, one where your jetpack dreams could come true? [CPSdrone] has found one: the worlds oceans, and have taken that revelation to build the worlds fastest underwater jetpack.\nUnderwater? Yeah, water drag is worse than air drag. But there are two big advantages: one, humans are fairly buoyant, so you dont need fight gravity with rocket thrust, and two, the high density of water makes small, electric props a reasonable proposition. The electric ducted fans on this jetpack each produce about 110 pounds of thrust, or just over 490 N. The first advantage is helped further by the buoyancy provided by the air-filled hull of the jetpack. Thats necessary because while the motors might be rated for submersion, but the rest of the electronics arent.\nAlas, wearing the device on the back is considerably less hydrodynamic than hanging on behind in the standard water scooter configuration. While theyre able to go faster than a swimming human, the ESCs werent able to handle the motors full power so we cant tell you if this device would allow [CPSdrone] to outrun a shark with those 220 lbf on tap, which was the design goal. Apparently theyre working on it.\nFrom the testing done on-screen, its safe to say that theyd at least need to hang on behind to get their desired speed goals, and abandon their jet pack dreams just as we landlubbers were forced to do long ago. Well, some of us, anyway.\n\n"}

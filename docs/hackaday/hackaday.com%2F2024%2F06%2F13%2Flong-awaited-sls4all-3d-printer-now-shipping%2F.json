Finally, version one is complete, with a parts kit ready to ship and all design data ready for download if a DIY build or derivative is your style. As some already mentioned, this is not going to be cheap: with the full parts kit running at an eye-watering $7K before tax. But its possible to build or source almost all of it a bit at a time for those on a budget.\nTry printing THIS benchy on an FDM machine!\nIts important to note that to access the detailed information, youll need to create an account, which is a bit inconvenient for an open source design. However, all the essential components seem to be available, so its forgivable. In terms of electronics, there are two custom PCBs: the GATE1 (GAlvo and Temperature Control) and the ZERO1 (Zero-crossing dimming) controller. Other than that, all the electronics seem to be standard off-the-shelf components. Both of these PCBs are designed using EasyEDA.\nUnfortunately we couldnt find access to the PCB Gerbers, nor does there appear to be a link to their respective EasyEDA projects, just the reference schematics. This is a bit of a drawback, but its something that could easily be reproduced with enough motivation. Control is courtesy of a Radxa Rock Pi, as there were problems with a Raspberry Pi. This is paired with a 7-inch touchscreen to complete the UI. This is running a highly modified version of the Klipper together with their own control software, which is still undergoing testing before release.\nThe laser head is built around a 10 W 450 nm laser module from China and a high-end galvanometer set. Two 200 W halogen tube heaters heat the print bed, and 200 W silicone heating pads heat both the powder bed and the print bed.\n\nSLS printing has its own unique idea of a build plate\nThe upper and lower frames are basic boxes made from 2020 profile aluminium extrusions, with aluminium sheets for the panels. There are no big surprises here. As expected, numerous custom-made aluminium parts are involved, and this is where most of the cost lies. This might be a significant challenge for those who dont have access to a CNC milling machine. The mechanics can be viewed in-browser via Fusion 360 Live or downloaded as a STEP model for later import.\nWe last checked in on this project back in 2022, and were glad to see it finally cross the finish line. Is this the first open source SLS printer? Of course not! But were always glad to see more options out there.\n"}

While online file storage systems like Dropbox and Google Drive have taken over a large percentage of the former task from USB drives, they have not been able to act as bootable media, ensuring that each of us have a few jump drives lying around. That might not be the case anymore, though, as this guide is the first we know of to be able to use Google Drive to boot to a Linux system.\nUnlike the tried-and-true jump drive methods, however, this process is not straightforward at all. It relies on two keys, the first of which is FUSE which allows a filesystem to be created in userspace. The second is exploiting a step in boot process of Linux systems where the kernel unpacks a temporary filesystem, called initramfs, in order to load the real filesystem. Normally a user doesnt interact much with this step, but that doesnt mean its impossible. A tool called dracut allows using an existing Linux installation to build a custom initramfs and in this case, the custom initramfs is built to include the proper support for both networking and FUSE.\nThe proof of concept in this demonstration originally ran in a container, using an existing project called google-drive-ocamlfuse to interact with Google Drive itself. From there, after sorting out some issues with root access, networking, malfunctioning symlinks, and various timeouts on the (perhaps predictably) slow system, the whole contraption was moved over to a laptop so it could be tested on real hardware. Everything runs, and although the original creator of this behemoth admits it is a bit silly they note that there may be some real-world use cases for something like this. We still wont expect everyone to throw out their jump drives anytime soon, though. If youre not feeling like your Linux skills are up to the challenge of something like this, wed recommend you start with our own [Al Williams]s Linux Fu series.", "title": "Google Drive\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "USB\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u8ee2\u9001\u3084\u4ed6\u306eOS\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3002\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u7528\u9014\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3068\u306a\u308a\u3001Google Drive\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLinux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["Google Drive\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Google Drive\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fLinux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8d77\u52d5\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "FUSE\u3068initramfs\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fGoogle Drive\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLinux\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u624b\u6cd5", "Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0initramfs\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u3088\u308bGoogle Drive\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u624b\u9806\u3092\u8fbf\u308bGoogle Drive\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLinux\u30d6\u30fc\u30c8\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

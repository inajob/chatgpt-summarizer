Theres the anechoic chamber with its complete lack of echo, but at the other end of the scale, theres the echo chamber. Its normal in 2024 when searching for reverb to reach for a software plugin, but following the effect back through silicon, spring lines, and metal plates to the 1950s, we find an echo chamber as a real room with a speaker and a microphone placed in it. [Rick Beato] takes us into the echo chamber, starting with one of the few remaining originals and probably the one whose effect has been heard on the most highly-charting music, at the famous Abbey Road studio in London.\nThe video below the break is broadly in two parts, with the first concentrating on the Abbey Road chamber and the second showing how an empty room in a house can be used to make your own. Its aimed at musicians rather than hardware hackers but we think its one of those moments of crossover that readers might find interesting. We were particularly curious about the tall ceramic tubes in the Abbey Road chamber, designed to further break up the sound waves for a greater depth of reverb.\nThe video shows how reverb can be achieved with just a room, but dont worry if youre space limited. A plate reverb neednt break the bank. Or, grab a spring.\n\n"}

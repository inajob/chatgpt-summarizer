If one is checking out old televisions or CRTs, firing up a test pattern can be a pretty handy way to see if the hardware is healthy or not.\nThe little white add-on you see attached to the yellow portion is a simple circuit (two resistors and an RCA jack) that allows the microcontroller to output a composite video signal. All one needs to do is power on the device, then press the large button to cycle through test patterns. A small switch on the side toggles between NTSC and PAL video formats. Its adorable, and makes good use of the enclosures that came with the dev board and proto board.\nIn a pinch a hacker could use an original Raspberry Pi, because the original Pi notably included a composite video output. That feature made it trivial to output NTSC or PAL video to a compatible display. But [Nicholas]s device has a number of significant advantages: its small, its fast, it has its own battery and integrated charger, and the little color screen mirroring the chosen test pattern is a great confirmation feature.\nThis is a slick little device, and its not [Nicholas]s first test pattern generator. He also created a RP2040-based unit with a VGA connector, the code of which inspired a hackers home-grown test pattern generator that was used to service a vintage arcade machine."}

If one is checking out old televisions or CRTs, firing up a test pattern can be a pretty handy way to see if the hardware is healthy or not.\nThe little white add-on you see attached to the yellow portion is a simple circuit (two resistors and an RCA jack) that allows the microcontroller to output a composite video signal. All one needs to do is power on the device, then press the large button to cycle through test patterns. A small switch on the side toggles between NTSC and PAL video formats. Its adorable, and makes good use of the enclosures that came with the dev board and proto board.\nIn a pinch a hacker could use an original Raspberry Pi, because the original Pi notably included a composite video output. That feature made it trivial to output NTSC or PAL video to a compatible display. But [Nicholas]s device has a number of significant advantages: its small, its fast, it has its own battery and integrated charger, and the little color screen mirroring the chosen test pattern is a great confirmation feature.\nThis is a slick little device, and its not [Nicholas]s first test pattern generator. He also created a RP2040-based unit with a VGA connector, the code of which inspired a hackers home-grown test pattern generator that was used to service a vintage arcade machine.", "title": "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "Nicholas Murray\u88fd\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306f\u3001\u6620\u50cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u51fa\u529b\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u6620\u50cf\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- NTSC\u3068PAL\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u3092\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u5668", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\uff01\u30cb\u30b3\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

(Credit: Oleksiis Tech, YouTube)\nMarketplaces and e-waste recycling centers are practically overflowing with the things: ARM-based streaming TV boxes that run some  usually very outdated and compromised  version of Android. While you can use them for their promised streaming purposes, theyre invariably poorly optimized and often lie about their true hardware specifications. Which leaves the most important question: can you install Linux on these SBCs and use them as a poor mans Raspberry Pi alternative? The answer, according to [Oleksiis Tech] on YouTube is sorta.\nThe commonly seen X96Q clone Android TV box that [Oleksii] bought for $10 is a good example. The clone advertises itself as based on a quad-core Cortex-A53 AllWinner H313 SoC, like the genuine X96Q, but actually has a Rockchip RK3229 inside with correspondingly far lower performance. After you have determined what the actual hardware inside the box is, you can get a copy of Armbian for that particular SoC. Here, the Rk322x-box minimal image was used, with the box booting straight off an SD card. Some Android TV boxes require much more complicated methods to even boot off external media, so this was a lucky break.\n\nContinuing the hardware scam, it was advertised as having 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of Flash, but it actually has just 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of eMMC Flash. This was enough to get Armbian desktop up and running, but thats about all you can do on the desktop. Desktop application performance was atrocious, mostly due to the CPUs quad Cortex-A7 cores struggling to keep up.\nAs also suggested in the comments, the best use for these low-spec SBCs is probably to run light server applications on them, including Pi-Hole, Samba, an IRC bouncer, and so on. Theyre pretty low-power, often have the requisite Ethernet built in, and it keeps another bit of potential e-waste from getting scrapped.\n", "title": "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306aH313 TV\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068Linux\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aAndroid TV\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u4f4e\u304f\u3001Linux\u5c0e\u5165\u306b\u306f\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u8efd\u4f5c\u696d\u5411\u304d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306aH313 TV\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068Linux\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u4e2d\u53e4\u306eAndroid TV\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u8a50\u6b3a\u3068\u771f\u5b9f\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- Raspberry Pi\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\uff1f\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u30c3\u30afSBC\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u9053\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- Android TV\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u306eArmbian\u5c0e\u5165\u6210\u529f\u3068\u305d\u306e\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u4f4e\u96fb\u529bSBC\u3067\u306e\u8efd\u91cf\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u904b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

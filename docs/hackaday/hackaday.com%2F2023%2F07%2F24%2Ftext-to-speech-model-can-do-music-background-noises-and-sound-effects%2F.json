It can even include non-speech sounds like laughter, sighs, throat clearings, and similar elements. But despite the fact that it can deliver such complex results, its important to understand some of the peculiarities.\nThe model takes a prompt and generates the resulting sound from scratch. Results might sometimes be unexpected.\nBark is not a conventional text-to-speech program, and how it works has a lot more in common with large language model AI chatbots. This means that results can deviate from expectations, and outputs arent necessarily going to be studio-quality speech. As the projects README points out, (generated outputs can) be anything from perfect speech to multiple people arguing at a baseball game recorded with bad microphones. That being said, there is some support for voice presets as a way to help guide the model with some consistency.\nBark was designed by a company called Suno\u00a0for research purposes and is available under the MIT License.\u00a0It can be installed and run locally, and has some demos available as well as an online implementation.\nThe ability to install and run Bark locally is promising territory for incorporating it into projects. And should you be more interested in speech-to-text instead, dont forget about this plain C/C++ implementaion of AI-powered speech recognition."}

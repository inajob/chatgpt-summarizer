However, theres nothing saying you cant build your own MIDI controllers that use the magic of breath to do their musical duty. Thats precisely what [Xavier Dumont] did with this unique 3D printed build.\nThe device looks somewhat like an alien ship from an animated 1960s sci-fi movie, but its actually a sophisticated MIDI controller. Naturally, its peppered with buttons as every good controller should be, and it features a touch-control strip on the back.\nHowever, the real magic is in the breath control. When the user blows into the sensor, the device sends out MIDI signals of varying intensity to control the object of the players desire. The breath signal can be used to modulate the mod wheel, pitch bends, or octave shifts, among a variety of other options.\n[Xavier] wields the instrument with prowess in the audio demos at the end of the video. We can imagine this futuristic thing being played by a background alien in a celebration scene in a far-flung Marvel movie. Or maybe Star Wars? In any case, a triumph.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044MIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306eMIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u3001\u606f\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3084\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u3001\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002\u606f\u306e\u5439\u304d\u8fbc\u307f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5f37\u5ea6\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u305fMIDI\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u9001\u4fe1\u3002 [Xavier Dumont]\u6c0f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c7\u30e2\u3082\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044MIDI\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u606f\u3092\u5439\u304f\u3068\u6f14\u594f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ab\u30c3\u30b3\u30a4\u30a4MIDI\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "MIDI\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u606f\u306e\u5f37\u3055\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "\u97f3\u697d\u7684\u306b\u6109\u3057\u3081\u308b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u306aMIDI\u697d\u5668", "\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u6620\u753b\u306b\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u305d\u3046\u306a\u3001\u606f\u3092\u5439\u3044\u3066\u6f14\u594f\u3059\u308bMIDI\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

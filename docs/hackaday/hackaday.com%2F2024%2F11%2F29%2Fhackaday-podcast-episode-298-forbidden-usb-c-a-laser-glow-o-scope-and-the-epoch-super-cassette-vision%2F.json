Starting with the weeks news, those Redbox vending machines continue to capture the attention of hackers everywhere, and in the race to snag one before theyre carted off for recycling someone has provided the missing hardware manual in the form of a wiki. Europeans can only look on wistfully. Then theres the curious case of life on the asteroid sample, despite the best efforts of modern science those pesky earth bacteria managed to breach all their anti-contamination measures. Anyone whos had a batch of homebrew go bad feels their pain.\nThe week provided plenty of hacks, with the team being wowed by [Bitluni]s CRT-like laser projector, then the many ingenious ways to 3D-print a hinge, and perhaps one of the most unforgiving environments in the home for a piece of robotics. Meanwhile our appetite for cool stuff was sated by an entire family of Japanese games consoles wed never heard of, and the little voltage reference whose data sheet also had an audio amplifier circuit. Finishing up, our colleague Arya has many unorthodox uses for a USB-C cable, and we have a frank exchange of views about Linux audio.\nGive it a listen below and check out all the links, and by all means, give us a roasting in the comments!\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nDownload it your own self!\nEpisode 298 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nLife Found On Ryugu Asteroid Sample, But It Looks Very Familiar\nThere\u2019s Now A Wiki For Hacking Redbox Machines\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nLast weeks sound was Eurosignal, an old pager protocol on FM radio.\u00a0 Congrats [Niklas]!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nWould An Indexing Feature Benefit Your Next Hinge Design?\nThe Japanese Console You Maybe Haven\u2019t Heard Of\nA Laser With Mirrors Makes A CRT-like Display\nFlyback, Done Right\nDIY Pipe Inspector Goes Where No Bot Has Gone Before\nProgrammable Zener Is Really An IC\n[Ken Shirriff] Explains The TL431\nOde To The TL431, And A LiFePO4 Battery Charger\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nHomebrew Phosphorescence Detector Looks For The Glow In Everyday Objects\nYour Undocumented Project May Also Baffle People Someday\nE-Ink Screen Combined With Analog Dial Is Epic Win\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\nGetting Started In Laser Cutting\nEven Apple Get Their Parts Wrong Sometimes\nOLED Screen Mounting, Without The Pain\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nUSB-C For Hackers: Reusing Cables\nLinux Fu: Audio Network Pipes\nPipeWire, The Newest Audio Kid On The Linux Block\n"}

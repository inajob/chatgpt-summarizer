Were leaning toward the latter, but both seem equally likely.\nThis build is sort of a mash-up of two recent [mitxela] projects  his LED industrial piercing, which contributes the concept of light-up jewelry in general as well as the power supply and enclosure, and his tiny volumetric persistence-of-vision display, which inspired the (greatly downsized) LED matrix. The matrix is the star of the show, coming in at only 9 mm in diameter and adorned with 0201 LEDs, 52 in total on a 1 mm pitch. Rather than incur the budget-busting expense of a high-density PCB with many layers and lots of blind vias, [mitexla] came up with a clever workaround: two separate boards, one for the LEDs and one for everything else. The boards were soldered together first and then populated with the LEDs (via a pick-and-place machine, mercifully) and the CH32V003 microcontroller before being wired to the power source and set in the stud.\nEven though most of us will probably never attempt a build on this scale, there are still quite a few clever hacks on display here. Our favorite is the micro-soldering iron [mitxela] whipped up to repair one LED that went missing from the array. He simply wrapped a length of 21-gauge solid copper wire around his irons tip and shaped a tiny chisel point into it with a file. Well be keeping that one in mind for the future.\n\n\nThanks to [spacedog], [hackbyte], and everyone else who spied this one for us.", "title": "9mm LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u300cmitxela\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u6975\u5c0fLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30a4\u30e4\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u304b\u3001\u81ea\u8eab\u304c\u8a66\u307f\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u8a00\u53ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002LED\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6982\u5ff5\u3068\u3001LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u76db\u308a\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u5de5\u592b\u3092\u51dd\u3089\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["9mm LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "LED\u3068\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5c0f\u9053\u5177\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5f62 - \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u7d30\u90e8\u307e\u3067\u3053\u3060\u308f\u308b\u3001LED\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c", "\u4f5c\u308a\u624b\u306e\u5275\u9020\u6027\u304c\u5149\u308b: LED\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

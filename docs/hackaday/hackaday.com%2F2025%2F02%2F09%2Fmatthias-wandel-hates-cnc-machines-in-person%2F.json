Hes never had one either, so until now he couldnt really talk. But he had the parts on hand, so he built a wooden CNC router. It\u2019s lovely.\nThe router itself is what 3D printer folks would call a bed-slinger, and it\u2019s cobbled together out of scrap plywood. Some of the parts have extra holes drilled in them, but \u201cmeasure once, drill twice\u201d is our motto, so we\u2019re not one to judge. He spends a lot of time making \u201ccrash pads\u201d that keep the frame from destroying itself while he\u2019s building it \u2013 once the CNC is actually controlling things with the limit switches, we presume they won\u2019t be necessary, but their design is fun anyway.\nIf you\u2019re at all interested in CNC machines, you should give this video a watch. Not because it\u2019s done the \u201cright\u201d way, but because it\u2019s a CNC that\u2019s being built on a budget from first principles, by an experienced wood builder, and it\u2019s illuminating to watch him go. And by the end of the video, he is making additional parts for the machine on the machine, with all the holes in the right places, so he\u2019s already stepping in the right direction.\nHe doesn\u2019t love digital design and fabrication yet, though. If you\u2019re making one-offs, it probably isn\u2019t worth the setup time to program the machine, especially if you have all of his jigs and machines at your disposal. Still, we kind of hope he\u2019ll see the light.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first wooden CNC router we\u2019ve seen around these parts, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. If you want to go even more fundamental, [Homo Faciens]\u2019s series of CNC machines is a lovely mashup of paperclips and potential. Or, if refinement is more your style, this benchtop machine is the bee\u2019s knees.\n\n", "title": "- \u6728\u5de5YouTuber\u304c\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u6728\u88fdCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u6728\u5de5YouTuber\u304c\u6728\u88fdCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u91cd\u8996\u3067\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6728\u5de5YouTuber\u304c\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u6728\u88fdCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u6750\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u629c\u7fa4\u306eCNC", "- \u7d4c\u9a13\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u6728\u5de5\u8077\u4eba\u306b\u3088\u308bCNC\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u300c\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u300d\u3067\u5b89\u5168\u7b2c\u4e00\u306eCNC\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u62b1\u3048\u308b\u6728\u5de5\u8077\u4eba\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226"]}

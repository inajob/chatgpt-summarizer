His most recent, based on an RP2040 with two channels that ran at 100 MSps, put it on the order of plenty of commercially-available oscilloscopes at this sample rate but at a fraction of the price. He wanted to improve on the design though, making a smaller unit with a greatly reduced bill-of-materials and with a more streamlined design, so he came up with this STM32-based oscilloscope.\nThe goal of this project was to base as many of the functions around the built-in capabilities of the STM32 as possible, so in addition to the four input channels and two output channels running at 1 MHz, the microcontroller also drives a TFT display which has been limited to 20 frames per second to save processor power for other tasks. The microcontroller also has a number of built-in operational amplifiers which are used as programmable gain amplifiers, further reducing the amount of support circuitry needed on the PCB while at the same time greatly improving the scopes capabilities.\nIn fact, the only parts of consequence outside of the STM32, the power supply, and the screen are the inclusion of two operational amplifiers included to protect the input channels from overvoltage events. Its an impressive build in a small form factor, and wed say the design goal of keeping the parts count low has been met as well. If you do need something a little faster though, his RP2040-based oscilloscope is definitely worth checking out.\n\n", "title": "STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3067\u3059", "body": "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u70b9\u6570\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002TFT\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3084\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u76ee\u6a19\u306f\u9054\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u901f\u306a\u5834\u5408\u306b\u306fRP2040\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3082\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3067\u3059", "STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u306f\u30014\u3064\u306e\u5165\u529b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u30682\u3064\u306e\u51fa\u529b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059", "STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3067\u3059", "STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u5185\u8535\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059", "STM32\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059"]}

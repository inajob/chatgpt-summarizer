The business was going well until it wasnt anymore, and then the company went bankrupt in July this year. And yet the machines live on. At least, thats according to YouTuber [Smokin Silicon], who spotted some remaining Redbox kiosks out and about. Including at his local Walmart!\nHeres the thing. Theres not one big switch at Redbox that turns all the machines off, and even if there was\u2014nobody hit it the moment the company declared bankruptcy. Thus, when [Smokin Silicon] rocked up to Walmart, he was able to flick through the movies and even add one to cart for purchase. However, trying to complete the transaction failed\u2014the kiosk eventually reported itself as out of service. That makes sense\u2014youd expect payment processing to be the first thing to go down.\nHowever, other Redbox kiosks were different. A kiosk at a Food Lion location actually still worked\u2014and [Smokin Silicon] was able to complete the transaction and walk away with a Black Adam disc! On a second trip, he was able to walk away with even more!\nThe rest of the video dives into Redbox lore and other posts online about the status of the company, software, and hardware. Apparently, someone on Reddit was claiming they had the Redbox kiosk OS available. Meanwhile, some users have had trouble returning their discs because the company is now defunct. However, [Smokin Silicon] was able to return his without issue. Ultimately, though, he recommends his viewers to go out and score as many DVDs and Blu Rays as possible from the machines since soon enough, theyll be gone forever.\nThe fact is, businesses are big and Kafkaesque, the kiosks are scattered all over the country, and so its anybodys guess if and when they stop working. Back when this website began, a redbox was something different entirely. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to\u00a0Hari Wiguna for the tip!]"}

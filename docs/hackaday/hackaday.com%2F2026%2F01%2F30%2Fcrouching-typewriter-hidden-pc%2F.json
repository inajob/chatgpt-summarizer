As the 20th century wore on, the typewriter became electric before eventually being eclipsed by luggable and laptop computers. On YouTube, [Prototype] is turning back the clock, by turning an old Smith-Corona electric typewriter into a luggable computer with a stretch goal of still being able to type.\nYeah, just gutting the typewriter and shoving an SBC inside wasnt ambitious enough for [Prototype]: his goal is a working typewriter and an x86 gaming PC. To facilitate this, he guts the Smith-Corona keyboard, and 3D-prints a new top plate to add a little more vertical space in the old typewriter. The new top does recreate the original layout and the Corona switches get printed adapters to fit them to mechanical switches [Prototype] is using with a vibe-coded Arduino. Why one would bother with ChatGPT when QMK is right there, we could not say, but feel free to skip 6:20 to 15:00 if youre watching the video but want to avoid that side quest.\nUnfortunately, the get the keyboard working side-quest is either faked or deferred to video part II, which has not been posted yet. In this video he demonstrates that he can actuate a single hammer with a servo, but thats a far cry from a working typewriter so, were really hoping he comes through on that promise in Part Two. Even if the build stops with just one hammer, that would give the tactile sound-and-feel that other builds turn to solenoids for. Squeezing a small-form-factor motherboard and graphics card into the old Smith-Corona is also going to be an interesting challenge. Its certainly going to be a step up from using the keyboard as a terminal.\nIf you like this project but balk at the idea of destroying a working piece of vintage office equipment, it is possible to turn a typewriter into a USB keyboard non-invasively.\u00a0\nIf you like this project at all, join us in thanking [Katie] for the tip.

Tell us what is, with a tip of your own.\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u5178\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3067\u518d\u751f\uff01\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30e9\u30b0\u30e9\u30d6\u30ebPC\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001PC\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u3046\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u6210\u529f\u3092\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u5178\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u3067\u518d\u751f\uff01\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30e9\u30b0\u30e9\u30d6\u30ebPC\u306b\u5909\u8eab", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u30fb\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0PC\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff01\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b[Prototype]\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u518d\u73fe\uff1f\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u5b88\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

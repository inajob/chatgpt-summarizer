One of them has crossed the bench of [Jazzy Jane], its a current dumping amplifier from the mid-1980s. A nicely-done home-made project on stripboard mounted on a wooden base board, it sports a power supply, RIAA pre-amp board, and the amplifier itself.\nThe current dumping amplifier is one that combines a small class A amplifier with a hefty class B one, and through feedback trickery uses the combination to remove the crossover distortion of the class B stage. Its a simple yet elegant circuit with fewer parts than an equivalent class AB amplifier, and there was a time back in the day when it was all the rage. This one has an op-amp providing the class A part and a complimentary pair of Darlington pairs as the class B.\nThe video below the break shows the process of bringing the amp back to life, a process mostly concerned with the power supply. There are a set of tantalum capacitors which have failed, and the replacements shes using turn out to have problems too. Theyre a period part for a project of this age, but we might have been tempted to go for another capacitor type here.\nThe result is an unusual amplifier, brought back to life. You may have seen [Jane] feature here before, with her 1950s signal generator.\n\n"}

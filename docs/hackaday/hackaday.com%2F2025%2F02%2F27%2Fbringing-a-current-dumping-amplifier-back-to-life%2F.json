One of them has crossed the bench of [Jazzy Jane], its a current dumping amplifier from the mid-1980s. A nicely-done home-made project on stripboard mounted on a wooden base board, it sports a power supply, RIAA pre-amp board, and the amplifier itself.\nThe current dumping amplifier is one that combines a small class A amplifier with a hefty class B one, and through feedback trickery uses the combination to remove the crossover distortion of the class B stage. Its a simple yet elegant circuit with fewer parts than an equivalent class AB amplifier, and there was a time back in the day when it was all the rage. This one has an op-amp providing the class A part and a complimentary pair of Darlington pairs as the class B.\nThe video below the break shows the process of bringing the amp back to life, a process mostly concerned with the power supply. There are a set of tantalum capacitors which have failed, and the replacements shes using turn out to have problems too. Theyre a period part for a project of this age, but we might have been tempted to go for another capacitor type here.\nThe result is an unusual amplifier, brought back to life. You may have seen [Jane] feature here before, with her 1950s signal generator.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u300d", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u300c\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u300d\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u300d", "\u300c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u6b6a\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "\u300c\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b5\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u5b9f\u969b\uff1a\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u554f\u984c\u70b9\u300d"]}

[Abe] missed some of the charm of earlier, lower-quality digital cameras, though, and wanted to recreate that experience. The way forward was obvious. He built a nostalgic digital video camera from scratch!\n[Abe] figured he could build the entire project around analog gear, and then simply find a way to store the video digitally, thus creating the effect he was looking for. To that end, the build is based around a small analog video camera thats intended for use with FPV drones. It runs on 5 to 20 volts and outputs a simple composite video signal. This makes it easy to display its output on a small LCD screen, originally intended to be used with an automotive reversing camera. These were both paired with a mini video recorder module from RunCam, which can capture composite video and store it on a microSD card in 640 x 480 resolution.\nThese parts were quickly lashed together, with the camera sending its output to the RunCam video recorder module, which then passed it on to the screen. Everything worked as expected, so [Abe] moved on to implementing an on-screen display using the MAX7456 chip, which is built specifically for this purpose. It overlays text on the video feed to the screen as commanded by an RP2040 microcontroller. Once that was all working, [Abe] just had to provide a battery power supply and wrap everything up in a nice retro-styled case. Then, at the last minute, the separate camera and recorder modules were replaced by a TurboWing module that combined both into one.\nThe result is a nifty-looking camera that produces grainy, slurry, old-school digital video. If you love 640 x 480 as a resolution, youll dig this. Its got strong 90s camcorder vibes, and thats a very good thing.\nWe love a good custom camera around these parts, especially those that offer deliciously high resolution. If youre building your own, be sure to let us know. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "Abe\u306f\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\u306e640x480\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306e\u6620\u50cf\u304c\u9b45\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u6210", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "FPV\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "MAX7456\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30f3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6a5f\u80fd", "90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u98a8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u4f8b"]}

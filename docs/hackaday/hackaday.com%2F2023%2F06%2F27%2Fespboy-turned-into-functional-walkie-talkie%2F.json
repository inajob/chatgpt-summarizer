However, its also a platform that can readily support all kinds of other uses. You can even turn the humble handheld device into a working walkie talkie.\nThe build relies on adding a SA868 transceiver module to the ESPBoy, along with a microphone, speaker, audio amplifier and antenna as supporting hardware. It then relies on the ESPBoys existing screen and buttons as a user interface for the radio. Assembled appropriately, it can then be used as a very basic and barebones walkie talkie for voice communication.\nYou wont get coded squelch or other useful features, but its enough to let you talk over the air with other handheld radio users. The SA868 module can transmit on a variety of frequency bands, but the video shows it operating in the UHF band around 433 MHz. With a power on the order of 1.8W, it should get you a few kilometers of transmission range in an open field.\nCheck out our earlier coverage of the ESPBoy and its many different configurations. Video after the break.\n\n"}

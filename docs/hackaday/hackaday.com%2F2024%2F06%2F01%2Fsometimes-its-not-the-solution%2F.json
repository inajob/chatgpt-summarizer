Sometimes I like reading about hackers\u2019 projects more for the description of the problem they\u2019re facing.\nA good problem invites you to brainstorm along. In the case of [Marco Reps]\u2019s switches, for instance, they need to be extraordinarily temperature stable, which means being made out of a single type of metal to avoid unintentional thermocouple joints. And ideally, they should be as cheap as possible. Once you see one good solution, you can\u2019t help but think of others \u2013 just reading the comments on that article shows you how inspiring a good problem can be. I\u2019m not worried about these issues in any of my work, but it would be cool to have to.\nSimilarly, this week, I really liked [Michael Prasthofer]\u2019s deep dive into converting a normal camera into a spectrometer. His solutions were all very elegant, but what was most interesting were the various problems he faced along the way. Things that you just wouldn\u2019t expect end up mattering, like diffraction gratings being differently sensitive across the spectrum when light comes in from different angles. You can learn a lot from other people\u2019s problems.\nSo, hackers everywhere, please share your problems with us! You think that your application is \u201ctoo niche\u201d to be of general interest? Maybe it\u2019s another example of a problem that\u2019s unique enough to be interesting just on its own. Let\u2019s see what your up against. A cool problem is at least as interesting as a clever solution.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

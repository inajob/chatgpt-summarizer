The idea is that when you\u2019re building something truly new, or even just new to you, your first take will almost always be ugly, and nothing will work the way it will by the time you make your second one. But it\u2019s also important to the exercise that you see it all the way through to the end if you can.\nI\u2019m reminded of this after seeing a marvelous video by [Japhy Riddle] where he discusses his Prototype Zero of the Tape-Speed Keyboard. About halfway through the video he says that he would have done it totally differently if he knew then what he knows now: the hallmark of Prototype Zero. Yet he finishes it up, warts and all, documents it, and plays around with all of its possibilities. (Documenting it publicly isn\u2019t part of the Prototype Zero method.)\nI don\u2019t think that [Japhy] is going to make a Prototype 1.0 out of this project, but I could be wrong; he seems to be content with having scratched the variable-speed tape itch. But if he did want to, he\u2019s learned all of the gotchas on the engineering side, and found out exactly what such an instrument is capable of. And this loops back to the importance of getting Prototype Zero finished. You may have learned all of the tricks necessary to build the thing even before you\u2019ve put the last screw in, but it\u2019s when you actually have the thing in your hands to explore that you get the ideas for refinement that you simply can\u2019t think up when it\u2019s still just a concept.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to make your prototype quick and dirty, because if it ends up too dirty, you can just call it Prototype Zero. But don\u2019t be tempted by the siren\u2019s song of the 80% finished prototype either. Exploring putting Prototype Zero into use is its real purpose.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

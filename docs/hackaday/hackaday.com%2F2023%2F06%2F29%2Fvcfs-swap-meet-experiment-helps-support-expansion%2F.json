But with the rise of websites like eBay and Craigslist these parking lot meetups started to fall out of favor, to the point that they became all but extinct over the last couple decades.\nSo there was some risk involved when the Vintage Computer Federation decided to dust off the concept as a way of sidestepping New Jerseys COVID-era limitations on indoor meetups. But as VCF Vice President [Jeffery Brace] explained during our visit earlier this month, the experiment has more than paid off. Each swap meet has brought in buyers and sellers from all over the Mid\u2013Atlantic region, helping to not only raise money for the VCFs ongoing preservation efforts, but spread awareness of the organization and their goals.\nThe VCF hopes to expand their existing museum.\nDuring our chat, [Jeffery] goes over the origins and growth of the VCF swap meet, and how it compares to their annual Vintage Computer Festival. He also speaks about the Federations desire to expand their already impressive museum space into a far larger climate-controlled area that will allow for even more classic computer hardware to be put on display.\nWe visited the inaugural VCF swap meet back in 2021, and came away with the distinct impression that [Jeffery] and the rest of the team had a winning idea on their hands. Were happy to report that as of 2023 the areas where we saw room for improvement  namely the lack of on-site refreshment and a somewhat overly narrow focus on vintage hardware  have both been addressed. In its current form, this is truly a must-see event for anyone with an interest in computers, radio, or even just general electronics who happens to live within driving distance of the Jersey shore.\nWhile eBay certainly makes it easy to bid on a piece of gear, youre unlikely to make a new friend while doing so. Events like this are more than just a way to buy and sell hardware, but provide a chance for like-minded individuals to connect and build a community. Were glad to see the event grow larger each year, and hope it inspires similar revivals elsewhere.\n\n"}

These cards are disposable, so whatever technology they use must be astonishingly cheap. Its one of these which [Ken Shirriff] has turned his microscope upon, a Montreal M\u00e9tro ticket, and his examination of the MiFare Ultra Light it contains is well worth a read.\nThe cardboard surface can be stripped away from the card to reveal a plastic layer with a foil tuned circuit antenna. The chip itself is a barely-discernible dot in one corner. For those who like folksy measurements, smaller than a grain of salt. On it is an EEPROM to store its payload data, but perhaps the most interest lies in the support circuitry. As an NFC chip this has a lot of RF circuitry, as well as a charge pump to generate the extra voltages to charge the EEPROM. In both cases the use of switched capacitors plays a part in their construction, in the RF section to vary the load on the reader in order to transmit data.\nHe does a calculation on the cost of each chip, these are sold by the wafer with each wafer having around 100000 chips, and comes up with a cost-per-chip of about nine cents. Truly cheap as chips!\nIf NFC technology interests you, weve taken a deep dive into their antennas in the past."}

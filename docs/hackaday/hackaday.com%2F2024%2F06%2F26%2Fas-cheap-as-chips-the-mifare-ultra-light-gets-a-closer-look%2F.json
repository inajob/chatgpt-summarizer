These cards are disposable, so whatever technology they use must be astonishingly cheap. Its one of these which [Ken Shirriff] has turned his microscope upon, a Montreal M\u00e9tro ticket, and his examination of the MiFare Ultra Light it contains is well worth a read.\nThe cardboard surface can be stripped away from the card to reveal a plastic layer with a foil tuned circuit antenna. The chip itself is a barely-discernible dot in one corner. For those who like folksy measurements, smaller than a grain of salt. On it is an EEPROM to store its payload data, but perhaps the most interest lies in the support circuitry. As an NFC chip this has a lot of RF circuitry, as well as a charge pump to generate the extra voltages to charge the EEPROM. In both cases the use of switched capacitors plays a part in their construction, in the RF section to vary the load on the reader in order to transmit data.\nHe does a calculation on the cost of each chip, these are sold by the wafer with each wafer having around 100000 chips, and comes up with a cost-per-chip of about nine cents. Truly cheap as chips!\nIf NFC technology interests you, weve taken a deep dive into their antennas in the past.", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30fb\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u306e\u4e57\u8eca\u5238\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308b", "body": "\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u591a\u304f\u306e\u90fd\u5e02\u3067\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u6a5f\u95a2\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u969b\u3001\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u96fb\u8eca\u3084\u30d0\u30b9\u306b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308bNFC\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u306e\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308bMiFare Ultra Light\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u691c\u8a3c\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u7d049\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30fb\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30e2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u306e\u4e57\u8eca\u5238\u304b\u3089\u898b\u308b", "\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u79d8\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\uff1a\u6700\u65b0\u306eNFC\u6280\u8853\u3092\u89e3\u5256", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u5947\u8de1\uff1a\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u7720\u308b\u6280\u8853", "\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u5909\u52d5\u6280\u8853\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30cb\u30a2\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff08NFC\uff09\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u306f", "\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30ca\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308bNFC\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

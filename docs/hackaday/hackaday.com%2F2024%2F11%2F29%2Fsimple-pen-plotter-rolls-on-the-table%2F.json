Theyre a great way to learn the fundamentals of motion control and make something useful along the way. In that vein, [Maker101] has created a neat barebones plotter for tabletop use.\u00a0\nThe basic design relies on familiar components. It uses a pair of MGN15 linear rails as the basis of the motion platform, along with NEMA 17 stepper motors to run the X and Y axes. These are assembled with the aid of 3D-printed parts that bring the whole frame together, along with a pen lifter operated with a hobby servo.\nThe neat thing about the design is that the barebones machine is designed to sit upon an existing tabletop. This eliminates the need to integrate a large flat work surface into the plotter itself. Instead, the X axis just runs along whatever surface you place it on, rolling on a small wheel. Its likely not ideal for accuracy or performance; we could see the machine itself skating around if run too fast. For a lightweight barebones plotter, though, it works well enough.\nIf you dig building plotters, you might like to step up to something more laser-y in future. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- DIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "DIY CNC\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u4e0a\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\uff01\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- MGN15\u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- NEMA 17\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fX\u8ef8\u30fbY\u8ef8\u306e\u5236\u5fa1", "- \u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u7c21\u6613\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u8efd\u91cf\u30da\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046\uff01"]}

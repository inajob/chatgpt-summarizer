The first thing you have you determine if it is going to be digital or analog. Or is it? If you build [Ivanek240267]s clock, you can have both.\nThe digital portion uses an OLED display. The analog portion contains two rings of smart LEDs. The WiFi configuration is always an issue in projects like this, and this clock also offers options. In addition, the Raspberry Pi Pico-based clock also sets itself via NTP.\nYou can, of course, compile the WiFi credentials into the code, and assuming you dont plan on changing networks, thats fine. But if youre in a more dynamic situation, the clock can also read its configuration from a memory card.\nThe analog clock uses colors. The green LEDs represent quarter hours. The blue LEDs are for minutes, while the red ones are full hours. Of course, reading the OLED doesnt require any special interpretation.\nWhen debugging, the timing doesnt drive the smart LEDs. That means if you need to work on that part of the code, you wont be able to count on debugging support.\nWeve mentioned before that digital clocks are all analog, anyway. If you want to use fewer LEDs, you can get by with only five."}

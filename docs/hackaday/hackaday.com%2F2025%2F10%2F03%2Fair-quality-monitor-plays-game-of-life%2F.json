Its usually more helpful to have some kind of sensor that can tell you what the deal is. To that end, [Arnov Sharma] built a neat air quality monitor with a fun twist.\nA Raspberry Pi Pico W acts as the heart of the build, armed with an SGP40 gas sensor. This sensor is intended for monitoring total volatile organic compounds in the air, which can be a useful measure of air quality in at least one dimension. It reports a simple air quality score from 0 to 500, based on a 1-1000 ppm ethanol equivalent reading. Based on the sensors output, the Pi Pico drives an LED matrix display  setting it green for good quality air, yellow for moderate, and red for poor air quality (i.e. high VOC content). The fun part is that rather than just show a simple color, the display plays Conways Game of Life to create an animated visual. Wed love it even more if poor air quality lead to the premature death of individual cells, making it even more interactive.\nWeve featured other air quality monitors before; often, its desirable to monitor CO2 levels to determine whether more ventilation is needed.\n\n"}

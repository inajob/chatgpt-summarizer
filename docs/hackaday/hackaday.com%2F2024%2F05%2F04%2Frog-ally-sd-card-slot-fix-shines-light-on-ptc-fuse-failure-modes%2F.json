Recently, weve stumbled upon a Reddit post investigating a somewhat common failure mode of this handheld  the microSD card slot going out of order, where an inserted card fails to be recognized, pretty irritating to encounter. Now, it turns out, this is down to a certain model of PTC fuses being failure-prone.\nIt makes sense to fuse the SD card slot. The cards are dense pieces of technology that are subject to some wear and tear in daily use. As such, its not unheard of that a microSD card can short-circuit internally  heating up to the point of melting plastic and giving people severe burns. Given that such a card is typically connected to a beefy 3.3 V rail, any mass-manufactured device designer could want to put a fuse between the 3.3 V rail and the card. However, on some ROG Ally batches, a certain make of the fuse is used, that appears to be likely to develop faults: the fuses resistance increasing dramatically during the cards normal operation, with the SD card being supplied subpar power as a result.\nTheres a fair bit of investigating happening in the comment section, with people posting oscilloscope captures, using breakouts to tap the SD card, and figuring out the fuse part numbers for the affected models. As for Reddits solution, its short-circuiting the fuse with a piece of thin wire  we would probably source a suitable fuse and solder it on top of the faulty one.\nThis isnt the first ROG Ally modification weve covered so far, and given the activity were seeing, its unlikely to be our last.", "title": "ROG Ally\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8abf\u67fb", "body": "Asus ROG Ally\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6545\u969c\u304cmodding\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u3067\u8a71\u984c\u306b\u3002\u7570\u5e38\u306aPTC\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u305b\u3044\u3067SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u75c7\u72b6\u3002Reddit\u3067\u306e\u691c\u8a0e\u304b\u3089\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["ROG Ally\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8abf\u67fb", "ROG Ally\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "ROG Ally\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u8d77\u56e0\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u554f\u984c", "ROG Ally\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30ad\u30e3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "ROG Ally\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30edSD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u3042\u305f\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020"]}

What could be more personal than creating a font from your own handwriting? Thats what [Chris Smith] has done, and it looks great on his blog, which also has a post summarizing the process.\nLike most of us [Chris] tried to use open-source toolkits first, but the workflow (and thus the result) was a bit wanting. Still, he details what it takes to create a font in Inkscape or Font Forge if anyone else wants to give it a try. Instead he ended up using a web app called Calligraphr designed for this exact use case.\nAbove is hand written; below is the font. Aside from the lighting the difference isnt obvious.\nFair warning: the tool is closed-source and he needed to pay to get all the features he wanted  specifically ligatures, glyphs made from two joined letters. By adding ligatures his personalized font gets a little bit of variation, as the l in an lf ligature (for example) need not be identical to the stand-alone l. In a case of you get what you pay for the process worked great and to the credit of the folks at Calligraphr, while it is Software-As-Service they offer a one-time payment for one months use of the pro features. While nobody likes SaS, thats a much more user-friendly way to do it  or perhaps least-user-hostile.\nAll [Chris] had to do was write out and scan a few sheets that you can see above, while the software handled most of the hard work automagically. [Chris] only had to apply a few tweaks to get the result you see here. Aside from websites, we could see a personalized font like this being a nice touch to laser cut, CNC or even 3D printed projects. If you dont want a personalized touch, the Gorton lettering of retro machinery might be more to your liking.", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u624b\u66f8\u304d\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u624b\u66f8\u304d\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u306e\u8a71\u3002Calligraphr\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u500b\u6027\u7684\u306a\u5b57\u4f53\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u624b\u66f8\u304d\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Calligraphr\u3067\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b", "- \u624b\u66f8\u304d\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\uff1a\u500b\u6027\u7684\u306a\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304b\u3089\u30d7\u30ed\u4ed5\u69d8\u307e\u3067\uff1a\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- \u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u5370\u8c61\u306e\u5909\u5316"]}

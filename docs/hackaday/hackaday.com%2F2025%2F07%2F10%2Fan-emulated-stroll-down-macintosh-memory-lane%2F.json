Maybe it was the revolutionary classic of 1984 fame, perhaps it was the adorable G3 iMac in 1998, or even a shiny OS X machine in the 21st century. Whichever it is, youll find it emulated in [Marcin Wichary]s essay Frame of preference: A history of Mac settings, 1984\u20132004  an exploration of the control panel and its history.\nThats not a photograph, its an emulator. (At least on the page. Here, its a screenshot.)\n[Marcin] is a UI designer as well as an engineer and tech historian, and his UI chops come out in full force, commenting and critiquing Curputinos coercions. The writing is excellent, as youd expect from the man who wrote the book on keyboards, and it provides a fascinating look at the world of retrocomputing through the eyes of a designer. That design-focused outlook is very apropos for Apple in particular. (And NeXT, of course, because you cant tell the story of Apple without it.)\nThere are ten emulators on the page, provided by [Mihai Parparita] of Infinite Mac. Its like a virtual museum with a particularly knowledgeable tour guide  and its a blast, getting to feel hands-on, the design changes being discussed. Theres a certain amount of gamification, with each system having suggested tasks and a completion score when you finish reading. There are even Easter eggs.\nThis is everything we wish the modern web was like: the passionate deep-dives of personal sites on the Old Web, but enhanced and enabled by modern technology. If youre missing those vintage Mac days and dont want to explore them in browser, you can 3D print your own\u00a0full-size replica, or a doll-sized picoMac.\n"}

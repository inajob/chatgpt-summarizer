The video is below.\nOf course, this presupposes you have some way to display text on an oscilloscope. Audio driving the X and Y channels of the scope does all the work. We arent sure exactly how hes doing that, but we suspect it is something like Osci-Render.\nDoes this have any value other than art? Its hard to say. Perhaps the effect of panning audio on text might give you some insight into your next audio project. Incidentally, panning certainly did what you would expect it to do, as did the pass filters. But some of the effects were a bit surprising. We still want to figure out just whats happening with the wave folder.\nIf text isnt enough for you, try video. Filtering that would probably be pretty entertaining, too. If you want to try your own experiments, we bet you could do it all  wave generation and filtering  in GNU Radio.\n\n"}

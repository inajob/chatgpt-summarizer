This perhaps controversial statement is the open door that gets kicked in by [PKAE Electronics] over at YouTube, as he explains with excellent diagrams and simulations how exactly these ICs work, and what it takes to make it actually do timer things. For anyone who has ever used one of these chips there is probably nothing too mind-blowing, but its an infinitely better way to wrap your way around an NE555 and kin than a datasheet.\nAt its core, the 555 contains three 5 kOhm resistors as a voltage divider, which has been incorrectly postulated to be the source of the chips name. This voltage divider controls two comparators, which in turn control an SR flipflop. These comparators are used for the voltage trigger and threshold inputs, which in turn toggle the flipflop, respectively setting and resetting it. This by itself just means that the 555 can be used as a threshold detector, with settable control voltage. How a 555 becomes a timer is when the discharge, trigger and threshold pins are combined with external resistors and a capacitor, which creates a smooth square wave on the 555s output pin.\nThere are many ways to make basic components into an oscillator of some type, but the 555 is a great choice when you want something more refined that doesnt involve using an entire MCU. That said, theres far more that the 555 can be used for, as [PKAE] alludes to, and we hope that he makes more excellent videos on these applications.\n\n"}

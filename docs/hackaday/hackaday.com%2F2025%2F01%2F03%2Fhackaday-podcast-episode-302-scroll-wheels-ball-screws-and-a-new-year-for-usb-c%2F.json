Turns out, quite a bit. There was a lot to cover, but the big surprise was the Whats that Sound competition. Do you know who had the correct answer from the last show? No one! So they guys did the right thing and drew from all the entrants for a coveted Hackaday Podcast T-shirt.\nBack to the hacks, youll hear about USB-C and the EU, what to do when the Kickstarter product you had your heart set on doesnt deliver, and a very strange way to hack some power grids wirelessly.\nIf you are interested in physics cameras, modifying off-the-shelf gear, or a fresh approach to color 3D printing, theyll talk about that, too. Finally,\u00a0 you can find out what Tom Nardi thought of Hackaday in the year past, and if your next ocean voyage will have to stop for a charge.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the MP3 full of optimism for 2025 resolutions.\n\nEpisode 302 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nWhen The EU Speaks, Everyone Charges The Same Way\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Henr\u00e9 Botha] for winning the dice roll.

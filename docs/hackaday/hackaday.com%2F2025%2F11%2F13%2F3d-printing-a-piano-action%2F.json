Once a piano reaches that point, whether through age, use, or neglect, at that point its to intents and purposes worthless. But still, theyre essentially just machines. [Toast] figured that, since 3D printers not only can print all kinds of other machines and musical instruments alike, he would take a stab at combining these two and made his own 3D printed piano.\nA pianos action is the mechanical linkage between the keys and the strings of the piano themselves. Over many hundreds of years this has developed into a complicated series of levers which not only rapidly strike strings when a key is pressed, but also mute the strings while the key is not being pressed and strike the strings in a way that the hammer wont be pressed into the strings if the player leaves their finger on a key. Rather than try to recreate all of this in meticulous detail, [Toast] has swapped out the strings for a series of tubes which, unlike strings, do not much change their musical behavior if the hammer remains on the tube after being struck. This greatly simplifies the action (and cost) of his miniature piano.\nThe piano works by positioning hammers above these tubes, which strike downwards when a musician depresses the keys. Rubber bands return the hammers to their upright positions after the key is lifted. The instrument went through a few stages of design as well where [Toast] refined the size and shape of the tubes as well as improved the way by which the hammers are attached to the keys.\nIs it still a piano if it has pipes instead of strings? Perhaps, but at the very least we can all agree that hes built a working keyboard action capable of producing music, if not an outright definitionally-accurate piano. Its an interesting build that we hope to see more iterations of in the future, if not to build a more functionally accurate 3D printed piano action then to see what is possible from a 3D printer in the piano space. Despite their complexity and weight, pianos are a fundamental and popular instrument in the Western music tradition and weve seen many interesting builds around them like this modern player piano built with a series of solenoids.\n\nThanks to [Vert] for the tip!", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u5f62", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002\u5f26\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u697d\u5668\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u5f62", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u6a5f\u69cb\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3057\u305fDIY\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u5668\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u697d\u5668\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b"]}

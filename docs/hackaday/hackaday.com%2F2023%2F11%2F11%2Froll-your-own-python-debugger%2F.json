If you are on an old enough computer  or maybe one that has limited tools like some microcontrollers  debugging is largely an intellectual exercise. Try a program, observe its behavior, and then try again. You can liberally sprinkle print statements around if you have an output device or turn on LEDs or digital outputs if you dont. But with a debugger, you can get a birds-eye view of your programs data and execution flow.\nFor some languages, writing a debugger can be hard  you usually use at least some system facility to get started. But as [mostlynerdness] shows, Pythons interpreter wants to help you create your own debugger, and you can follow along to see how its done. This is accessible because Python has a built-in debugging core that you can use and extend. Well, regular Python, that is. MicroPython has some low-level support, and while weve seen attempts to add more, we havent tried it.\nOf course, you may never need to build your own debugger  most of the IDEs have already done this for you, and some of the code is, in fact, lifted from an open code base and simplified. However, understanding how the debugging plumbing works may give you a leg up if you need to create custom logic to trap an error that would be difficult to find with a generic debugger. Plus, it is just darn interesting.\nLike many Python things, there are some version sensitivities. The post is in four parts, with the last two dealing with newer API changes.\nWe cant promise that Python can debug your hardware, though. We always thought the C preprocessor was subject to abuse, but it turns out that Python has the same problem.", "title": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306f\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u53e4\u5178\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5206\u3051\u308b\u8981\u7d20\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6587\u3084LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u5b9f\u884c\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u3092\u5168\u4f53\u7684\u306b\u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002Python\u306f\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u81ea\u8eab\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002IDE\u304c\u65e2\u306b\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u306e\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001Python\u3067\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "titles": ["\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Python\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u304c\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u691c\u51fa\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u7406\u7531", "Python\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u30b3\u30a2\u3068API\u306e\u5909\u66f4\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2"]}

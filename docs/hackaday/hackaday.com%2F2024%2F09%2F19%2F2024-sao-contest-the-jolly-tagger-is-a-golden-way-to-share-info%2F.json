What could be cooler than sharing your contact information all over Supercon and beyond with a tap of a Jolly Wrencher? Its way better than just some sticker, and with the extra solder pad on the back, you can turn it into a pin once the con is over. Contact data can be uploaded over I\u00b2C.\nThe KiCad-generated coil.\nHere, [Phil Weasel] seeks to answer the question of whether one can make a working NFC tag with the M24LR04E IC, using a PCB trace as a coil. If there is an issue, its probably going to be that copper plane inside the antenna.\nDesigning the antenna itself proved fairly easy after checking the datasheet for the internal tuning capacitance (~27.5 pF), verifying the frequency of NFC (~13.56 MHz), and doing the math to find the inductance needed. After confirming everything in LTSpice, [Phil] used a PCB coil calculator and let the KiCad coil generator draw it out.\nDid we mention the Jolly Wrencher is backlit by four side-mounted LEDs? Because whats an SAO without a few blinkenlights?\n \n\n"}

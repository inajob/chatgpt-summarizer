What could be cooler than sharing your contact information all over Supercon and beyond with a tap of a Jolly Wrencher? Its way better than just some sticker, and with the extra solder pad on the back, you can turn it into a pin once the con is over. Contact data can be uploaded over I\u00b2C.\nThe KiCad-generated coil.\nHere, [Phil Weasel] seeks to answer the question of whether one can make a working NFC tag with the M24LR04E IC, using a PCB trace as a coil. If there is an issue, its probably going to be that copper plane inside the antenna.\nDesigning the antenna itself proved fairly easy after checking the datasheet for the internal tuning capacitance (~27.5 pF), verifying the frequency of NFC (~13.56 MHz), and doing the math to find the inductance needed. After confirming everything in LTSpice, [Phil] used a PCB coil calculator and let the KiCad coil generator draw it out.\nDid we mention the Jolly Wrencher is backlit by four side-mounted LEDs? Because whats an SAO without a few blinkenlights?\n \n\n", "title": "Jolly Wrencher\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fNFC\u30bf\u30b0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "SAO\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u306aSAO\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u30bf\u30c3\u30d7\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002M24LR04E IC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001PCB\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308bNFC\u30bf\u30b0\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001Jolly Wrencher\u306f4\u3064\u306eLED\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u304c\u7167\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Jolly Wrencher\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fNFC\u30bf\u30b0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "KiCad\u3067\u306e\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "NFC\u30bf\u30b0\u3067\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308bSAO\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "I\u00b2C\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5", "4\u3064\u306eLED\u3067\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u308bJolly Wrencher\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fSAO\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9"]}

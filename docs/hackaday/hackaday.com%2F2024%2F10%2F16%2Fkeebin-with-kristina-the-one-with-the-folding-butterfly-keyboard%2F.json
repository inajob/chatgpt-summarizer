Of course you do. If youre one of us, the answer is obvious: make it some kind of a PCB.\nImage by [Ricardo Daniel de Paula] via Hackaday.IOBut as those become commonplace, its imperative that you make it do something. Well, you could do a lot worse than giving someone a fully-functioning capacitive-touch keyboard to carry around.\n[Ricardo Daniel de Paula] initially chose the CH32V303 microcontroller because it has native USB 2.0 and 16 capacitive touch channels, which can support up to 48 keys via multiplexing.\nBut in order to reduce costs, [Ricardo] switched to the CH582M, which does all that plus Bluetooth communication. The goal is to have an affordable design for a unique, functioning business card, and I would say that this project has it in spades.\n\nBtrfld is a Folding Butterfly Keyboard\nThis origami beautys name is pronounced butter-fold, by the way. And thats because this is a folding, portable version of the original butterfly keyboard by [SolidusHal]. Be sure to check out the .gif of it folding and unfolding on the first link.\nImage by [SolidusHal] via redditInstead of the Kailh Chocs you were probably expecting, this bad boy has Cherry MX ULP (ultra-low profile) switches, which [SolidusHal] reports are really nice-feeling with a tactile bump. The jury is still out as to how they compare with Chocs, however. With these, the overall thickness of the thing is only 15.5 mm.\nAs [SolidusHal] says over on GitHub, there arent any amazing sources of ULP keycaps yet, so the best option is to print them, and of course youll find the STLs in the repo. But beware, an FDM printer isnt up to this task.\nWhile you could hand-wire this thing, board files are available, so you should probably use them if youre gonna build your own. And controller-wise, you can use a nice!nano or a BlueMicro840, or just a Pro Micro if you dont want Bluetooth.\nThe Centerfold: Taste the Rainbow\nImage by [haunterloo92] via redditYou know I cant resist a rainbow, right? And a translucent case too; that just takes the cake. This here is [haunterloo92]s Locus keyboard, which features a carbon fiber plate, Lichicx silent tactile switches, and GMK CYL ZX keycaps, which of course recall the Sinclair Spectrum ZX. Not sure what desk mat that is, but it recalls ye old Apple rainbow, dont you think? But good luck searching for it. (I had none.)\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: Salter No. 5\nThe curved keyboard of this Victorian beauty isnt just for looks  it was designed to mimic the shape of the hands and thus be more comfortable.\nThe Salter no. 5 in all its Victorian glory. Image via Antikey Chop\nWhat you cant do with this one is slouch in your chair, otherwise you wont see what youre typing over that curved, black shield in the middle.\nIt is thought that there were no Salter nos. 1-4, and that Salter started with a higher number as to appear more established. Although sold by George Salters family company, the typewriter was invented by James Samuel Foley in 1892.\nThe Salter no. 5 features a three-row keyboard with two Shifts, one for upper case and the other for figures. Altogether, there are 28 keys that can produce 84 characters.\nWhile early 5s used an ink pad, the later models employed a ribbon. They were marketed to compete with Remington typewriters and such, but at one-half or one-third the cost. Even so, they were one of the best typewriters available at the time.\nICYMI: KanaChord Plus Makes Comprehensive Japanese Input Simple\nHave you ever wished you had a separate, smaller keyboard for inputting another language so you didnt have to switch up your OS every time? Well, then KanaChord Plus is the keyboard for you, as long as your second language is Japanese.\nImage by [Mac Cody] via GitHub[Mac Cody]s update supports a whopping 6,165 Kanji along with 6,240 of the most common Japanese words containing Kanji. This is on top of what KanaChord already supported  all the Kana characters which make up the rest of Japanese writing.\nAs you may have guessed, KanaChord takes chording input  pressing multiple keys at once as you would on a piano. It uses color in order to indicate character type, Kana mode, and even to provide error feedback. Worried that it wont work with your OS? Theres a slide switch to select one of three Unicode key sequences. Guess which three.\nThe touch screen is the icing on this updated cake. As you chord, an incremental Input Method Editor will search the embedded dictionaries and display an ordered list of Japanese words and Kanji choices to scroll through and select. [Mac Cody] has plans to support the Pico 2 and will update the comprehensive repo when its ready.\n\nGot a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards?

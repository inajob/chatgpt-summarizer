But in decades past, such exotica were not on the menu for casual construction. Instead there were a range of LED seven segment displays which have now largely passed out of use.\nAmong them were HPs bubble displays, assemblies of miniature LEDs on a PCB, topped with plastic bubble lenses. If you had a calculator in the 1970s it probably had one, but in the present, [Joshua Coleman] has incorporated one into a pleasingly retro digital clock.\nInside the 3D printed case is an ESP32 with a pair of 74HC595 shift registers to drive the display, and an 18650 battery with all associated charging and protection circuitry. Its a surprisingly simple circuit, and the code is provided on the page. He makes an apology to non-Americans for his use of US date formats, but we think few readers will be unable to change it to reflect the only date format which really matters.\nIf you find a bubble display, hang on to it. Theyre certainly something weve seen before here a few times.", "title": "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "2025\u5e74\u3001\u624b\u9803\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u8c4a\u5bcc\u30021970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "ESP32\u306874HC595\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u8a08", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u8607\u308b70\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u6642\u8a08", "LED\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068DIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u518d\u5229\u7528\u8853"]}

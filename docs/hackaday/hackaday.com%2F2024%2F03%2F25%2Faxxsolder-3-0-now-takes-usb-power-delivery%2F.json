Now, its been updated with a whole host of nifty new features. Its AxxSolder 3.0!\nIf youre not intimately familiar with AxxSolder, its an open-source iron design based around the popular JBC soldering iron tips. Relying on the STM32G431CBT6 to run the show, it comes in two versions\u2014a lightweight portable design, and a desktop version based around the JBC ADS soldering iron stand. So far, so familiar.\nThe new 3.0 version adds new functionality, however. Where the previous model ran off any old DC power source from 9 to 26 volts, the new version can run off a USB Power Delivery supply. Thus, you can grab any old USB-PD device, like a laptop charger, and run your iron off that.\nThe new version also uses a larger color TFT screen with some buttons added on as an improved user interface. Thermal performance is improved, and its additionally capable of measuring the current draw by the tip, so you can monitor the performance of the iron in great detail.\nWeve featured the AxxSolder project previously, too, along with some other great soldering iron projects. If you reckon youve just designed the hottest new soldering tool yourself, let us know about it!"}

However, as [IndoorGeek] demonstrates, you can put them to wonderful use in a classical analog watch, too. They can make the perfect watch dial!\nHeres the thing. A printed circuit board is fundamentally some fiberglass coated in soldermask, some copper, maybe a layer of gold plating, and with some silk screen on top of that. As weve seen a million times, its possible to do all kinds of artistic things with PCBs; a watch dial seems almost obvious in retrospect!\n[IndoorGeek] steps through using Altium Designer and AutoCAD to layout the watch face. The guide also covers the assembly of the watch face into an actual wrist watch, including the delicate placement of the movement and hands. They note that there are also opportunities to go further\u2014such as introducing LEDs into the watch face given that it is a PCB, after all!\nIts a creative way to make a hardy and accurate watch face, and were surprised we havent seen more of this sort of thing before. Thats not to say we havent seen other kinds of watch hacks, though; for those, there have been many.

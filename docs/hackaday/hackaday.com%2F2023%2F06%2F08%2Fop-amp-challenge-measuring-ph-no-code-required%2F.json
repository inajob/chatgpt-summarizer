And while thats often the easiest way to get a project from idea to completion, its rarely the most interesting way.\nThis digital pH meter is a great example of that no-code design philosophy. According to [chris], the main use for this meter will be to measure soil pH in his garden, and the reason for eschewing a microcontroller was more or less for the challenge. And quite a challenge it was. Understanding the concept of pH isnt always easy, and many a budding chemist has fallen victim to its perils. Actually measuring pH isnt much easier, with the need to account for a lot of variables while measuring small voltages. Adding to the challenge was the fact that pretty much every skill on display here  from using KiCad to SMD soldering  was the first time [chris] had tackled them.\nTo amplify the voltage from the off-the-shelf pH probe, [chris] chose an LMV358A, a high-impedance FET-input version of the venerable LM358 op-amp, so as not to load down the probe. A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistor in the feedback path provides temperature compensation. He also designed a split power supply to provide positive and negative rails from a single 9-volt battery. The 3.5-digit LCD display is driven by an ICL7106 integrated A/D converter and BCD driver chip. Everything went into a nice-looking plastic enclosure thats very suitable for a portable instrument.\nAs of this writing, the Op-Amp Challenge has officially wrapped, and theres a slew of last-minute entries we need to go through. Check out the competition and stay tuned to find out who the judges pick for op-amp design glory!\n \n\n"}

However, you dont\u00a0need to do things this way. If youre more old school, you can program your AVRs right from a Commodore 64. [Linus Akesson] shows us how.\nProgramming an AVR isnt that hard. By holding the chip in reset, its possible to flash code via a serial protocol using just three wires. However, thats pretty impractical to do with modern PCs  they dont come with addressable IO pins anymore. Normally, youd use a dedicated programmer to do the job, but [Linus] found his had died on a Friday night. So he set about turning his C64 into one instead.\nHe decided to use the pins of the C64s Joystick Port 2, with pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 hooked up to SCK, MOSI, Reset, and MISO on the AVR, respectively. 5 V and Ground were also provided courtesy of the C64s port. He then whipped up a simple bit of assembly code to read a bit of AVR hex and spit it out over the Joystick port following the in-circuit programming protocol. With a 1541 Ultimate to load files on to the C64 in hand, it was easy to pull his compiled AVR program off his modern PC, chuck it on the C64, and then get the old Commodore to program the AVR in turn.\nIts not the first time [Linus] has wowed us with a C64 in hand.

And weve got a fine selection for your listening pleasure!\nThe 2025 Component Abuse Challenge has come to an end, so this week youll be hearing about a few of the entries. Weve received an impressive number, and as always were bowled over by the ingenuity of Hackaday readers in pushing parts beyond their limits.\nIn the news is the potential discovery of a lost UNIX version in a dusty store room at the University of Utah, Version 4 of the OS, which appeared in 1973. Check out your own stores, for hidden nuggets of gold. In the hacks, we have two cameras at the opposite end of the resolution spectrum, but sharing some impressive reverse engineering. Mouse cameras and scanner cameras were both a thing a couple of decades ago, and its great to see people still pushing the boundaries. Then we look at the challenge of encoding Chinese text as Morse code, an online-upgraded multimeter, the art of making lenses for an LED lighting effect, and what must be the best recreation of a Star Wars light sabre we have ever seen. In quick hacks we have a bevvy of Component Abuse Challenge projects, a Minecraft server on a smart light bulb, and a long term test of smartphone battery charging techniques.\nWe round off with a couple of our long-form pieces, first the uncertainties about iRobots future and what it might mean for their ecosystem  think: cheap hackable robotics platform!  and then a look at FreeBSD as an alternative upgrade path for Windows users. Its a path not without challenges, but the venerable OS still has plenty to give.\nAs always, you can listen using the links below, and weve laidout links to all the articles under discussion at the bottom of the page.\n\nDownload our finest MP3 right here.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 345 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nComponent Abuse Challenge\nHave They Found A Complete UNIX V4?\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThink you know what the sound is?\u00a0 Put your metaphorical two cents in here.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nCamera Capabilities Unlocked From A Mouse\n\nOptical Mouse Based Scanner\nDIY Optical Sensor Breakout Board Makes DIY Optical Mouse\n\n\nMedium Format, 3 GigaPixel Camera Puts It All On The Line (Sensor)\nMorse Code For China\n\nUTF-8 Is Beautiful\nUTF-8 \u2013 \u201cThe Most Elegant Hack\u201d\nReproduced And Recovered: The First Chinese Keyboard-based MingKwai Typewriter\n\n\nScreen-Accurate Lightsaber As A Practical Effect\nCheap Multimeter Gets Webified\nAn LED Projector As A Lighting Effect\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nRP2040 From Scratch: Roll Your Own Dev Board Magic\nRunning A Minecraft Server On A WiFi Light Bulb\nNest Thermostat: Now 100% Less Evil\nTesting Whether Fast Charging Kills Smartphone Batteries, And Other Myths\n\n\nJennys Picks:\n\n2025 Component Abuse Challenge: Dawg Gone LED Tester\n2025 Component Abuse Challenge: Glowing Neon From A 9 V Relay\n2025 Component Abuse Challenge: The Slip Ring In Your Parts Bin\nHave A Slice Of Bumble Berry Pi\n\n\n\nCant Miss Articles:\n\nIf IRobot Falls, Hackers Are Ready To Wrangle Roombas\nMoving From Windows To FreeBSD As The Linux Chaos Alternative\n"}

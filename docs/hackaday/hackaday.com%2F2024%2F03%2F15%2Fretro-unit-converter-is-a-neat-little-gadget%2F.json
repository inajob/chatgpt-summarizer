If youre sitting at a computer, you can usually just tap away in your browser to get a quick conversion done, or you can ask your smartphone for an answer. [HackMakeMod] wanted a bespoke device for this, though, and built a tiny little retro-styled unit converter.\n\nIts a straightforward build that uses a handful of familiar components. An ESP8266 D1 Mini development board is the heart of the operation, running off a small battery harvested from a disposable vape pen. It runs a 0.96 inch OLED display which has a menu system for selecting from a whole bunch of different unit conversions. Navigating the menu is done via a rotary encoder with an integrated push button. Everythings wrapped up in a neat 3D printed enclosure that was given a nice worn, weathered finish after printing.\n[HackMadeMod] also clearly thought about usability, too. Turning the encoder dial faster ramps up the numbers exponentially so youre not stuck jogging for ages when you need to enter a bigger figure.\nIts not something a lot of us would have a use case for, given that smartphones are always there and probably faster to use. However, it is a tidy little gadget, and a well-presented one at that. Video after the break.\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip!", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6301\u3064[HackMakeMod]\u304c\u3001ESP8266 D1 Mini\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u5358\u4f4d\u3092\u9078\u629e\u3057\u3001\u56de\u8ee2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3088\u308a\u901f\u3044\u304b\u306f\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01", "ESP8266 D1 Mini\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3055\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3088\u3046", "\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u7528\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b"]}

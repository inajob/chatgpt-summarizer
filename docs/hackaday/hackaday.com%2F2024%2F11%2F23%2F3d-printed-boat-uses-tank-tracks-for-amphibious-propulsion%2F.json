Occasionally, they use paddles. [Engineering After Hours] claims he is changing the boat game forever with his new 3D printed boat design that uses a tank tread for propulsion instead. Forgive him for the hyperbole of the YouTuber. Its basically a modified paddle design, but its also pretty cool.\nIt works on land, even if it doesnt steer well!\nThe basic idea is simple enough\u2014think floating snowmobile and youre in the ballpark. In the water, the chunky tank track provides forward propulsion with its paddle-like treads. Its not that much different from a paddle wheel steamer. However, where it diverges is that its more flexible than a traditional paddle wheel.\nThe tracked design is actually pretty good at propelling the boat in shallow water without getting stuck. In fact, it works pretty well on dirt, too! The video covers the basic concept, but it also goes into some detail regarding optimizing the design, too. Getting the float and track geometry right is key to performance, after all.\nIf youre looking to build an oddball amphibious craft, maybe working with the snowmobile concept is worth your engineering time.\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u8239\u306f\u3001\u5c65\u5e2f\u3067\u63a8\u9032\u3059\u308b\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u6d45\u702c\u3084\u571f\u3067\u3082\u52d5\u304f\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u63a8\u9032\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u6d45\u702c\u3067\u3082\u6d3b\u8e8d\u3059\u308b\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u69cb\u9020", "- \u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30d3\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3057\u305f\u6c34\u9678\u4e21\u7528\u8247", "- \u610f\u5916\u306a\u5834\u6240\u3067\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\uff01\u30bf\u30f3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

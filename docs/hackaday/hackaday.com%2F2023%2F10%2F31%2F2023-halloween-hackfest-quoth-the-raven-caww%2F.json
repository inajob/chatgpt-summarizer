This one began when [Istvan Raduly] scored a fake raven at a neighbors garage sale and decided to turn it into a thunder-and-lightning decoration that would frighten even the bravest trick-or-treater.\nGet close enough to this raven and youll set off the PIR sensor, which triggers lighting and sound effects, including some spooky glowing and blinking red eyes, general cawing, and of course, thunder. The light comes from a whopping 10-watt, 12-volt power LED. This birds brain is an Arduino Nano, which is protected from the 12V supply with a boost converter. As you might expect, the sounds are on an SD card and played through a DF Player Mini.\nSpookiness aside, our favorite part might be the absolutely lovely job that [Istvan] did decorating the ravens base. Hiding electronics and hot glue is one thing, but this is above and beyond. Be sure to check it out after the break, both in the safety of the house, and outside in the scary darkness.\n\n\n\n \n\n"}

Among them has been ReactOS, an open source clone of a millennium-era Windows OS, which we tried back in November. Its one of those slow-burn projects we know has been around for a long time, but still its a surprise to find weve reached the 30th anniversary of the first ReactOS code commit.\nThe post is a run through the projects history, and having followed it for a long time we recognize some of the milestones from the various ISOs we downloaded and tried back in the day. At the end it looks into the future with plans to support more up-to-date hardware as well as UEFI, which we hope will keep it relevant.\nWhen we tried it, we found an OS which could indeed be a Daily Driver on which a Hackaday article could be written  even if it wasnt the slickest experience on the block. It doesnt matter that its taken a while, if youre used to Windows XP this has become a usable replacement. We came to the conclusion that like FreeDOS it could find a niche in places where people need a modern version of the old OS to run older software, but perhaps as it now moves towards its mature phase it will move beyond that. We salute the ReactOS developers for bringing it this far, and for not giving up.\nYou can read our\u00a0Daily Drivers review of a recent ReactOS build here.", "title": "- ReactOS\u306e30\u5468\u5e74\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9OS\u306e\u9577\u3044\u6b74\u53f2", "body": "ReactOS\u306e30\u5468\u5e74\u3092\u8a18\u5ff5\u3057\u3001\u6b74\u53f2\u3084\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u65e7OS\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- ReactOS\u306e30\u5468\u5e74\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9OS\u306e\u9577\u3044\u6b74\u53f2", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\uff1aReactOS\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- ReactOS\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u8a08\u753b", "- \u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u306b\u8010\u3048\u308bReactOS\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u958b\u767a\u8005\u305f\u3061\u306b\u656c\u610f\u3092\u8868\u3057\u3066\uff1aReactOS\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1"]}

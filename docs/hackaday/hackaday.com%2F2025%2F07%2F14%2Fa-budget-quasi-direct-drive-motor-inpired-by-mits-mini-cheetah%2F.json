[Caden Kraft] encountered this disparity when he was building a SCARA arm and needed good actuators. An actuator like those on MITs Mini Cheetah would have been ideal, but they cost about $300. Instead, [Caden] designed his own actuator, much cheaper but still with excellent performance.\nThe actuator [Caden] built is a quasi-direct-drive actuator, which combines a brushless DC motor with an integrated gearbox in a small, efficient package. [Caden] wanted all of the custom parts in the motor to be 3D printed, so a backing iron for the permanent magnets was out of the question. Instead, he arranged the magnets to form a Halbach array; according to his simulations, this gave almost identical performance to a motor with a backing iron. As a side benefit, this reduced the inertia of the rotor and let it reverse more easily.\nTo increase torque, [Caden] used a planetary gearbox with cycloidal gear profiles, which may be the stars of the show here. These reduced backlash, decreased stress concentration on the teeth, and were easier to 3D print. He found a Python program to generate planetary gearbox designs, but ended up creating a fork with the ability to export 3D files. The motor\u2019s stator was commercially-bought and hand-wound, and the finished drive integrates a cheap embedded motor controller.\nTo test the actuator, [Caden] attached an arm and applied perpendicular force. The actuator only failed on the first test because it was drawing more current than his power supply could provide, so he tested again with an EV battery module. This time, it provided 29.4 Nm of torque, almost three times his initial goal, without suffering any damage. [Caden] only stopped the test because it was drawing 50 A, and he thought he was getting close to the hardware\u2019s limit. Given that he was able to build the entire actuator for less than $80, we think he\u2019s well exceeded his goals.\nIf you\u2019re interested in the inspiration for this actuator, we\u2019ve covered the Mini Cheetah before. We\u2019ve also seen these drives used to build other quadrupedal robots.\nThanks to [Delilah] for the tip!", "title": "- MIT\u3068\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u300c\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "body": "MIT\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5b9a\u7fa9\u3068\u3001Caden\u306b\u3088\u308b\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002", "titles": ["- MIT\u3068\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u300c\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u30a2\u30af\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u30cf\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30cf\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u60d1\u661f\u30ae\u30a2\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- $80\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u30a2\u30af\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4e8b\u4f8b"]}

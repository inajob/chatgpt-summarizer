Luckily, though, we can all follow along with the proceedings thanks to the livestreams on the Hackaday channel, which of course will all be available once theyre edited in case you miss anything live. There are a ton of interesting talks coming up, so therell be a lot to catch up on when the dust settles. And that wont be far from now; by the time this post publishes, Supercon will be all but over, which makes it the Thanksgiving dinner of cons  all that work and its over in just a few minutes.\n\nAnd once you come down from your post-Supercon high, itll be time to start thinking about what comes next. May we be so bold as to suggest coming up with a talk or workshop proposal for the 2024 Open Hardware Summit? The summit is tentatively scheduled for the end of April, or it may go into early May. Either way, itll be in Montreal, a beautiful city that can be pretty nice in the early Spring. The deadline for proposals is December 17, so start thinking about what you can bring to the table and get your proposals together.\nIn space news  because it wouldnt be a Links article without space news  it looks like Solar Cycle 25 has some surprises in store for us. Back when this solar cycle started, expectations were that there would be relatively little activity at solar maximum, as assessed by the number of observed sunspots, which correlates to the magnetic activity beneath the Suns surface. Cycle 25 has already blown that prediction, with far more sunspots than expected  solar maximum for this cycle was supposed to have a sunspot number of about 115; were currently sitting around 130 or so. Not only that, solar maximum is probably going to arrive well ahead of schedule, possibly as early as the beginning of 2024. Thats a huge difference from the prediction of July 2025 for peak activity. That also means the solar max peak could stretch out far longer, which could have interesting implications for radio propagation, increased risk of Earth-impacting coronal mass ejections, and disruptions to satellites in orbit. On the plus side, solar maximum during the upcoming total solar eclipse could make for some pretty wild views of the corona.\nIf youve read the Links column much, itll be no surprise that we love factory tours around here. And brief though it may be, MagPi magazines tour of the Raspberry Pi 5 factory is worth checking out. The Pi 5 isnt the only thing made at the Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, of course; they make a ton of Sony broadcast cameras and associated equipment there too. As you can imagine, theres a lot of tech on the assembly line, but a lot of it is cobot work cells, where robots and humans work on the same steps. Theyre geared up to make 250,000 Pi 5s a week, which will hopefully put a dent in inventories and drive the pandemic-inflated prices weve all gotten used to back to more reasonable levels.\n\nAnd finally, while were not sure wed quite follow suit, Kyle Hill has a new video where he gets up close and personal with high-level radioactive waste, for reasons? Actually, what Kyle has in mind here is the de-Simpsonization of the nuclear power industry. Kyle is a big booster of nuclear energy, so after touring places where nuclear power went terribly wrong, like Chernobyl and Fukushima, he wangled a tour of the Dresden Generating Station in Illinois, the first privately financed nuclear power station in the US. His goal is to dispel the myths surrounding radioactive waste storage, to which end he toured the fuel rod cooling pools with their eerie blue Cherenkov glow, or sonic booms of light in water, as he aptly puts it. The big moment comes out at the dry flask yard, where immense concrete and steel cylinders hold fuel rods for enough half-lives to render them harmless; thats where Kyle shows his true feelings about nuclear power. Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, after all.\n"}

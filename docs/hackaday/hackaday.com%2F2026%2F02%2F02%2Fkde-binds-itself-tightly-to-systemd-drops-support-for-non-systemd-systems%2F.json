This has especially the FreeBSD community upset, but will also affect Linux distros that do not use systemd. The focus of the KDE team is clear, as stated in the referenced Reddit thread, where a KDE developer replies that the goal is to rely on systemd for more tasks in the future. This means that PLM is just the first step.\nIn the eyes of KDE it seems that OSes that do not use systemd are niche and not worth supporting, with said niche Linux distros that would be cut out including everything from Gentoo to Alpine Linux and Slackware. Regardless of your stance on systemds merits or lack thereof, it would seem to be quite drastic for one of the major desktop environments across Linux and BSD to suddenly make this decision.\nIt also raises the question of in how far this is related to the push towards a distroless and similarly more integrated, singular version of Linux as an operating system. Although there are still many other DEs that will happily run for the foreseeable future on your flavor of GNU/Linux or BSD  regardless of whether youre more about about a System V or OpenRC init-style environment  this might be one of the most controversial divides since systemd was first introduced.\nTop image: KDE Plasma 6.4.5.

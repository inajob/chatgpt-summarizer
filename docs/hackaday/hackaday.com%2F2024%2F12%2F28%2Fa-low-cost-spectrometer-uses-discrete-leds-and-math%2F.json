The standard design is simple; a prism or diffraction grating to break up a light source into a spectrum and a detector to measure light intensity. Shine the light through your sample, scan through the spectrum, and graph the results. Pretty easy.\nThats not the only way to do it, though, as [Markus Bindhammer] shows with this proof-of-concept UV/visible spectrometer. Rather than a single light source, [Marb] uses six discrete LEDs, each with a different wavelength. The almost-a-rainbows-worth of LEDs are mounted on circular PCB, which is mounted to a stepper motor through a gear train. This allows the instrument to scan through all six colors, shining each on the sample one at a time. On the other side of the flow-through sample cuvette is an AS7341 10-channel color sensor, which can measure almost the entire spectrum from UV to IR.\nThe one place where this design seems iffy is that the light source spectrum isnt continuous, as it would be in a more traditional design. But [Marb] has an answer for that; after gathering data at each wavelength, he applies a cubic spline interpolation to derive the spectrum. Its demonstrated in the video below using chlorophyll extracted from spinach leaves, and it seems to generate a reasonable spectrum. We suppose this might miss a narrow absorbance spike, but perhaps this could be mitigated by adding a few more LEDs to the color wheel.\n\n\n", "title": "UV/\u53ef\u8996\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306eDIY\uff1aLED\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "body": "\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001LED\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5206\u5149\u5668\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["UV/\u53ef\u8996\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306eDIY\uff1aLED\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30686\u8272LED\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u8272\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u5e83\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5206\u5149\u8a08\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u88dc\u9593\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u975e\u9023\u7d9a\u5149\u6e90\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u89e3\u6790", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u5206\u5149\u8a08\uff1a\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u8349\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u7d50\u679c"]}

Among his favorites is the Seamaster Calypso III, a precious few of which were created in a lovely and rare black-on-black colorway. [STR-Alorman] found one on online, but it had a number of problems including a scratched-up face. Having done a respectable amount of PCB design and assembly, he decided to make a new face and have it fabbed.\nThe one angle where you can even tell this is a PCB.\nAfter taking scale-referenced photos with a DSLR, [STR-Alorman] created vectors in Illustrator and then ported those to KiCad. He sent two versions to the board house  one with holes at index points, and one without  because he wasnt sure which would be better for applying the luminization compound that makes them glow. Spoiler alert: it was the one with the cutouts.\nOnce this was done, [STR-Alorman] reassembled the movement, which doesnt look easy at all, and involved getting the height of a bit of CA glue just right so as not to interfere with the movement of the date wheel. He replaced the bezel insert, re-luminized the hands, and now has a beautiful timepiece.\nWe believe only the nerdiest of nerds could tell this is a PCB, and they would need exactly the right light to make that determination. Heres a watch that leaves no doubt about it."}

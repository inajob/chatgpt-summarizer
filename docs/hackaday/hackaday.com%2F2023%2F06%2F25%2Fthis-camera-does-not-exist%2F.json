You can tell, somehow. So just how do you make a perfectly rendered scene look a little more realistic? If youre [sirrandalot], you take a photograph. But not by taking a picture of your monitor with a camera. Instead, hes simulating a colour film camera in extraordinary levels of detail within Blender itself.\nThe point of a rendering package is that it simulates light, so it shouldnt be such a far-fetched idea that it could simulate the behaviour of light in a camera. Starting with a simple pinhole camera he moves on to a meniscus lens, and then creates a compound lens to correct for its imperfections. The development of the camera mirrors that of the progress of real cameras over the 20th century, simulating the film with its three colour-sensitive layers and even the antihalation layer, right down to their differing placements in the focal plane. Its an absurd level of detail but it serves as both a quick run-down of how a film camera and its film work, and how Blender simulates the behaviour of light.\nFinally we see the camera itself, modeled to look like a chunky medium format Instamatic, and some of its virtual photos. We cant say all of them remove the feel of a rendered image, but they certainly do an extremely effective job of simulating a film photograph. We love this video, take a look at it below the break.\n\n\nThanks [Concreted0g] for the tip."}

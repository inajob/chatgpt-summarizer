This was the part that gave so many engineers and programmers their first introduction to a computer of their own. Even though now outdated its presence has been a constant over the decades. Zilog will continue to sell a Z80 derivative in the form of their eZ80, but thats not the only place the core can be found on silicon. [Rejunity] is bringing us an open-source z80 core on real hardware, thanks of course to the TinyTapeout ASIC project. The classic core will occupy two tiles on the upcoming TinyTapeout 7. While perhaps its not quite the same as a real 40-pin DIP in your hands, like all of the open-source custom silicon world, its as yet early days.\nThe core in question is derived from the TV80 open-source core, which we would be very interested to compare when fabricated at TinyTapeouts 130nm process with an original chip from a much larger 1970s process. While Its true that this project is more of an interesting demonstration of TinyTapeout than a practical everyday Z80, it does at least serve as a reminder that there may be a future point in which a run of open-source real Z80s or other chips might become possible.\nThis isnt the first time weve featured a TinyTapeout project."}

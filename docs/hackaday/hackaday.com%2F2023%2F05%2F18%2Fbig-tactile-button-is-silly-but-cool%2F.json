[ROBO HUB] has built a giant version as a tribute, and it works just like the real thing!\nThe giant button has been scaled up 20 times compared to the original. For simplicitys sake, [ROBO HUB] designed this replica to use materials readily available around the home. Thanks to its cardboard construction, its easy to replicate with a minimum of tools. One need merely cut out the various sections before assembling them together with hot glue, with popsicle sticks serving as the legs. A juice bottle is used as the primary button itself, with aluminium foil serving as the contacts and rubber bands standing in for the spring.\nIts not the most useful button, given that it its quite fragile and has a weak spring return. However, it would be a great teaching tool to show students exactly whats going on inside an actual button. As a bonus, it looks like it would be remarkably fun to pound on to activate some kind of massive air horn. Just an idea.\n\n"}

These structures are similar in spirit to the Hoberman sphere, which is a compact structure that can be expanded to fill a large space.\n\nThe double-rack units get a lot more interesting when you combine two or more of them. They each have rails that accommodate additional double-racks, holding the double-racks together. Because of how the gears from each double-rack are connected to the teeth of the others, expanding two double-racks causes all connected units to also expand.\nThrough the rest of the video, [Henry] shows you the marvelous myriad ways the basic structures can be combined to make remarkable expanding racks. He also explains some of the missteps and gotchas that his latest designs avoid based on his experience.\nIf youre interested in such things, you might also like to check out Lathe Gears Make A Clock or Gear Up: A 15-Minute Intro On Involute Gears.\nDo you have your own mechanical engineering hacks?

Rather than solder the LEDs straight, the frame has 280 teeth that support each one at a 55\u00b0 angle.\nNot only does this look cool, it makes the bridging of DOUT to DIN much easier. That leaves GND and VCC to be painstakingly connected with 30 AWG wire. How, you might ask? With a little help from 3.5x magnifying glasses and the smallest soldering iron tip available, of course.\nBut thats not all. Since 280 addressable LEDs need a lot of power, [makeTVee] also designed a holder for the LiPo battery pack that fits into the existing AA holders.\nWant to see more awesome badge hacks?

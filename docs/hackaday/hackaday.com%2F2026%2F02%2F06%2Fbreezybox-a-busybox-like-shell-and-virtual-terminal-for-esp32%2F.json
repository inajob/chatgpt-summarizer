A demo implementation is also provided, which uses the ESP32-S3 platform as part of the Waveshare 7 display development board.\nAlthough it invokes the BusyBox name, its not meant to be as stand-alone as it uses the standard features provided by the FreeRTOS-based ESP-IDF SDK. In addition to the features provided by ESP-IDF it adds things like a basic virtual terminal, current working directory (CWD) tracking and a gaggle of Unix-style commands, as well as an app installer.\nThe existing ELF binary loader for the ESP32 is used to run executables either from a local path or a remote one, a local HTTP server is provided and you even get ANSI color support. Some BreezyBox apps can be found here, with them often running on a POSIX-compatible system as well. This includes the xcc700 self-hosted C compiler.\nYou can get the MIT-licensed code either from the above GitHub project link or install it from the Espressif Component Registry if thats more you thing.\n\n", "title": "- ESP32\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cBreezyBox\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "BreezyBox\u306fESP32\u5411\u3051\u306bUnix\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u3001\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u62e1\u5f35\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- ESP32\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u300cBreezyBox\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- BusyBox\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305fESP32\u306e\u958b\u767a\u74b0\u5883", "- BreezyBox\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- FreeRTOS\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eESP-IDF SDK\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fBreezyBox", "- ESP32\u7528\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308bBreezyBox\u306e\u7279\u5fb4"]}

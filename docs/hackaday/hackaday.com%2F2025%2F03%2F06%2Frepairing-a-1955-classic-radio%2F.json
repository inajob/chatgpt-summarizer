After all, the thing you are fixing, presumably, worked at one time or another. These days, thats not always true as fixing modern gear can be quite a challenge. Watching [Kens] repair of an old 1955 Silvertone radio reminded us of a simpler time. You can watch the action on the video below.\nIf youve never had the pleasure of working on an AM radio, you should definitely try it. Some people would use an amplifier to find where the signal dies out. Others will inject a signal into the radio to find where it stops. A good strategy is to start at the volume control and decide if it is before or after that. Then split the apparently bad section roughly in half and test that portion\u2014sort of a hardware binary search. Of course, your first step should probably be to verify power, but after that, the hunt is on.\n\nTheres something very satisfying about taking a dead radio and then hearing it come to life on your bench. In this case, some of the problems were from a previous repair.\nTroubleshooting is an art all by itself. Restoring old radios is also great fun.\n"}

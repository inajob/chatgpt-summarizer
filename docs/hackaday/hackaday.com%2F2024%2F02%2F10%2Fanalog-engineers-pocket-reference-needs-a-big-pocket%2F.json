For example, consider LTSpice. Sure, it has the companys models baked in. But theres no reason you cant use it for anything. Thanks! We were interested to see Texas Instruments fifth edition of the Analog Engineers Pocket Reference is still freely available. While we arent sure a book with nearly 200 pages in it is a pocket reference, we do think youll enjoy it, even if you dont want to use TIs offerings. This book has been around for 50 years, but it is updated periodically, and this version is the fifth iteration.\nThe book has several sections ranging from conversion between units and color codes to amplifier noise calculations and understanding ADC settling times. Want to know more about PCB microstrips? Page 85.\n\nYou do have to create a TI account to download, but if that bothers you, you surely have a throwaway e-mail address somewhere. Some of the information is basic. You probably know how capacitors add in parallel, for example. But some of the data is a bit more obscure. For example, most people dont know the slope of the change in voltage drop over a diode according to voltage.\nBesides, it is nice to have everything in one place and in a PDF that you can tuck away anywhere. Outside of branding, there is little to remind you this book is from a vendor, although on page 4, they have a list of other free resources of general interest such as The Signal e-book and Circuit Cookbooks, although some of those may be more TI-specific.\nWe love freebie books from vendors that are generally applicable. For example, Analog has a great SDR book. You can also find a link to a great DSP book from them in that post. Of course, there are good books from the community, too."}

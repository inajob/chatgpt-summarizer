Because of aerodynamics and other pesky physical laws there are a few complications to this, of course, but this didnt deter\u00a0[Luke Bell] and his father [Mike Bell] from nailing the Guinness World Record for remote-controlled quadcopters on April 21, 2024. During the official run, a top speed of 480.23 km/h was recorded, making it considerably faster than the first version they made, which hit a measly 400 km/h.\nFor this second iteration of the got to go fast quadcopter, the design was scaled up, with more powerful motors and associated electronics added. Naturally, when youre pushing brushless motors and their ESCs to their limits, stuff can get a bit hot due to the immense currents flowing through the system. This resulted in a number of battery, wire and other fires. Fortunately, the worrying aspect of in-flight stability got addressed pretty well courtesy of a professional drone trainer, and ultimately the world record attempt went off without a hitch.\nAn endurance test was also attempted, which reached 7.5 km at 180 km/h, and with the clear canopy in from of the camera removed, visual performance was pretty stunning, while still easily reaching 400 km/h. This might make it the perfect high-speed chase camera system.\nThanks to [Craig] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "Guinness World Record\u3092\u9054\u6210\uff01\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u66f4\u65b0", "body": "\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u6a39\u7acb\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6480.23km/h\u3002\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u3001\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3002180km/h\u30677.5km\u3092\u98db\u884c\u3057\u3001\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u6027\u3082\u629c\u7fa4\u3002\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u304b\u3089\u3002", "titles": ["Guinness World Record\u3092\u9054\u6210\uff01\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u66f4\u65b0", "\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30a2\u30c9\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\uff1a\u5927\u578b\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0", "400 km/h\u306b\u5230\u9054\uff01\u901f\u3055\u3092\u8ffd\u7a76\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bb6\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u52a9\u8a00\u3067\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u6311\u6226\u304c\u6210\u529f", "\u6301\u7d9a\u6027\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff1a180 km/h\u30677.5 km\u3001\u9a5a\u7570\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u8ffd\u8de1\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u8a95\u751f"]}

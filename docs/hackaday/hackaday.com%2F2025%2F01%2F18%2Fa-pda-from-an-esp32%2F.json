Its thus shown up in quite a few handheld computers, whether they be conference badges or standalone devices, and this is definitely a field in which these chips have more to give. Were pleased then to see this e-ink PDA from [ashtf8], which we think raises the bar on this type of device.\nAt its heart is an ESP32-S3, on the back side of a QWERTY keyboard PCB, and for a display it has an e-ink screen. To get over the annoying e-ink refresh when typing text it uses a hybrid of e-ink and OLED, with a small OLED holding the current line which can be periodically sent to the e-ink. Perhaps the nicest thing about the hardware though is the clear resin printed clamshell case, and a hand-cast silicone membrane for the keyboard. That has always been a part considered difficult to produce, and here he is making one from scratch. Take a look at the video below the break.\nSoftware-wise it has a range of apps with more promised, but even as it stands it looks useful enough to work with. If thats not enough, then perhaps an ESP32 operating system would help.\n\n"}

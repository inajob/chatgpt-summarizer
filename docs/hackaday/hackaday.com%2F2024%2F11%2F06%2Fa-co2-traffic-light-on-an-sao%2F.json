[David] got a leg up on development by creating a simple SAO breakout board, which could have either the male and female connectors fitted, as required. Next, he successfully guessed that the badge would be based around the RP2040 running MicroPython and hooked up an Adafruit Feather RP2040 board to get started on some software to drive the thing. This made hooking up to the official badge an easy job. Since the SAO has only two GPIOs, [David] needed to decode these to drive the three LEDs. There are a few ways to avoid this, but he wanted to relive his earlier EE college years and do it the direct way using a pair of 74HC00 quad NAND gate chips.\nWeve seen a few CO2 monitors over the years. This sleek little unit is based around the Seeeduino XIAO module and uses an LED ring as an indicator. Proper CO2 monitors can be a little pricey, and there are fakes out there. Finally, CO2 is not the only household pollutant; check out this project.", "title": "\u300cCO2\u6fc3\u5ea6\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01Hackaday Supercon 2024\u7528SAO\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "body": "\u30c7\u30a4\u30d3\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u306fCO2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u306eSAO\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cCO2\u6fc3\u5ea6\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\uff01Hackaday Supercon 2024\u7528SAO\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300cSensirion SCD40\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fCO2\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u300d", "\u300cRP2040\u3068MicroPython\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059CO2\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u300d", "\u300c74HC00\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLED\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u300d", "\u300c\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eCO2\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\u300d"]}

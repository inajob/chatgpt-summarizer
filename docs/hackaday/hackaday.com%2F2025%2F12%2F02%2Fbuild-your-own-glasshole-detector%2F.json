This sentence might already start to sound dodgy, and it doesnt get better when you think about todays smart glasses, like the ones built by Meta (aka Facebook).\n[sh4d0wm45k] doesnt shy away from fighting fire with fire, and shows you how to build a wireless device detecting Metas smart glasses  or any other companys Bluetooth devices, really, as long as you can match them by the beginning of the Bluetooth MAC address.\n[sh4d0wm45k]s device is a mini light-up sign saying GLASSHOLE, that turns bright white as soon as a pair of Meta glasses is detected in the vicinity. Under the hood, a commonly found ESP32 devboard suffices for the task, coupled to two lines of white LEDs on a custom PCB. The code is super simple, sifting through packets flying through the air, and lets you easily contribute with your own OUIs (Organizationally Unique Identifier, first three bytes of a MAC address). It wouldnt be hard to add such a feature to any device of your own with Arduino code under its hood, or to rewrite it to fit a platform of your choice.\nWeve been talking about smart glasses ever since Google Glass, but recently, with Metas offerings, the smart glasses debate has reignited. Due to inherent anti-social aspects of the technology, we can see whatd motivate one to build such a hack. Perhaps, the next thing well see is some sort of spoofed packets shutting off the glasses, making them temporarily inoperable in your presence in a similar way weve seen with spamming proximity pairing packets onto iPhones."}

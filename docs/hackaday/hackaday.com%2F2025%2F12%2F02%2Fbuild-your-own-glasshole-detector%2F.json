This sentence might already start to sound dodgy, and it doesnt get better when you think about todays smart glasses, like the ones built by Meta (aka Facebook).\n[sh4d0wm45k] doesnt shy away from fighting fire with fire, and shows you how to build a wireless device detecting Metas smart glasses  or any other companys Bluetooth devices, really, as long as you can match them by the beginning of the Bluetooth MAC address.\n[sh4d0wm45k]s device is a mini light-up sign saying GLASSHOLE, that turns bright white as soon as a pair of Meta glasses is detected in the vicinity. Under the hood, a commonly found ESP32 devboard suffices for the task, coupled to two lines of white LEDs on a custom PCB. The code is super simple, sifting through packets flying through the air, and lets you easily contribute with your own OUIs (Organizationally Unique Identifier, first three bytes of a MAC address). It wouldnt be hard to add such a feature to any device of your own with Arduino code under its hood, or to rewrite it to fit a platform of your choice.\nWeve been talking about smart glasses ever since Google Glass, but recently, with Metas offerings, the smart glasses debate has reignited. Due to inherent anti-social aspects of the technology, we can see whatd motivate one to build such a hack. Perhaps, the next thing well see is some sort of spoofed packets shutting off the glasses, making them temporarily inoperable in your presence in a similar way weve seen with spamming proximity pairing packets onto iPhones.", "title": "\u30e1\u30bf\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "Meta\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001Bluetooth MAC\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u61f8\u5ff5\u304b\u3089\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u308b\u6280\u8853\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e1\u30bf\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "ESP32\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300cGLASSHOLE\u300d\u5149\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3", "Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u898b\u5206\u3051\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

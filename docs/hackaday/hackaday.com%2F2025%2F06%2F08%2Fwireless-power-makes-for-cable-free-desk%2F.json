[Matt] from DIYPerks has the best of both worlds with this wireless-powered, no-cable desk setup.\nThe secret is embedded within the plywood desk: an evaluation kit from Etherdyne Technologies, Inc consisting of a 100 W RF power supply and its associated power antenna looping around the desktop edge. The mechanism is similar to the inductive charging often seen on phones nowadays, but at higher frequency and larger scale, enabling power to be transmitted several feet (at least a meter) above the desktop.\nThe range is impressive (this isnt the maximum), but the efficiency is not advertised.\nThe kit from ETI contained several PCB-coil receivers, which [Matt] built into a number of devices, including a lamp, heated cup, microphone, speakers, his mouse, keyboard, and even a custom base to run his monitor, which really shows the power these things can pull.\nThe microphone is a non-Bluetooth RF unit lovingly modified to studio quality, at least as far as we can tell on laptop speakers through YouTubes compression. The speakers use a pair of Bluetooth modules to negotiate stereo sound while staying in sync. And before you ask what about signal for the monitor? we have to inform you that was taken care of too, via a wireless HDMI dongle. Check it out in the video below.\nOf course the elephant in the room here is power usage  theres a 10 W base draw, and probably a big hit to efficiency vs cabled-everything but we figure he gets partway to a pass on that by using a Frameworks mainboard instead desktop hardware. Indeed, a full analysis might show that the transmission efficiency of this system is no worse than the power to charge/discharge inefficiencies in a more conventional battery powered wireless setup.\nWhile no wires is pretty clean, were not sure this beats the totally-hidden-in-the-desk PC [Matt] built last year in terms of minimalist aesthetic.\u00a0 That Frameworks mainboard also likely lacks the power of his triple-screen luggable, but this was still an entertaining build.\n\n"}

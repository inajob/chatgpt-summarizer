Like many beginners, he found traditional robotics instructions overwhelming and hard to follow, bogged down with dense math that often obscured the bigger picture. So he decided to approach things differently and create something with his own hands. The result? A 3D-printed robotic arm he affectionately calls ManiPilator.\nThis article is the first in a three-part series documenting [Leo]\u2019s hands-on approach to learning robotics from the ground up. Building ManiPilator became an opportunity to learn by doing, and the project took him on a journey of experimenting, failing, and eventually succeeding in tasks that seemed deceptively simple at first glance. Each hurdle provided him with insights that more traditional learning methods hadn\u2019t delivered. Below is one of the videos [Leo] captured, to show one step in the process: doing a check using multiple motors.\nTo make his project work, [Leo] relied on open-source software like Klipper, piecing together code and hardware in a way that made sense to him. In sharing his story, he offers fellow beginners an approachable perspective on robotics, with practical insights and candid reflections on the challenges and breakthroughs.\n[Leo]s project shows that there\u2019s more than one way to start exploring robotics, and that sometimes the best way to learn is simply to dive in and start building. Follow along with his journey as he tackles the complexities of robotics, one step at a time.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cManiPilator\u300d\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bLeo Goldstien\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0ManiPilator\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u5b66\u7fd2\u6cd5\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u3001\u5b9f\u8df5\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5b66\u3073\u3092\u5f37\u8abf\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2Klipper\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cManiPilator\u300d\u306e\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30ec\u30aa\u304c\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u5165\u9580\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u30ec\u30aa\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u88fd\u4f5c\u7269\u8a9e", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\uff1a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5b66\u3073\u65b9"]}

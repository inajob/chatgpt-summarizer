It costs about $20, and is remarkably easy to hack. [Floyd Steinberg] took advantage of this to turn it into a rather unique MIDI controller.\nWhat makes the Colmi R02 somewhat unique is that the manufacturer did not try to lock out users from uploading their own firmware. You dont even really need to hack it, since there is no code signing or encryption. You can just whip up your own firmware to make it do whatever you want.\nTo that end, [Floyd] set up the ring to act as a device for musical expression. When connected to a computer over Bluetooth, data from the rings accelerometer is converted into MIDI CC commands via a simple web app. The app allows the MIDI messages to be configured so they can control whatever parameter is desired. [Floyd] demonstrates the ring by using it to control filter cutoff frequencies on an outboard synthesizer, with great effect.\nYou could theoretically just strap an accelerometer to your hand with a microcontroller and achieve similar operation. However, the magic of this is that it costs only $20 and its already in a form factor thats optimized for wearing on your finger. Its hard to beat that.\nFiles are on GitHub for those eager to experiment. Weve previously featured some hacks of this particular smart ring, too, with [Aaron Christophels] efforts directly inspiring this work.\n\n"}

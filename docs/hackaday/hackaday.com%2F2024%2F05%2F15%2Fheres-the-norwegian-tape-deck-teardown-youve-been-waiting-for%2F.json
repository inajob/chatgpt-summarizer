Whether your vice is CRTs, film cameras, or tape decks, youll know that the very best gear simply isnt manufactured anymore. Even the day-to-day stuff from 60 years ago is often a cut above a lot of todays equipment. [Anthony Kouttron] shows us this with his teardown of a Tandberg TCD301 from many decades ago.\nThe Tandberg unit is beautifully finished in wood and metal, a style of construction thats fairly rare these days. Its got big, chunky controls, and a certain level of heft that is out of vogue in modern electronics. Heavy used to mean good \u00a0these days, it means old. Thats not to say its indestructible, though. Its full of lots of old plastic pulleys and fasteners that have aged over the decades, so its a little fragile inside.\nStill, [Anthony] gives us a great look at the aluminium chassis and buttons and the electromechanical parts inside. Its a rats-nest design with lots of discrete components and wires flying between boards. You couldnt economically produce this and sell it to anyone today, but this is how it was done so many years ago.\nThis non-functional unit ended up being little more than a salvage job, but were still glad that [Anthony] gave us a look inside. Still, if you long for more cassette-themed teardowns, weve got the goodness youre looking for!"}

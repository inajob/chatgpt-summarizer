However, you can also cop a nasty surprise on the receiving end if youre not careful, as explained in a video from [Grants Pass TV Repair].\nIts hard to see in a still image, but the RF burns from the kite antenna actually generate a little puff of smoke on contact.\nAn experiment was used to demonstrate this fact involving a kite and a local AM broadcaster. A simple calculation revealed that an antenna 368 feet and 6 inches long would be resonant with the KAJO Radio signal at 1.270 MHz. At half the signals wavelength, an antenna that long would capture plenty of energy from the nearby broadcast antenna.\nEnter the kite, which served as a skyhook to loft an antenna that long. With the wire in the air picking up a strong signal from the AM radio tower, it was possible to get a noticable RF burn simply by touching the end of the antenna.\nThe video explains that this is a risky experiment, but not only because of the risk of RF burn itself. Its also easy to accidentally get a kite tangled in power lines, or to see it struck by lightning, both of which would create far greater injuries than the mild RF burn seen in the video. In any case, even if you know what youre doing, you have to be careful when youre going out of your way to do something dangerous in the first place.\nAM radio towers arent to be messed with; theyve got big power flowing. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304b\u3089\u306eRF\u706b\u50b7\uff1a\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "body": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u308b\u3068RF\u706b\u50b7\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3001\u71c3\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u69d8\u5b50\u3082\u3002\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3067AM\u653e\u9001\u3092\u53d7\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u8d77\u304d\u305f\u3002\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u306f\u5927\u304d\u306a\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u53d7\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5371\u967a\u3002\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067RF\u706b\u50b7\u3092\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u304b\u3089\u306eRF\u706b\u50b7\uff1a\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "\u30ab\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1aAM\u653e\u9001\u5854\u3068\u306e\u5171\u632f\u73fe\u8c61", "\u9ad8\u3044\u96fb\u6ce2\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\uff1aRF\u706b\u50b7\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027", "AM\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5854\u3068\u306e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u6545\uff1a\u5371\u967a\u306a\u96fb\u6ce2\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u767a\u751f\uff1a\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306b\u3088\u308bRF\u706b\u50b7"]}

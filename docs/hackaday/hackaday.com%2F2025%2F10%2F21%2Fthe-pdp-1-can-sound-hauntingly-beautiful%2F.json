Still, few chip musicians show up to a gig hauling a PDP-1. Thats perhaps a shame, given that the 1950s era machine can produce beautiful music\u2014as demonstrated by [Peter Samson] and [Joe Lynch].\nThe video demonstration was recorded at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. [Peter Samson] is operating the PDP-1, which is running the Harmony Compiler\u2014which allows the machine to play four individual voices. This is achieved by taking advantage of the PDP-1s program flags, which are visible as six light bulbs on the control panel. Instructions can be used to turn these bulbs on and off. The Harmony Compiler works by switching the bulbs on and off fast enough to create audible square waves when the light bulb outputs are wired to a simple audio amplifier.\nUsing Harmony Compiler, [Joe] and [Peter] worked together to transcribe the song Olson\u00a0by Boards of Canada to play on the PDP-1. The song is encoded on paper tape, and fed into the machine\u2014which dutifully plays back the hauntingly beautiful melody.\nIf youre interested in the code that achieved this, its blessedly available via Github. If you love stories about old computers playing music, weve got those too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]\n"}

Read all about the 2025 Component Abuse Challenge, sponsored by DigiKey, and check out the contest page for all the details. In sad news, American Science  Surplus are shuttering online sales, leaving just the brick and mortar stores in Wisconsin and Illinois.\nOn Whats That Sound, its a results show, which means Kristina gets to take a stab at it. She missed the mark, but thats okay, because [Montana Mike] knew that it was the theme music for the show Beakmans World, which was described by one contestant as Bill Nye on crack.\nAfter that, its on to the hacks and such, beginning with a really cool way to smooth your 3D prints in situ. JWe take a much closer look at that talking robots typewriter-inspired mouth from about a month ago. Then we discuss several awesome technological feats such as running code on a PAX credit card payment machine, using the alphabet as joinery, and the invention of UTF-8 in general. Finally, we discuss the detection of spicy shrimp, and marvel at the history of email.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 338 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2025 Hackaday Component Abuse Challenge: Let The Games Begin!\n\nHackaday.IO  Component Abuse Challenge\n\n\nAmerican Science And Surplus Ends Online Sales\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Montana Mike], the Beakmaniest of them all!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nSmooth!

So much so that he builds his own vacuum tubes of various shapes, sizes, and functions right on his own workbench. While the theory of vacuum tubes is pretty straightforward, at least to those of us who havent only been exposed to semiconductors, producing them requires some specialized equipment. A simple vacuum wont get you all the way there, and the complexity of the setup thats needed certainly calls for some automation.\nThe vacuum system that [Nick] uses involves three sections separated by high-vacuum valves in order to achieve the pressures required for vacuum tube construction. Theres a rough vacuum section driven by one pump, a high vacuum section driven by a second pump, and a third section called the evac port where the tube is connected. Each second must be prepared properly before the next section can be engaged or disengaged. An Arduino Pro is tasked with all of this, chosen for its large amount of ADC inputs for the instrumentation monitoring the pressures in each section, as well as the digital I/O to control the valves and switches on the system.\nThe control system is built into a 19-inch equipment rack with custom faceplates which outline the operation of the vacuum system. A set of addressable LEDs provide the status of the various parts of the system, and mechanical keyboard switches are used to control everything, including one which functions as an emergency stop. The automation provided by the Arduino reduces the chances for any mistakes to be caused by human error, allows the human operator to focus on other tasks like forming the glass, and can also react much faster to any potentially damaging situations such as the high-pressure pump being exposed to atmospheric pressure.\n[Nick] might look a little familiar to some of us as well. If you cant quite place him, he did a talk at Hackaday Supercon 2022 detailing all of the intricacies of building ones own vacuum tubes. Since getting into the somewhat niche field of constructing vacuum tubes, hes gone on to produce all kinds of specialty devices and his YouTube channel is definitely worth a watch.\nThanks to [M] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001[Nick]\u306f\u9ad8\u771f\u7a7a\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u3067\u533a\u5207\u3089\u308c\u305f3\u3064\u306e\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u306a\u308b\u771f\u7a7a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5404\u30bb\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u5727\u529b\u3092\u76e3\u8996\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eArduino Pro\u304c\u3001\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u3084\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u3092\u62c5\u5f53\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u4eba\u70ba\u7684\u306a\u30df\u30b9\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30da\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u5f62\u6210\u306a\u3069\u4ed6\u306e\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u96c6\u4e2d\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u9ad8\u5727\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u304c\u5927\u6c17\u5727\u306b\u3055\u3089\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306a\u3069\u306e\u640d\u50b7\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u3082\u3088\u308a\u8fc5\u901f\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3067\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\u30cf\u30a4\u30c6\u30af\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u88fd\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30cf\u30a4\u30f4\u30a1\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u88fd\u9020\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u88c5\u7f6e\uff01\u5c02\u9580\u77e5\u8b58\u3068\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308bYouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb"]}

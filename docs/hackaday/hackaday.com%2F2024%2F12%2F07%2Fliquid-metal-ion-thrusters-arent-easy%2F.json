On the face of things, not much, but after seeing [Zachary Tong]s latest video on liquid metal ion thrusters, we see that they seem to have a lot more in common than wed initially thought.\nAs youd expect with such a project, there were a lot of false starts and dead ends. [Zach] started with a porous-emitter array design, which uses a sintered glass plate with an array of tiny cones machined into it. The cones are coated in a liquid metal  [Zach] used Galinstan, an alloy of gallium, indium, and tin  and an high voltage is applied between the liquid metal and an extraction electrode. Ideally, the intense electric field causes the metal to ionize at the ultra-sharp tips of the cones and fling off toward the extraction electrode and into the vacuum beyond, generating thrust.\nGetting that working was very difficult, enough so that [Zach] gave up and switched to a slot thruster design. This was easier to machine, but alas, no easier to make work. The main problem was taming the high-voltage end of things, which seemed to find more ways to produce unwanted arcs than the desired thrust. This prompted a switch to a capillary emitter design, which uses a fine glass capillary tube to contain the liquid metal. This showed far more promise and allowed [Zach] to infer a thrust by measuring the tiny current created by the ejected ions. At 11.8 \u03bcN, its not much, but its something, and thats the thing with ion thrusters  over time, theyre very efficient.\nTo be sure, [Zach]s efforts here didnt result in a practical ion thruster, but that wasnt the point. We suspect the idea here was to explore the real-world applications for his interests in topics like electron beam lithography and microfabrication, and in that, we think he did a bang-up job with this project.\n\n"}

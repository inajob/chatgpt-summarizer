Its hard to believe, but it looks like over-reliance on chatbots to do your homework can turn your brain into pudding. At least that seems to be the conclusion of a preprint paper out of the MIT Media Lab, which looked at 54 adults between the ages of 18 and 39, who were tasked with writing a series of essays. They divided participants into three groups  one that used ChatGPT to help write the essays, one that was limited to using only Google search, and one that had to do everything the old-fashioned way. They recorded the brain activity of writers using EEG, in order to get an idea of brain engagement with the task. The brain-only group had the greatest engagement, which stayed consistently high throughout the series, while the ChatGPT group had the least. More alarmingly, the engagement for the chatbot group went down even further with each essay written. The ChatGPT group produced essays that were very similar between writers and were judged soulless by two English teachers. Go figure.\n\nThe most interesting finding, though, was when 18 participants from the chatbot and brain-only groups were asked to rewrite one of their earlier essays, with the added twist that the chatbot group had to do it all by themselves, while the brainiacs got to use ChatGPT. The EEGs showed that the first group struggled with the task, presumably because they failed to form any deep memory of their previous work thanks to over-reliance on ChatGPT. The brain-only folks, however, did well at the task and showed signs of activity across all EEG bands. That fits well with our experience with chatbots, which we use to help retrieve specific facts and figures while writing articles, especially ones we know weve seen during our initial scan of the literature but cant find later.\nDoes anyone remember Elektro? We sure do, although not from personal experience, since the seven-foot-tall automaton built by Westinghouse for the Worlds Fair in New York City in 1939 significantly predates our appearance on the planet. But still, the golden-skinned robot that made its living by walking around, smoking, and cracking wise at the audience thanks to a 78-rpm record player in its capacious chest, really made an impression, enough that it toured the country for the better part of 30 years and made the unforgettable Sex Kittens Go to College in 1960 before fading into obscurity. At some point, the one-of-a-kind robot was rescued from a scrap heap and restored to its former glory, and now resides in the North Central Ohio Industrial Museum in Mansfield, very close to the Westinghouse facility that built it. If you need an excuse to visit North Central Ohio, you could do worse than a visit to see Elektro.\n\nIt was with some alarm that we learned this week from Al Williams that mtrek.com 1701 appeared to be down. For those not in the know, mtrek is a Telnet space combat game inspired by the Star Trek franchise, which explains why Al was in such a tizzy about not being able to connect; huge Trek nerd, our Al. Anyway, it appears Als worst fears were unfounded, as we were able to connect to mtrek just fine. But in the process of doing so, we stumbled across this collection of Telnet games and demos thats worth checking out. The mtrek, of course, as well as Telnet versions of chess and backgammon, and an interactive world map that always blows our mind. The site also lists the Telnet GOAT, the Star Wars Asciimation; sadly, that one does seem to be down, at least for us. Sure, you can see it in a web browser, but its not the same as watching it in a terminal over Telnet, is it?\nAnd finally, if youve got 90 minutes or so to spare, you could do worse than to spend it with our friend Hash as he reverse engineers an automotive ECU. We have to admit that we havent indulged yet  its on our playlist for this weekend, because we know how to party. But from what Hash tells us, this is the tortured tale of a job that took far, far longer to complete than expected. We have to admit that while well gladly undertake almost any mechanical repair on most vehicles, automotive ECUs and other electronic modules are almost a bridge too far for us, at least in terms of cracking them open to make even simple repairs. Getting access to them for firmware extraction and parameter fiddling sounds like a lot of fun, and were looking forward to hearing what Hash has to say about the subject.\n", "title": "\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u4f9d\u5b58\u304c\u8133\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u4f9d\u5b58\u304c\u8133\u306e\u6d3b\u6027\u3092\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068MIT\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3067\u793a\u5506\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u4f9d\u5b58\u304c\u8133\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "MIT\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u793a\u3059\u3001\u57f7\u7b46\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3068\u8133\u6d3b\u52d5", "\u6614\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5fa9\u6d3b", "Telnet\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cmtrek\u300d\u3068\u305d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u81ea\u52d5\u8ecaECU\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308bHash\u306e\u7269\u8a9e"]}

Some are built as thought experiments or challenges, like Whitespace or Chicken but arent used for serious programming. There are a few languages that fit in the gray area between these regions, and one example of this is the language MOUSE which can now be run on an Arduino.\nAlthough MOUSE was originally meant to be a minimalist language for computers of the late 70s and early 80s with limited memory (even for the era), its syntax looks more like a more modern esoteric language, and indeed it arguably would take a Python developer a bit of time to get used to it in a similar way. Its stack-based, for a start, and also uses Reverse Polish notation for performing operations. The major difference though is that programs process single letters at a time, with each letter corresponding to a specific instruction. There have been some changes in the computing world since the 80s, though, so [Ivan]s version of MOUSE includes a few changes that make it slightly different than the original language, but in the end he fits an interpreter, a line editor, graphics primitives, and peripheral drivers into just 2KB of SRAM and 32KB Flash so it can run on an ATmega328P.\nThere are some other features here as well, including support for PS/2 devices, video output, and the ability to save programs to the internal EEPROM. Its an impressive setup for a language that doesnt get much attention at all, but certainly one that threads the needle between usefulness and interesting in its own right. Of course if a language where Hello world is human-readable is not esoteric enough, there are others that may offer more of a challenge."}

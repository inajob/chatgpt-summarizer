But what if the rest of your gear isnt 19-inch? Well, then you go out and make it so, just like [Cal Bryant] did recently.\nThe goal was to consolidate multiple devices  DAC, input selector, streamer, and power routing  into a single 2U rackmount unit. His first attempts involved drilling 1U panels to attach gear with removable faceplates. That worked, but not all devices played nice. So his next step became a fully custom enclosure with CAD-modeled brackets and front panels.\nOpenSCAD turned out to be a lifesaver, letting [Cal] design modular mounting solutions. Exporting proper circles for CNC turret punching however appeared to be a nightmare. It was FreeCAD to the rescue for post-processing. After some sanding and auto-shop painting, the final faceplate looked factory-made.\n\nCustom switch boxes for power and audio routing keep things tidy, housing everything from USB to XLR inputs. A 4-pole switch even allows seamless swapping between his DAC and DJ controller, while UV-printed graphics bring the finishing touch to this project. For those looking to clean up their Hi-Fi setup (or just love modding for the sake of it), theres a lot to learn from this build.\nIf buying a rack is not within your budget, you could start with well-known IKEA LACK furniture.", "title": "\u300cDIY\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4e00\u3064\u306b\u307e\u3068\u3081\u308b\uff01 19\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u8a2d\u8a08\u300d", "body": "\u8907\u6570\u6a5f\u5668\u30921\u3064\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308bDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cDIY\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4e00\u3064\u306b\u307e\u3068\u3081\u308b\uff01 19\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u8a2d\u8a08\u300d", "\u300cCAD\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u578b\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u30cf\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u6574\u7406\u6574\u9813\u300d", "\u300cIKEA\u306eLACK\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u624b\u9803\u306a\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u300d", "\u300c\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4e00\u3064\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d"]}

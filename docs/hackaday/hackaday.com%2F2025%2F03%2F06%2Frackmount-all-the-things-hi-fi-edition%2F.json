But what if the rest of your gear isnt 19-inch? Well, then you go out and make it so, just like [Cal Bryant] did recently.\nThe goal was to consolidate multiple devices  DAC, input selector, streamer, and power routing  into a single 2U rackmount unit. His first attempts involved drilling 1U panels to attach gear with removable faceplates. That worked, but not all devices played nice. So his next step became a fully custom enclosure with CAD-modeled brackets and front panels.\nOpenSCAD turned out to be a lifesaver, letting [Cal] design modular mounting solutions. Exporting proper circles for CNC turret punching however appeared to be a nightmare. It was FreeCAD to the rescue for post-processing. After some sanding and auto-shop painting, the final faceplate looked factory-made.\n\nCustom switch boxes for power and audio routing keep things tidy, housing everything from USB to XLR inputs. A 4-pole switch even allows seamless swapping between his DAC and DJ controller, while UV-printed graphics bring the finishing touch to this project. For those looking to clean up their Hi-Fi setup (or just love modding for the sake of it), theres a lot to learn from this build.\nIf buying a rack is not within your budget, you could start with well-known IKEA LACK furniture."}

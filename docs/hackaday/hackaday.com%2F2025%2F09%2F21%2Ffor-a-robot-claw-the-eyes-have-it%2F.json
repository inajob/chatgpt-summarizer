Like, maybe, a second thumb? A scope probe pinky maybe? Well, if you are building a robot effector, you get to pick what extra features it has. [Gokux] has the aptly named\u00a0Cam Claw, which is a 3D printed claw with a built-in camera so you can see exactly what it is doing.\nThe brains are an ESP32-S3 and the eyes  well, the eye technically  uses an OV3660 camera. Theres even a light in case you are in a dark space. A servo drives it, and the printed gear train is pretty fun to watch, as you can see in the video below.\nThis project is all about the mechanics. The electronic hardware is trivial. A battery, a power controller, and a servo complement the ESP32 and camera. Six LEDs for light, and the job is done.\nObviously, the gripping power will only be as good as the servo. However, we really liked the idea of putting eyes on a robot hand where they count. Of course, the claw you really want a camera on is in the arcade. Wed like to see cameras on some other robot appendages.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4ed8\u304d3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u300cCam Claw\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4ed8\u304d\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u300cCam Claw\u300d\u306f\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u624b\u306b\u8996\u899a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4ed8\u304d3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u300cCam Claw\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- ESP32-S3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30af\u30b9", "- \u6697\u95c7\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01LED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30b5\u30fc\u30dc\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3044\u30ae\u30a2\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

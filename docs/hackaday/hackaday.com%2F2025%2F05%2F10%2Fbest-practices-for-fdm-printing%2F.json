[Rahix] decided to write out\u00a0a well-thought-out set of design rules for FDM prints, and we can all benefit.\nOne of the things we liked about the list is that its written in a way that explains everything. Every so often, theres a box with a summarized rule for that topic. At the end, theres a list of all the rules. The rules are also in categories, including part strength, tolerance, optimization, integration, machine elements, appearance, and vase mode.\nFor example, section two deals with tolerance and finish. So, rule R2.8 says, Do not use circular holes for interference fits. Use hexagon or square holes instead.\nWe also appreciate that [Rahix] touched on some of the counter-intuitive aspects of designing for FDM printing. For example, you might think adding voids in your part will reduce the filament and time required to print it, but in many cases it can have the opposite effect.\nSome of these  maybe even most of these  wont surprise you, but you still might take away a tidbit or two. But having it all down in a checklist and then the ability to scroll up and find the rationale for the rule is great.\nDo you have any rules youd add? Or change? Let us know. Meanwhile, we were eyeing our favorites about adding machine elements to prints.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "FDM\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u307e\u3068\u3081\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u5404\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u3084\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc\u5206\u3051\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "FDM\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u57fa\u6e96\u307e\u3068\u3081", "\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a3D\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3068\u30b3\u30c4", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u54c1\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8a2d\u8a08\u30dd\u30ea\u30b7\u30fc"]}

Whether its a DAF, a Ford, a FIAT, or a Chevrolet, most major manufacturers have tried one at some point or another with greater or lesser success. The automotive ones inevitably use a variation on a V-belt or metal band between variable separation conical pulleys, but this is by no means the only CVT configuration. Serial tinkerer [Robert Murray-Smith] takes an in-depth look at the subject as part of his ongoing fascination with wind turbines.\nWhat caught our eye about this video isnt so much the final 3D-printed design he selects for his experiments, but the history and his look at the different CVT designs which have appeared over the years. We see the V-belts, as well as the various cone configurations, the disk transmissions, the hydrostatic ones, and even magnetic versions. His transmission uses two cones with a rubber coating, with of all things a movable golf ball between them. Were guessing it will appear somewhere in his future videos, so watch out for it.\nMeanwhile, this isnt the first time weve seen a CVT, [James Bruton] used a hemisphere to make one on a robot.\n\n", "title": "\u98a8\u529b\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306aCVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u5206\u6790", "body": "CVT\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u30013D\u5370\u5237\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3002\u4ed6\u306e\u958b\u767a\u8005\u3082\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u98a8\u529b\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u306e\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306aCVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u5206\u6790", "\u98a8\u529b\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u7528\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044CVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u53ef\u52d5\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5229\u7528", "\u904e\u53bb\u306eCVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1aV\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3001\u5186\u9310\u5f62\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3001\u6c34\u5727\u3001\u78c1\u6c17\u30d0\u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7279\u7570\u306aCVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u534a\u7403\u306e\u4f7f\u7528", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bCVT\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u52d5\u753b\u5185\u3067\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3068\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u8aac\u660e"]}

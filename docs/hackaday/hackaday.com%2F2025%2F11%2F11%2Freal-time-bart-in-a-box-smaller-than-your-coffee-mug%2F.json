Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) may run like clockwork most days, but a heads-up before you leave the house is always nice. That\u2019s exactly what [filbot] built: a real-time arrival display that looks like it was stolen from the platform itself.\nThe mini replica nails the official vibe  distinctive red text glowing inside a sheet-metal-style enclosure. The case is 3D printed, painted, and dressed up with tiny stickers to match the real deal. For that signature red glow, [filbot] chose a 20\u00d74 character OLED. Since the display wants 5 V logic, a tiny level-shifter sits alongside an ESP32-C6 that runs the show. A lightweight middleware API [filbot] wrote simplifies grabbing just the data he needs from the official BART API and pushes it to the little screen.\nWe love how much effort went into shrinking a full-size transit sign into a desk-friendly package that only shows the info you actually care about. If youre looking for more of an overview, were quite fond of PCB metro maps as well.", "title": "BART\u98a8\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u5230\u7740\u8868\u793a\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "body": "BART\u306e\u9045\u5ef6\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u6a19\u6e96\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u3082\u629c\u7fa4\u3002", "titles": ["BART\u98a8\u306e\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u5230\u7740\u8868\u793a\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u6e80\u8f09\uff01\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306a\u30df\u30cb\u96fb\u8eca\u8868\u793a\u677f", "ESP32-C6\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u4ea4\u901a\u60c5\u5831\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u672c\u7269\u305d\u3063\u304f\u308a\u306e\u96fb\u8eca\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3", "\u8efd\u91cfAPI\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53d6\u5f97\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226"]}

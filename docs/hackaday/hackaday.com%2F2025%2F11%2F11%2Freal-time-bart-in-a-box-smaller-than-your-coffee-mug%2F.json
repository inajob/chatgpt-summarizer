Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) may run like clockwork most days, but a heads-up before you leave the house is always nice. That\u2019s exactly what [filbot] built: a real-time arrival display that looks like it was stolen from the platform itself.\nThe mini replica nails the official vibe  distinctive red text glowing inside a sheet-metal-style enclosure. The case is 3D printed, painted, and dressed up with tiny stickers to match the real deal. For that signature red glow, [filbot] chose a 20\u00d74 character OLED. Since the display wants 5 V logic, a tiny level-shifter sits alongside an ESP32-C6 that runs the show. A lightweight middleware API [filbot] wrote simplifies grabbing just the data he needs from the official BART API and pushes it to the little screen.\nWe love how much effort went into shrinking a full-size transit sign into a desk-friendly package that only shows the info you actually care about. If youre looking for more of an overview, were quite fond of PCB metro maps as well."}

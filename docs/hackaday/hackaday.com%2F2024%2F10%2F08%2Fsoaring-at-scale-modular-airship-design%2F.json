The project, which you can explore in detail here, revolves around a modular airship composed of individual spherical bodies filled with helium or hydrogen\u2014or even a vacuum\u2014arranged in a 3x3x6 grid. The result? A potentially more efficient airship design that could pave the way for lighter-than-air exploration and transport.\nThe innovative setup features flexible connecting tubes linking each sphere to a central gondola, ensuring stable expansion without compromising the airship\u2019s integrity. What\u2019s particularly interesting is [DilshoD]\u2019s use of hybrid spheres: a vacuum shell surrounded by a gas-filled shell. This dual-shell approach adds buoyancy while reducing overall weight, possibly making the craft more maneuverable than traditional airships. By leveraging materials like latex used in radiosonde balloons, this design also promises accessibility for makers, hackers, and tinkerers.\nThough this concept was originally submitted as a patent in Uzbekistan, it was unfortunately rejected. Nevertheless, [DilshoD] is keen to see the design find new life in the hands of Hackaday readers. Imagine the possibilities with a modular airship that can be tailored for specific applications.

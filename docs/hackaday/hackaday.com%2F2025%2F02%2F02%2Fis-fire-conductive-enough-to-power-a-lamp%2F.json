As ridiculous that may sound at first glance, from a physics perspective the rapid oxidation process we call fire produces a lot of substances that can reduce the electrical insulating (dielectric) properties of air. Is this change enough to allow for significant current to pass? To test this, [The Action Lab] on YouTube ran some experiments after being called out on this apparent fact in the comments to an earlier video.\nUltimately what you need to make fire conductive is to have an appreciable amount of plasma to reduce the dielectric constant, which means that you cannot just use any rapid oxidation process. In the demonstration with lights and what appears to be a (relatively clean-burning) butane torch, the current conducted is not enough to light up an incandescent or LED light bulb, but can light up a 5 mm LED. When using his arm as a de-facto sensor, it does not conduct enough current to be noticeable.\nThe more interesting experiment here demonstrates the difference in dielectric breakdown of air at different temperatures. As the dielectric constant for hot air is much lower than for room temperature air, even a clean burning torch is enough to register on a multimeter. Ultimately this seems to be the biggest hazard with fire around exposed (HV) electrical systems, as the ionic density of most types of fire just isnt high enough.\nTo reliably strike a conductive plasma arc, youd need something like explosive (copper) wire and a few thousand joules to pump through it.\n\n", "title": "- \u706b\u306f\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u691c\u8a3c", "body": "\u706b\u306f\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u901a\u3059\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u9ad8\u6e29\u3067\u306f\u7a7a\u6c17\u306e\u8a98\u96fb\u7387\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u706b\u306f\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u3092\u6301\u3064\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3067\u691c\u8a3c", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u306e\u751f\u6210\u304c\u706b\u306e\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u306b\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u9ad8\u6e29\u306e\u7a7a\u6c17\u3068\u706b\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u7684\u7279\u6027\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- \u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u70b9\u706f\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u706b\u306e\u5c0e\u96fb\u6027\u9650\u754c", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u5468\u8fba\u306e\u706b\u707d\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b"]}

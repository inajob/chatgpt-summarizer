This wasnt an accessible PCIe bus normally available in things like desktop computers for expansion cards, though; this seemed to be done entirely internally. But a few attempts were made to break out the PCIe capabilities and connect peripherals to it anyway, with varying levels of success. The new Pi 5 seems to have taken that idea to its logical conclusion and included a PCIe connector, and [George] is showing us a way to interface with this bus.\nThe bus requires the port to be enabled, but once thats done its ready to be used. First, though, some support circuitry needs to be worked out which is why [George] is reverse engineering the system to see whats going on under the hood. There are a few handshakes that happen before it will work with any peripherals, but with that out of the way a PCIe card can be connected. [George] removed the connector to solder wires to the board directly in order to connect a proper PCIe port allowing a variety of cards to be connected, in this case a wireless networking card and an old Firewire card. This specific build only allows Gen 1 speeds, but the bus itself supports faster connections in theory with better wiring and support circuitry.\nWhile it might not be the prettiest solution, as [George] admits, it does a great job of showing the inner workings of this communication protocol and its use in the new, more powerful Raspberry Pi 5. This makes a lot of things more accessible, such as high-speed PCIe HATs allowing for a wide range of expansion for these popular single-board computers, which wouldnt have been possible before. If youre still stuck with a Pi 4, though, dont despair. You can still access the PCIe bus on these older models but itll take a little bit more work.\nThanks to [CJay] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi 5: \u30d0\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "body": "Raspberry Pi 5 includes a PCIe connector, allowing peripherals to be connected.

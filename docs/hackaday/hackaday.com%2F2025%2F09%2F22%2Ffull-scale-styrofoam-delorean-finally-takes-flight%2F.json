Its airborne and on camera in the video embedded below.\nWeve written about this project before first about the mega-sized CNC router [Brian] used to carve the DeLorean body out of Styrofoam panels, and an update last year that showed the aluminum frame and motorized louvers and doors.\nWell, the iconic gull-wing doors are still there, and still motorized, and theyve been joined by a tire-tilting mechanism for a Back To The Future film-accurate flight mode. With the wheels down, the prop can use them to steer and drive, looking for all the world like an all-white DMC-12.\nThe aluminum frame we covered before is no longer in the picture, though. Its been replaced by a lighter, stiffer version made from carbon fibre. Its still a ladder frame, but now with carbon fiber tubes and forged carbon fiber corners made of tow and resin packed in 3D printed molds. Theres been a tonne of work documented on the build log since we last covered this project, so be sure to check it out for all the details.\nEven in unpainted white Styrofoam, its surreal to see this thing take off; its the ultimate in practical effects, and totally worth the wait. Honestly, with talent like [Brian] out there its a wonder anyone still bothers with CGI, economics aside.\nThanks to [Brian] for the tip! If you have a project youve hit a milestone with, wed love to see it, even if it doesnt trigger the 80s nostalgia gland we apparently all have embedded in our brains these days. Send us a tip!\n\n\n"}

The Computer History Archives Project has a partially restored film of [Mr. Wizard] showing off sounds and noise on a state-of-the-art (for 1963) Tektronix 504 oscilloscope. He talks about noise and also shows the famous IBM mainframe rendition of the song Daisy Bell. You can see the video along with some extras below.\nYou might recall that the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey paid homage to the IBM computers singing debut by having HAL 9000 sing the same song as it is being deactivated. The idea that HAL was IBM minus one has been repeatedly denied, but we still remain convinced.\n\nCan you imagine a TV show these days that would teach kids about signal-to-noise ratio or even show them an actual oscilloscope? We suppose thats what YouTube is for.\nAt about the 17-minute mark, you can see some enormous walkie-talkies. A far cry from todays cell phones. At the 27-minute mark, another film shows how engineers at Bell created the song using a mainframe.\nWe wish there were a modern version of [Mr. Wizard]. Then again, theres no reason you cant fill in. You might not be on TV, but you can always drop in on a few classrooms.\n", "title": "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u305f\u300eMr. Wizard\u300f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "body": "\u300c\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u306f\u79d1\u5b66\u3092\u697d\u3057\u304f\u6559\u3048\u308b\u756a\u7d44\u3067\u3001\u6280\u8853\u6559\u6750\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4f1d\u3048\u305f\u300eMr. Wizard\u300f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "- \u300c\u300eMr. Wizard\u300f\u3068\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\uff1a1963\u5e74\u306e\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u300d", "- \u300c\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u306b\u79d1\u5b66\u3092\u6559\u3048\u305f\u300eMr. Wizard\u300f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u9858\u3063\u3066\u300d", "- \u300c\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u300eMr. Wizard\u300f\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff1aYouTube\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u4fe1\u53f7\u3068\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u300d", "- \u300cIBM\u306e\u6b4c\u3046\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u3068\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\u300d"]}

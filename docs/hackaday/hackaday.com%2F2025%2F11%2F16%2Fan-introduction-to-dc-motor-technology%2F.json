If this is on your to learn list, or you just want a refresher, you can watch the video below. Itll be ten minutes well-spent.\nThe video covers the whole technology stack behind the humble DC motor in its various incarnations. Starting with basic magnetic effects, it then proceeds through 2-wire brushed DC motors and finally into 3-wire brushless DC motors (BLDC motors).\n\nIts worth knowing that the 3-wires in a BLDC motor are for three power phases; they are not, as in an RC servo, positive, negative, and signal leads. But, confusingly, the BLDC motors in your PC fans do have positive, negative, and signal pins. But thats because, like an RC servo, the fans have controllers built into the case.\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for writing in about this one.

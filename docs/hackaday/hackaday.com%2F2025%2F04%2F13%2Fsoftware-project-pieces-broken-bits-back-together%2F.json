Its whole job is to look at the pieces of a broken object and accurately figure out how to fit the pieces back together, even if there are some missing bits or the edges arent clean.\nRe-assembling an object from imperfect fragments is a nontrivial undertaking.\nEfficiently and accurately figuring out how to re-assemble different pieces into a whole is not a trivial task. One may think it can in theory be brute-forced, but the complexity of such a job rapidly becomes immense. Thats where machine learning methods come in, as researchers created a system that can do exactly that. It addresses the challenge of generalizing from a synthetic data set (in which computer-generated objects are broken and analyzed for training) and successfully applying it to the kinds of highly complex breakage patterns that are seen in real-world objects like bones, recovered archaeological artifacts, and more.\nThe system is essentially a highly adept 3D puzzle solver, but an entirely different beast from something like this jigsaw puzzle solving pick-and-place robot. Instead of working on flat pieces with clean, predictable edges it handles 3D scanned fragments with complex break patterns even if the edges are imperfect, or there are missing pieces.\nGARF is exactly the kind of software framework that is worth keeping in the back of ones mind just in case it comes in handy some day. The GitHub repository contains the code (although at this moment the custom dataset is not yet uploaded) but there is also a demo available for the curious."}

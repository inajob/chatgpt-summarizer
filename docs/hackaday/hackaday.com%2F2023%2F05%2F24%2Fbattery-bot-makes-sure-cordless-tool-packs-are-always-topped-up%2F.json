But now, cordless power tools have proliferated to the point where the mere thought of using a plain old wrist-twisting screwdriver is enough to trigger a bout of sympathetic repetitive injury. And the only thing worse than that is to discover that the batteries for your tools are all dead.\nAs [Lance] from the Sparks and Code channel freely admits, the fact that his impressive collection of batteries is always dead is entirely his fault, and thats what inspired his automatic battery charging robot. The design is pretty clever; depleted batteries go into a hopper, under which is a 3D-printed sled. Batteries drop down into the sled, which runs the battery out from under the hopper to the charging station, which is just the guts of an old manual charger attached to a lead screw to adjust the height of the charging terminals for different size batteries. When the battery is charged, the sled pushes it a little further into an outfeed hopper before going back to get another battery from the infeed side.\nOf course, that all vastly understates the amount of work [Lance] had to put into this. He suffered through a lot of integration hell problems, like getting the charger properly connected to the Arduino running the automation. But with a lot of tweaking, he can now just dump in a bunch of depleted packs and let the battery bot handle everything. The video after the break shows all the gory details.\nOf course, theres another completely different and much simpler solution to the dead battery problem.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5316\u304b", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305fYouTuber\u3001Sparks and Code\u306eLance\u3002\u56de\u53ce\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u5165\u308c\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u306b\u843d\u3061\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u5145\u96fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u307e\u3067\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u904b\u3073\u3001\u5145\u96fb\u304c\u5b8c\u4e86\u3057\u305f\u3089\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u51fa\u529b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002Lance\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u81ea\u8eab\u304c\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5145\u96fb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3001\u3053\u306e\u767a\u6848\u306b\u81f3\u3063\u305f\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u5225\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3082\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5316\u304b", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u5de5\u5177\u306e\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u5145\u96fb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u7269\u8a9e", "\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6295\u5165\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\uff01\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5145\u96fb\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308bSLED\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5145\u96fb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

This is really the difference between doing science and just messing around: if you want to test or improve on a procedure, you have to be able to measure how well it works.\nWhen he puts his home-made magnet into the device, Ben finds out that he\u2019s made a basically mediocre magnet, compared with samples out of his amply stocked magnet drawer. But that\u2019s a great first data point, and more importantly, the magnetometer build gives him a way of gauging future improvements.\nOf course there\u2019s a time and a place for \u201cgood enough is good enough\u201d, and you can easily spend more time building the measurement apparatus for a particular project than simply running the experiment, but that\u2019s not science. Have you ever gone down the measurement rabbit hole, spending more time validating or characterizing the effect than you do on producing it in the first place?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

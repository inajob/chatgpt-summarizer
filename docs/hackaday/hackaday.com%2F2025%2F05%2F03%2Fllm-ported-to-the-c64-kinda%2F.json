Yet, you could run one, if you so desired, thanks to [ytm] and the Llama2.c64 project!\n[ytm] did the hard work of porting the Llama 2 model to the most popular computer ever made. Of course, as you might expect, the ancient 8-bit machine doesnt really have the stones to run an LLM on its own. You will need one rather significant upgrade, in the form of 2 MB additional RAM via a C64 REU.\nNow, dont get ahead of things\u2014this is no wide-ranging ChatGPT clone. Its not going to do your homework, counsel you on your failed marriage, or solve the geopolitical crisis in your local region.

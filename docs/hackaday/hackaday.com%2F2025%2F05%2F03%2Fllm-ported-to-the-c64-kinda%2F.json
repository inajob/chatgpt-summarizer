Yet, you could run one, if you so desired, thanks to [ytm] and the Llama2.c64 project!\n[ytm] did the hard work of porting the Llama 2 model to the most popular computer ever made. Of course, as you might expect, the ancient 8-bit machine doesnt really have the stones to run an LLM on its own. You will need one rather significant upgrade, in the form of 2 MB additional RAM via a C64 REU.\nNow, dont get ahead of things\u2014this is no wide-ranging ChatGPT clone. Its not going to do your homework, counsel you on your failed marriage, or solve the geopolitical crisis in your local region. Instead, youre getting the 260 K tinystories model, which is a tad more limited. In [ytm]s words Imagine prompting a 3-year-old child with the beginning of a story \u2014 they will continue it to the best of their vocabulary and abilities.\nIt might not be supremely capable, but theres something fun about seeing such a model talking back on an old-school C64 display. If youve been hacking away at your own C64 projects, dont hesitate to let us know. We certainly cant get enough of them!\nThanks to [ytm] for the tip!", "title": "- Commodore 64\u306b\u8a00\u8a9e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30b3\u30e2\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb64\u3067Llama2\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u30022MB\u306eRAM\u5897\u8a2d\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u9650\u5b9a\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- Commodore 64\u306b\u8a00\u8a9e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Llama2.c64\uff1a\u53e4\u5178\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3078\u306eAI\u6311\u6226", "- 8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3067\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u305d\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- C64\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306aRAM\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u9053", "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304dC64\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30c6\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f"]}

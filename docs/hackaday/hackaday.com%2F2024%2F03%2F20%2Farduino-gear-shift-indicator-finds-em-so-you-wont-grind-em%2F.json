It certainly didnt require a lot of help with the shifting pattern, at least not enough to require a technical solution to know what gear youre in. But then again, we suspect thats not really the point of [upir]s latest build.\nOh sure, its pretty cool to display your current gear selection on a little LCD screen using an Arduino. And [upir] promises a follow-up project where the display goes inside the shifter knob, which will be really cool. But if you take a look at the video below, youll see that the real value of this project is the stepwise approach he takes to create this project. [upir] spends most of the time in the video below simulating the hardware and the code of the project in Wokwi, which lets him make changes and tune the design up before committing anything to actual hardware.\nThat turned out to be particularly useful with this build since he chose to use analog Hall sensors to detect the shift lever position and didnt know exactly how that would work. Wokwi let him quickly build a virtual prototype for one sensor (using a potentiometer as a stand-in, since the simulator lacked a Hall sensor model), then quickly expand to the four sensors needed to detect all six gear positions.\nBy the time his simulation was complete, the code was almost entirely written. [upir] also walks us through his toolchains for both designing the graphics and laying out the PCB, a non-trivial task given the odd layout. We particularly enjoyed the tip on making smooth curved traces around the oval cutout for the shift lever in the board.\nThe video below is on the longish side, but its chock full of great little tips. Check out some more of [upir]s work, like his pimped-out potentiometer or his custom animations on 162 LCDs.\n\n"}

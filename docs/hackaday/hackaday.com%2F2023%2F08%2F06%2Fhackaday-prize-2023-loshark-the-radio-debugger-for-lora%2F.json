There are some great embedded devices based around STM32, NRF52, and ESP32 microcontrollers. Whats been missing for quite a while is a device that allows for full access to a LoRa radio from a more capable CPU. The wait may be over, as theres now the LoShark. Its a USB key form factor, with a MIPS processor running a real Linux kernel. Cool!\nThe way debugging works is interesting, too. The team at SudoMaker is working on their Resonance runtime, which allows interacting with the onboard sx126x radio chip using JavaScript code. That chip can both send and receive, so this device should be capable of more than just capturing traffic. And if JavaScript isnt your thing, the Linux system on the device means you can knock yourself out with C or C++ code. Who knows, we may even see Meshtastic running on this thing some day.\nIf this gets you excited, its already available for order for a reasonable $59.99. The LoShark ships in 433, 868, and 915 megahertz versions. Its a really slick looking device, and maybe worth your time to check out. Enjoy!\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

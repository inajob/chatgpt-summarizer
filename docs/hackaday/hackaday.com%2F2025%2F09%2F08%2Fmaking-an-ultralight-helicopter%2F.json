These quite often cheap and cheerful DIY aircraft often hide some excellent engineering underneath. This is no more true than in [ultralight helicopters] four-year-long helicopter build saga!\nWhile most ultralight builds are fixed-wing, a rotocraft can meet all the legal definitions of ultralight aviation. This helicopter is an excellent example of whats possible with a lot of time and patience. The construction is largely aluminium with some stainless steel on the skids. A 64-horsepower Rotax 582UL engine powers the two-bladed main rotor and tail rotor. The drivetrain features a multi-belt engine coupler and three gearboxes to ensure correct power output to the two rotors.\n\nIt features a control layout familiar to any helicopter pilot with foot pedals that control the rotor pitch for anti-torque control. A cyclic in front of the pilot controls the rotors cyclical movements, resulting in forward and sideways flight control. A collective with integrated throttle controls the overall main rotor pitch for altitude and climb control. Finally, a simple clutch sits next to the collective for engine start and idles.\nThe build was meticulous, with nearly everything from the swashplate to the gearboxes custom-machined. The balance and alignment of everything, from the rotor blades to the input trim, had to be checked. The build is a masterpiece of home workshop engineering.\nWeve seen ultralights before, so make sure to check out this electric fixed-wing ultralight next! Or, if you want really light, try foam.\n", "title": "- DIY\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u822a\u7a7a\u3067\u306f\u3001\u514d\u8a31\u306a\u3057\u3067\u98db\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- DIY\u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6311\u6226", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u3068\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "- \u30d8\u30ea\u30b3\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u64cd\u7e26\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7d71", "- \u5b8c\u5168\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u5de5\u623f\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f"]}

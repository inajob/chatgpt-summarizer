While [VoltLogs] review of the Topdon TC002 was interesting though, it has a connector for an iPhone. Even if you arent on Android, there is a rumor that Apple may (or may be forced to) change connectors which will make it more difficult to connect. Of course, there will be adapters, and you can get a USB C version of the same camera.\nTechnically, the camera is pretty typical of other recent cameras in this price range, and they probably all use the same image sensor. The camera provides 256192 images.\n\nWhere the cameras differ is usually in the software and supporting hardware. For example, [VoltLog] was impressed with the softwares ability to allow you to adjust the overlay of the real image with the IR image. This capability is not unique, but the implementation was well done. He was also impressed with the packaging.\nHe did mention that the camera isnt set up to do PCB inspection, which is mostly what we would want it for. However, for some uses, this camera seems like it would be functional. He did suggest you try the USB C version unless you are certain you only want to use it with an iPhone.\nSince most of the cameras use the same basic sensor, there are few surprises in a review like this. However, it is nice to be able to see the differences in software, packaging, and lensing between different options.\nOf course, once you have one of these, it is something else to obsess over calibrating. If 256192 seems too rich for you, maybe try an 88 sensor.\n\n"}

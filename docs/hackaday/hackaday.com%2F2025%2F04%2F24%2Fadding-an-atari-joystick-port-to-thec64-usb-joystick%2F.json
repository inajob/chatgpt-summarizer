[10p6] enjoys hacking on this platform, and recently whipped up a new mod  adding a 9-pin Atari joystick connector for convenience.\nWhen it comes to TheC64 units, they ship with joysticks that look retro, but arent. These joysticks actually communicate with the hardware over USB. [10p6]s hack was to add an additional 9-pin Atari joystick connector into the joystick itself. Its a popular mod amongst owners of TheC64 and the C64 Mini. All one needs to do is hook up a 9-pin connector to the right points on the joysticks PCB. Then, it effectively acts as a pass-through adapter for hooking up other joysticks to the system.\nWhile this hack could have been achieved by simply chopping away at the plastic housing of the original joystick, [10p6] went a tidier route. Instead, the joystick was granted a new 3D printed base that had a perfect mounting spot for the 9-pin connector. Clean!\nWeve seen some great hacks from [10p6] lately, like the neat reimagined C64C build that actually appears in this project video, too.\n\n\n"}

[10p6] enjoys hacking on this platform, and recently whipped up a new mod  adding a 9-pin Atari joystick connector for convenience.\nWhen it comes to TheC64 units, they ship with joysticks that look retro, but arent. These joysticks actually communicate with the hardware over USB. [10p6]s hack was to add an additional 9-pin Atari joystick connector into the joystick itself. Its a popular mod amongst owners of TheC64 and the C64 Mini. All one needs to do is hook up a 9-pin connector to the right points on the joysticks PCB. Then, it effectively acts as a pass-through adapter for hooking up other joysticks to the system.\nWhile this hack could have been achieved by simply chopping away at the plastic housing of the original joystick, [10p6] went a tidier route. Instead, the joystick was granted a new 3D printed base that had a perfect mounting spot for the 9-pin connector. Clean!\nWeve seen some great hacks from [10p6] lately, like the neat reimagined C64C build that actually appears in this project video, too.\n\n\n", "title": "- TheC64\u306b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6539\u9020", "body": "TheC64\u306e\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u6539\u9020\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u57fa\u90e8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["- TheC64\u306b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6539\u9020", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\uff01TheC64\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fTheC64\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u6539\u9020", "- C64\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\uff1a\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "- [10p6]\u306e\u5de7\u5999\u306aTheC64\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

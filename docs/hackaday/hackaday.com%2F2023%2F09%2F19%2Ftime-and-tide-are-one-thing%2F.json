But none has been so vital to comedy as say, printing hats for sea urchins. Thats right, sea urchins like to cover up with various things and will happily don, say, a 3D printed hat if presented the opportunity.\nSo anyway, this is a tide clock that uses a printed sea urchin and various hats to tell the time until/between low and high tide. How? It uses the position of a given hat relative to a couple nOOds LED strands, one for high tide and another for low.\nInside the large bamboo enclosure is an TTGO that fetches cheaply-obtained tide information and displays it on the screen. The TTGO also controls a servo that moves the sea urchin around. As it moves, a magnet in the urchins head (?) attracts the next hat.\nBefore settling on the current design, [rabbitcreek] experimented with both a sand dollar and a sea urchin skeleton. All the files are available if you want to whip up your own.\nThis isnt [rabbitcreek]s first foray into tide clocks. Heres a solar number that should last for years."}

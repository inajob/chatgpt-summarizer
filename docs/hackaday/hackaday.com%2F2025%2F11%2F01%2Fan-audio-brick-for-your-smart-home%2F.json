Or, you could go the more DIY route and whip up something like the Esparagus Audio Brick built by [Andriy].\u00a0\nThe concept is simple\u2014its a small unit, roughly the size of a brick, which streams high-quality audio. Its based around an ESP32, which pulls in digital audio over Wi-Fi or Ethernet. The microcontroller is hooked up to a TAS5825M DAC, which comes with a built-in amplifier for convenience. The Esparagus is designed for integration with Home Assistant, allowing for easy control as part of a smart home setup. Its also compatible with Spotify Connect, AirPlay, and Snapcast\u2014the latter of which provides excellent sync when using multiple units across several rooms.\nDesign files are available on Github for the curious. Weve seen other neat projects in this space, before, too\u2014like the charmingly-named OtterCast.

Our predilection for crossed wrenches had (almost) nothing to do with it.\nWeve got a soft spot for logos that work well on dark web pages.\nDesigned to mimic the ubiquitous Recycle logo, [Yves] originally created the icon for Repair Caf\u00e9 Roeselare  but realizing that it had wide practical applications, he got the OK to put it up on GitHub for others to use. Whether youre a hobbyist creating your first PCB or a pro designing a commercial product for a particularly forward-thinking client, slapping this logo on signifies that your creation is destined for better things than the scrap heap.\n[Yves] has helpfully provided the logo in both vector format (SVG) and PNG, the latter at several scales for your convenience. Wed love to see it offered in various production and CAD formats as well, so it can be dropped into as many projects as possible. So if you end up creating a DXF or STL version, be sure to submit a pull request.\nWhile getting others onboard with this logo is just a ground roots effort currently, who knows what the future may bring? Today we take it for granted, but the official open source hardware gear logo has only been around for about a decade."}

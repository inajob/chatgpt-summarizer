The basic idea is to use a thermocouple, but  in this case  he uses a Peltier effect cooler.\nThe Peltier and Seebeck effects are two sides of the same coin: the Peltier effect creates heating and cooling when current flows through a thermoelectric material. In contrast, the Seebeck effect generates a voltage when there is a temperature gradient. While thermocouples do produce voltage this way, they usually have much lower power output and are useless as heat pumps.\n\nThermoelectric heat pumps  Peltier devices  use semiconductors, which allow them to reach higher temperature differences when used as a heat pump, and also perform better than a conventional metal thermocouple in reverse operation.\nGenerating power from waste heat is nothing new. Is it harder to do this with thermocouples? Yes. Yes, it is.\n"}

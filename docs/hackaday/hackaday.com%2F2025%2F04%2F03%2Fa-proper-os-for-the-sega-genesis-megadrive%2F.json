They are both famous for their games, but in terms of software they can only run whats on a cartridge. The Genesis has a Motorola 68000 on board though, which is capable of far more than just\u00a0Sonic the Hedgehog. [EythorE] evidently thinks so, because heres a port of Fusix, a UNIX-like OS, for the Sega platform.\nAs it stands, the OS is running on the BlastEm emulator, but given a Sega Saturn keyboard or a modified PC keyboard for the Sega, it could be run on real hardware. What you get is a basic UNIX-like OS with a working shell and the usual UNIX utilities. With 64k of memory to play with this will never be a powerhouse, but on the other hand wed be curious to see it in a working cartridge.\nMeanwhile, if the console interests you further, someone has been into its workings in great detail.\n\nHeader: Evan-Amos, CC BY-SA 3.0."}

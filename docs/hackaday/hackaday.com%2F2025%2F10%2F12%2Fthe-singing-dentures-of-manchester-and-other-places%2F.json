Its very much a thing that the most unlikely of circuits can function as radio receivers, but teeth? [Ringway Manchester] investigates tales of musical dental work.\nGoing through a series of news reports over the decades, including one of Lucille Ball uncovering a hidden Japanese spy transmitter, its something all experts who have looked at the issue have concluded there is little evidence for. It was also investigated by Mythbusters. But its an alluring tale, so is it entirely fabricated? What we can say is that teeth are sensitive to sound, not in themselves, but because the jaw provides a good path bringing vibrations to the region of the ear. And its certainly possible that the active chemical environment surrounding a metal filling in a patients mouth could give rise to electrical non-linearities. But could a human body in an ordinary RF environment act as a good enough antenna to provide enough energy for something to happen? We have our doubts.\nIts a perennial story (even in fiction), though, and were guessing that proof will come over the coming decades. If the tales of dental music and DJs continue after AM (or Long Wave in Europe) transmissions have been turned off, then its likely theyre more in the mind than in the mouth. If not, then we might have missed a radio phenomenon. The video is below the break.\n\n\nDental orthopantomogram: Temehetmebmk, CC BY-SA 4.0."}

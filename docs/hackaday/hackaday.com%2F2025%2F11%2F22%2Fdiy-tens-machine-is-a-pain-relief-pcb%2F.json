A trickle of current that can deal with chronic pain better than the pills weve been using for decades? Yeah, and what chakras do you hook this doo-hickie up to? It seems too good to be true, but in fact its a well-supported therapy that has become part of scientific medicine. There are no crystals needed, and youre applying electrodes to the effected area, not your chakras. Like all medical devices, it can be expensive if you have to buy the machine out-of-pocket but it is just a trickle of current. [Leon Hillmann] shows us its well within the range of hackability, so why not DIY?\n[Leon]s TENS machine is specifically designed to help a relative with hand problems, so breaks out electrodes for each finger, with one on the palm serving as a common ground. This type of TENS is monophasic that is, DC, which is easier than balancing current flowing in two directions through quivering flesh. The direct current is provided at 32 V to the digit electrodes, safely kept to a constant amperage with a transistor-based current limiting circuit. The common ground in the palm is pulsed at a rate set by an ATmega32U4 and thus controllable: 14 Hz is given as an example.\nObviously if you want to reproduce this work youre doing it at your own risk and need to consult with relevant medical professionals (blah blah blah, caveat gluteus maximus) but this particular sort of medical device is a good fit for the average hacker. Aside from prosthetics, we havent seen that much serious medical hacking since the pandemic. Still, like with synthesizing medical drugs, this is the kind of thing you probably dont want to vibe code.", "title": "- TENS\u6a5f\u5668\u3092DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u6162\u6027\u7684\u306a\u75db\u307f\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "TENS\u306f\u6162\u6027\u75db\u306e\u6cbb\u7642\u306b\u6709\u52b9\u306a\u96fb\u6c17\u523a\u6fc0\u7642\u6cd5\u3067\u3001DIY\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- TENS\u6a5f\u5668\u3092DIY\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u6162\u6027\u7684\u306a\u75db\u307f\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u795e\u7d4c\u523a\u6fc0\u7642\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u533b\u7642\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u624b\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eTENS\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u5236\u4f5c", "- ATmega32U4\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305fTENS\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u533b\u7642\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1aTENS\u306e\u88cf\u5074"]}

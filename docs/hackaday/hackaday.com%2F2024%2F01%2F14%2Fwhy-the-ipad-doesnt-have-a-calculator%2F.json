Its absence on the iPads iPadOS is strange since the iPhones (iOS) have always had a calculator application built into the system.\u00a0 Even Apples laptop and desktop systems (MacOS/OS X/MacOS) include a calculator.\u00a0 As [Greg] at [Apple Explained] explains in a 2021 video, this seems to have originally been due to Steve Jobs, who didnt like the scaled-up iOS calculator that the person in charge of iPad software development  [Scott Forstal]  and set an ultimatum to replace or drop it.\nIn the video, [Greg] shows sections of an interview with Apple software chief [Craig Federighi], who when confronted with the question of why iPadOS doesnt have a calculator or weather app quickly slithers out of the way of the incoming question. He excuses the absence with the idea that Apple wont do anything unless it makes people go wow when they use it. Fast-forward two years, and iPadOS 17 still doesnt have a version of the Apple Calculator app, making for rich meme fodder. One question that gets raised by some is whether Apple really needs to make such an app at all, since you can use Spotlight and Siri to get calculations resolved, in the latter case using the apparently hidden Calculator app.\nThese days you can use Google Search as a calculator too, with it even throwing up a calculator UI when you ask it to perform a calculation, and the App Store is full of various calculator apps, with or without advertising and/or paid features. In this context, what could Apple do with a calculator that would positively wow its users?\n\n", "title": "\u300ciPad\u306b\u306f\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u306a\u3044\uff1f\uff01\u300d- Apple\u306e\u8a08\u753b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u610f\u56f3\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "body": "iPad\u306b\u306f\u96fb\u5353\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\u305d\u306e\u7406\u7531\u306fSteve Jobs\u306e\u610f\u5411\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3002\u4ee3\u66ff\u624b\u6bb5\u3068\u3057\u3066Spotlight\u3084Siri\u304c\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u304c\u3001App Store\u306b\u3082\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u96fb\u5353\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3067\u306f\u3001Apple\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3044\u3063\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5353\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u306e\u304b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300ciPad\u306b\u306f\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u306a\u3044\uff1f\uff01\u300d- Apple\u306e\u8a08\u753b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u610f\u56f3\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "iPad\u3068\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u6027- Steve Jobs\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068iPadOS\u306e\u7279\u7570\u6027", "Apple\u306e\u4e88\u60f3\u5916\u306a\u9078\u629e- iPad\u306b\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u6b20\u5982\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f", "iPad\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u9a12\u7136- Apple\u304c\u306a\u305c\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u306a\u3044\u306e\u304b\u7591\u554f\u8996\u3055\u308c\u308b", "Apple\u306e\u8a08\u753b\u306b\u4e00\u4f53\u4f55\u304c\uff1f- iPad\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

Whichever you prefer, a common problem is that they dont offer much in the way of solid connections to the outside world. You could use break-out boards, or you could do like [Pakequis] and make a prototyping board with every connector you can think of ready to go.\nThe board features the expected prototyping space in the middle, and we werent joking when we said every connector. There are analogue, serial, USB, headers aplenty, footprints for microcontroller boards, an Arduino shield, a Raspberry Pi header, and much more. There will doubtless be ones that readers will spot as missing, but its a pretty good selection.\nWe can imagine that with a solderless breadboard stuck in the middle it could be a very useful aid for teaching electronics, and we think it would give more than a few commercial boards a run for their money. Its not the first weve featured, either.\n\n", "title": "- \u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u305d\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- \u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u6559\u80b2\u306b\u3082\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u88fd\u4f5c\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "- \u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

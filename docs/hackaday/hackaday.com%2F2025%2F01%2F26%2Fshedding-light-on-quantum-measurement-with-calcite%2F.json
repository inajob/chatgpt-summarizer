You\u2019re not alone. Enter this guide by [Mithuna] from Looking Glass Universe, where she circles back on the concept of\u00a0 measurement basis in quantum mechanics using a rather simple piece of calcite crystal. We wrote about similar endeavours in reflection on Shanni Prutchis talk at the Hackaday SuperConference in 2015. If that memory got a bit dusty in your mind, heres a quick course to make things click again.\nIn essence, calcite splits a beam of light into two dots based on polarization. By aligning filters and rotating angles, you can observe how light behaves when forced into choices. The dots you see are a direct representation of the light\u2019s polarization states. Now this isn\u2019t just a neat trick for photons; it\u2019s a practical window into the probability-driven nature of quantum systems.\nEven with just one photon passing through per second, the calcite setup demonstrates how light chooses a path, revealing the probabilistic essence of quantum mechanics. Using common materials (laser pointers, polarizing filters, and calcite), anyone can reproduce this experiment at home.\nIf this sparks curiosity, explore Hackaday\u2019s archives for quantum mechanics. Or just find yourself a good slice of calcite online, steal the laser pointer from your cats toy bin, and get going!\n\n", "title": "- \u30ab\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u91cf\u5b50\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5165\u9580", "body": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u6982\u5ff5\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u65b9\u89e3\u77f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u5149\u306e\u504f\u5149\u72b6\u614b\u304c\u89b3\u5bdf\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ab\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u91cf\u5b50\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5165\u9580", "- \u5149\u306e\u504f\u5149\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66", "- \u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u6982\u5ff5\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u91cf\u5b50\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u5b9f\u8df5\uff01\u30ab\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u91cf\u5b50\u306e\u78ba\u7387\u306e\u63a2\u6c42"]}

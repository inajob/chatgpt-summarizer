Today, theyre absolute powerhouses, efficiently turning a flow of electrons into a searing beam of light. Despite their efficiency, they can still put out a fair whack of heat. Thus, if youre building a powerful flashlight like [CrazyScience], you might wanna throw some active cooling on there just to keep things happy. Check out the video below.\nThe build will not be unfamiliar to any casual observer of the modern DIY flashlight scene. It uses a flatpack LED module of great brightness and a wad of 18650 lithium-ion cells to provide the juice to run it. The LED itself is mounted in a 3D-printed frame, which leaves its rear exposed, and a small PC fan is mounted for air cooling. Its not the most optimized design, as airflow out of the fan is somewhat restricted by the 3D-printed housing, but its a lot better than simple passive cooling. It allows the torch to be more compact without requiring a huge heatsink to keep the LED at an acceptable temperature.\nThe final torch doesnt have the most ergonomic form factor, but it does work. However, as a learning project for a new maker, its a start, and the learning value of building something functional cant be understated. If your desire for flashlights swerves to the more powerful, weve covered those, too. Just be careful out there.\n\n", "title": "- LED\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u5358\u306a\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u7167\u660e\u3078", "body": "LED\u306e\u767a\u5149\u6280\u8853\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3001\u51b7\u5374\u6a5f\u80fd\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- LED\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u5358\u306a\u308b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u7167\u660e\u3078", "- \u71b1\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1a\u5f37\u529b\u306aLED\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u306e\u51b7\u5374\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068DIY\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5cLED\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- 18650\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7167\u660e\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc", "- \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b66\u3073\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u7684\u306a\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9"]}

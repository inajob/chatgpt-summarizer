It did anything needed to support the plot or, in some cases, couldnt do things also in support of the plot. We know [SirGalaxy] was thinking about the tricorder when he named the Tinycorder, but the little device has a number of well-defined features. You can see a brief video of it working below the break.\nThe portable device has a tiny ESP32 and a battery. The 400240 display is handy, but has low power consumption. In addition to the sensors built into the ESP32, the Tinycorder has an AS7341 light sensor, an air quality sensor, and a weather sensor. An odd combination, but like its namesake, it can do lots of unrelated things.\n\nThe whole thing goes together in a two-part printed case. This is one of those projects where you might not want an exact copy, but you very well might use it as a base to build your own firmware. Even [SirGalaxy] has plans for future developments, such as adding a buzzer and a battery indicator.\nThis physically reminded us of those ubiquitous component testers. That another multi-purpose tester that started simple and gets more features through software.\n", "title": "- \u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cTinycorder\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "body": "Tinycorder\u306f\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3001\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3084\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306a\u62e1\u5f35\u8a08\u753b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cTinycorder\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f", "- ESP32\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fTinycorder\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- DIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eTinycorder", "- \u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u8ffd\u52a0\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308bTinycorder\u306e\u672a\u6765"]}

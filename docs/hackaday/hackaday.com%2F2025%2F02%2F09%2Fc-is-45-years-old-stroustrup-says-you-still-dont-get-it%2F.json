His premise is that C++ is robust and flexible and by following some key precepts, you can avoid problems.\nWe dont disagree, but C++ is much like its progenitor, C, in that it doesnt really force you to color inside the lines. We like that, though. But it does mean that people will go off and do things the way they want to do it, for any of a number of good and bad reasons.\n\nBjarne Stroustrup\nWe will admit it. We are probably some of the worst offenders. It often seems like we use C++ the way we learned it several decades ago and dont readily adopt new features like auto variables and overly fancy containers and templates.\nHe proposes guidelines, including the sensible Dont subscript pointers. Yet, we are pretty sure we will, eventually. Even if you are going to, also, it is still worth a read to see what you ought to be doing. We were hoping for more predictions in the section entitled The Future. Unfortunately  unlike Hackaday authors  he is much too smart to fall for that trap, so that section is pretty short. He does talk about some of the directions for the ISO standards committee, though.\nWe should have known about the 45 years, as we covered the 30th birthday. We like safer code, but we disagree with the idea that C++ is unsafe at any speed.\n\nPhotograph by [Victor Azvyalov] CC-BY-SA-2.0."}

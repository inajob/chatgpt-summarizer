On the back a blinking diode announces the arrival of each second. A temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) is employed for accurate time-keeping.\nThe clock can be folded in half, thereby doubling as a clapperboard for movie makers. The dimming system is analog, not pulse width modulation (PWM), which means no visible flashing artifacts when recording. It is highly configurable and has USB connectivity. And it has not one but two ARM microcontrollers, an ARM STM32L476, and an ARM STM32L010. If youre interested, you can pick one up for yourself from [Mitxela]s shop.\nToward the end of his video [Jeff] does some navel gazing, thinking about what might be required if future versions of the clock wanted to get down into precision at the nanosecond level. Do you arrange it so the light arrives at the viewers eyeball at the right time? Or do you update it on the clock at the right time and let the viewer know about it after a minuscule delay? Philosophical preponderances for another day!\nWe should add that weve seen plenty of cool stuff from [Mitxela] before, including the Euroknob and these soldering tweezers.\n\n", "title": "GPS\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09\u306eMitxela Precision Clock Mk IV\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Jeff Geerling\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044Mitxela\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6642\u8a08Mk IV\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002GPS\u3067\u6642\u523b\u30fb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u3001\u6620\u753b\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["GPS\u6a5f\u80fd\u642d\u8f09\u306eMitxela Precision Clock Mk IV\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u6620\u753b\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01\u6298\u308a\u305f\u305f\u307f\u5f0f\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u7279\u9577", "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u6642\u9593\u7ba1\u7406\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bTCXO\u6280\u8853", "ARM\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f32\u57fa\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "\u30ca\u30ce\u79d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff01\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

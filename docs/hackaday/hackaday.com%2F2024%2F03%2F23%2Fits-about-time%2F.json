After all, I live in Germany, Hackaday\u2019s server is in Los Angeles, and our writers are scattered all over the globe. I\u2019m always translating one time into another, and practice makes (nearly) perfect. But still, it got me.\nI was in the states visiting my parents, when Daylight Saving Time struck, but only in the USA. Now all my time conversions were off by an hour, and once I\u2019d worked through the way the sun travels around the globe, I thought I had it made. And then my cell phone started reporting a time that was neither CEST nor EDT, but a third time zone that was an hour off. Apparently some cell towers don\u2019t transmit time zone information, and my phone defaults to UTC. Who knew? For a short while, my phone lied to me, the microwave oven clock in the hotel lied to me, and I felt like I was going nuts.\nBut this all got me thinking about clocks and human time, and possibly the best advice I\u2019ve ever heard for handling it in your own programs. Always keep time in something sensible like UNIX time \u2013 seconds elapsed since an epoch \u2013 because you don\u2019t have to worry about anything more than adding one to a counter every second. When and if you need to convert to or from human times, you can write the function to do that simply enough, if you don\u2019t already have a library function to do so.\nWant to set an alarm for 2 hours from now? That\u2019s easy, because you only need to add 7,200 seconds, and you don\u2019t need to worry about 59 wrapping around to 0 or 23:59 to 0:00. Time math is easy in seconds. February 29th? That\u2019s just another 86,400 seconds. It\u2019s only us humans who make it complicated.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Go back to the 1990s, and coded cassette decks were a common way to stop thieves being able to use stolen stereos. Sadly, they became useless if you ever lost the code. [Simon] had found a deck in great condition that was locked out, so he set about building his own controller for it.\u00a0\nThe build relies on the cassette transport of a car stereo and a VFD display, but everything else was laced together by Simon. Its a play-only setup, with no record, seeing as its based on an automotive unit. [Simon]s write up explains how he reverse engineered the transport, figuring out how the motors and position sensors worked to control the playback of a cassette.\n[Simon] used an Atmega microcontroller as the brains of the operation, which reads the buttons of the original deck via an ADC pin to save I/O for other tasks. The chip also drives the VFD display for user feedback, and handles auto reverse too. The latter is thanks to the transports inbuilt light barriers, which detect the tapes current status. On the audio side, [Simon] whipped up his own head amplifier to process the signal from the tape head itself.\nFundamentally, its a basic build, but it does work. Weve seen other DIY tape decks before, too. Theres something about this format that simply refuses to die. The fans just wont let Compact Cassette go down without a fight. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u306e\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u89e3\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306f1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u76d7\u96e3\u9632\u6b62\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u4ed8\u304d\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001[Simon]\u306f\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3092\u89e3\u9664\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002Compact Cassette\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u306f\u5065\u5728\u3002", "titles": ["1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u306e\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u89e3\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "Atmega\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fDIY\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308bDIY\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u60c5\u71b1\u3068\u7d99\u7d9a", "\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7528\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u306e\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u4fe1\u53f7\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u72ec\u81ea\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305fDIY\u30ab\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad"]}

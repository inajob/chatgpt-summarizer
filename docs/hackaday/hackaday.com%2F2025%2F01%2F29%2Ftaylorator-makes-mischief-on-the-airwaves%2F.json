Called the Taylorator, as it was originally intended to carpet bomb the dial with the collected works of Taylor Swift on every channel, the code makes for some interesting reading if youre interested in the transmission-side of software defined radio (SDR).\nThe write-up talks about the logistics of FM modulation, and how quickly the computational demands stack up when youre trying to push out 100 different audio streams at once. It takes a desktop-class CPU to pull it off in real-time, and eats up nearly 4 GB of RAM.\nYou could use this project to play a different episode of the Hackaday Podcast on every FM channel at once, but we wouldnt recommend it. As [Stephen] touches on at the end of the post, this is almost certainly illegal no matter where you happen to live. That said, if you keep the power low enough so as not to broadcast anything beyond your home lab, its unlikely anyone will ever find out.\n\n", "title": "- LimeSDR mini\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fFM\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30e0\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "Stephen\u304cLimeSDR mini\u3067FM\u653e\u9001\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3002\u9055\u6cd5\u3060\u304c\u6280\u8853\u304c\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- LimeSDR mini\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fFM\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b9\u30d1\u30e0\u5b9f\u9a13", "- Taylorator\uff1aFM\u653e\u9001\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u5168\u4f53\u3092\u540c\u6642\u306b\u653b\u6483", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u4f1d\u9001\u6280\u8853\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u3067\u306e100\u97f3\u58f0\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u9001\u4fe1\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eFM\u653e\u9001\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3068\u30ea\u30b9\u30af"]}

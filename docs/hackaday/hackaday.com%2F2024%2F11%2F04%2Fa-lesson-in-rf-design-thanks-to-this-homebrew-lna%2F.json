Thats typically not a problem, as the market is littered with dozens of cheap options that can be delivered in a day or two  you just pay your money and get to work. But is there a case to be made for rolling your own LNA?\n[Salil, aka Nuclearrambo] thinks so, and he did a nice job showing us how its done. The first step, as always, is to define your specs, which for [Salil] were pretty modest: a low noise figure, moderate gain, and good linearity. He also wanted a bandpass filter for the 2-meter amateur radio band and for weather satellite downlinks, and a bias-tee to power the LNA over the coax feedline. The blog post has a detailed discussion of the electrical design, plus some good tips on PCB design for RF applications. We also found the discussion on bias-tee design helpful, especially for anyone who has ever struggled with the idea that RF and DC can get along together on a single piece of coax. Part 2 concentrates on testing the LNA, mostly using hobbyist-grade test gear like the NanoVNA and tiny SA spectrum analyzer. [Salil]s tests showed the LNA lived up to the design specs and more, making it more than ready to put to work with an RTL-SDR.\nWas this more work than buying an LNA? Absolutely, and probably with the same results. But then again, whats to learn by just getting a pre-built module in the mail?", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3001\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ed5\u69d8\u3084PCB\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u4f4e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u305d\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "RF\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306aLNA\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3059\u308b", "2\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u7528\u306e\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30d1\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u642d\u8f09LNA\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u5b9f\u8df5", "DIY LNA\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u8a55\u4fa1\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

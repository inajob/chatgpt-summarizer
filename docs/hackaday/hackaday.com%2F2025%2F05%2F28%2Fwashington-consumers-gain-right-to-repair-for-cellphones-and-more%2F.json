It requires manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation available for diagnostics and repair of digital electronics, including cellphones, computers and similar appliances. The relevant House Bill 1483 was signed into law last week after years of fighting to make it a reality.\nA similar bill in Oregon faced strong resistance from companies like Apple, despite backing\u00a0another Right to Repair bill in California. In the case of the Washington bill, there were positive noises from the side of Google and Microsoft, proclaiming themselves and their products to be in full compliance with such consumer laws.\nOf course, the devil is always in the details, with Apple in particular being a good example how to\u00a0technically comply with the letter of the law, while throwing up many (financial) roadblocks for anyone interested in obtaining said tools and components. Apples penchant part pairing is also a significant problem when it comes to repairing devices, even if these days its somewhat less annoying than it used to be  assuming youre running iOS 18 or better.\nThat said, we always applaud these shifts in the right direction, where devices can actually be maintained and repaired without too much fuss, rather than e.g. cellphones being just disposable items that get tossed out after two years or less.\nThanks to [Robert Piston] for the tip.", "title": "\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u5dde\u306e\u300c\u4fee\u7406\u6a29\u300d\u65b0\u6cd5\u30012026\u5e74\u306b\u65bd\u884c\u6c7a\u5b9a", "body": "\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u5dde\u30672026\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u6a29\u6cd5\u304c\u65bd\u884c\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u88fd\u9020\u696d\u8005\u306f\u90e8\u54c1\u3084\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3092\u7fa9\u52d9\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ef\u30b7\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u5dde\u306e\u300c\u4fee\u7406\u6a29\u300d\u65b0\u6cd5\u30012026\u5e74\u306b\u65bd\u884c\u6c7a\u5b9a", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u53cd\u767a\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u305f\u300c\u4fee\u7406\u6a29\u300d\u6cd5\u6848\u306e\u80cc\u666f", "Apple\u306e\u6280\u8853\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u8ab2\u984c", "\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u6587\u5316\u306e\u63a8\u9032"]}

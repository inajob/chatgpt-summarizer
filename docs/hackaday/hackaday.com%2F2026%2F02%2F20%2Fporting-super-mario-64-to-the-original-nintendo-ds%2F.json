Why youd want to do this is left as an exercise to the reader, but whether due to nostalgia or out of sheer spite, the question of how easy this would be remains. Correspondingly, [Tobi] figured that hed give it a shake, with interesting results.\nOf note is that someone else already ported SM64 to the DSi, which is a later version of the DS with more processing power, more RAM and other changes. The reason why the 16 MB of RAM of the DSi is required, is because it needs to load the entire game into RAM, rather than do on-demand reads from the cartridge. This is why the N64 made do with just 4 MB of RAM, which is as much RAM as the NDS has. Ergo it can be made to work.\nThe key here is NitroFS, which allows you to implement a similar kind of segmented loading as the N64 uses. Using this the [Hydr8gon] DSi port could be taken as the basis and crammed into NitroFS, enabling the game to mostly run smoothly on the original DS.\nThere are still some ongoing issues before the project will be released, mostly related to sound support and general stability. If you have a flash cartridge for the DS this means that soon you too should be able to play the original SM64 on real hardware as though its a quaint portable N64.\n\n", "title": "\u300cNintendo DS\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "body": "Nintendo DS\u3067\u306e\u300e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u300f\u79fb\u690d\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002\u97f3\u58f0\u554f\u984c\u3084\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u306b\u8ab2\u984c\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cNintendo DS\u3067\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fcDS\u306b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cNitroFS\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fNintendo DS\u7248\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u300d", "\u300cDSi\u7248\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30dd\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u300d", "\u300c\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa64\uff1a\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fcDS\u3067\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u8ab2\u984c\u300d"]}

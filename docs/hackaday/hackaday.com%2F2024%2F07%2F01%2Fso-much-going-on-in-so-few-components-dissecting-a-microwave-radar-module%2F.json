Theyd use clever circuits in which a transistor or other active part would fulfill multiple roles at once, and often such circuits would need more than a little know-how to get working. Its not often in 2024 that we encounter this style of circuit, but heres [Maurycy] with a cheap microwave radar module doing just that.\n\nOn the board is an RF portion with a single transistor, some striplines, and an SOIC chip. Oddly this last part turns out to be an infra-red proximity sensor chip, so whats going on? Careful analysis of the RF circuit reveals something clever. As expected, its a 3.18 GHz oscillator, but how is it functioning as both transmitter and receiver? The answer comes in the form of a resistor and capacitor in the emitter circuit, which causes the transistor to also oscillate at about 20 kHz. The result is that at different times in the 20 kHz period, the transistor is either off, fully oscillating at 3.18GHz and transmitting, or briefly in the not-quite-oscillating state between the two during which it functions as a super-regenerative receiver. This is enough for one device to effectively transmit and receive at the same time with the minimum of parts, theres no need for a mixer diode as you might expect if it were it a direct conversion receiver. Perhaps in RF terms, its not particularly pretty, but we have to admit to being impressed by its simplicity. He goes on to perform a few experiments with the board as a transmitter or as a more conventional radar.\nThis isnt the first such radar module weve looked at, heres one designed from scratch. And we love regens, since they are so simple to build.", "title": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u56de\u8def\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "\u96c6\u7a4d\u56de\u8def\u304c\u4e3b\u6d41\u306b\u306a\u308b\u4ee5\u524d\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u8005\u306f\u3001\u500b\u3005\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u304b\u3089\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u9577\u3051\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u8907\u6570\u306e\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3059\u5de7\u5999\u306a\u56de\u8def\u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u30012024\u5e74\u3067\u3082\u3053\u306e\u56de\u8def\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u304c\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u56de\u8def\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "1\u3064\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3067\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u56de\u8def", "\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\uff1a\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3068RF\u56de\u8def\u306e\u9023\u643a", "\u76f4\u611f\u7684\u306a\u5358\u7d14\u3055\uff1a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u982d\u8133\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u8a66\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u6ce2\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5fdc\u7528"]}

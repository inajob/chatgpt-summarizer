Just how bad itll be is perhaps a bit subjective, with pleas for relief likely to fall on deaf ears unless youve got firm documentation like that provided by this automated noise detection system.\nOK, lets face it  even with objective proof theres likely nothing that [Christopher Cooper] is going to do about the new crop of sirens going off in his neighborhood. Emergencies require a speedy response, after all, and sirens are perhaps just the price that we pay to live close to each other. That doesnt mean theres no reason to monitor the neighborhood noise, though, so [Christopher] got to work. The system uses an Arduino BLE Sense module to detect neighborhood noises and Edge Impulse to classify the sounds. An ESP32 does most of the heavy lifting, including running the UI on a nice little TFT touchscreen.\nWhen a siren-like sound is detected, the sensor records the event and tries to classify the type of siren  fire, police, or ambulance. You can also manually classify sounds the system fails to understand, and export a summary of events to an SD card. If your neighborhood noise problems tend more to barking dogs or early-morning leaf blowers, no problem  you can easily train different models.\nWhile we cant say that this will help keep the peace in his neighborhood, we really like the way this one came out. Weve seen the BLE Sense and Edge Impulse team up before, too, for everything from tuning a bike suspension to calming a nervous dog.\n"}

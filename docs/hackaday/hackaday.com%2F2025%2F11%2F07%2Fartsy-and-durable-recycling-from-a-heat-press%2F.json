[Brothers Make] are experienced in the world of plastic recycling and graced us with a look into a simple and reliable way to get consistent thin sheets of durable plastic. Using a common T-shirt press and a mixture of plastic scraps, you can get the process down quickly.\nSummarizing the process is pretty easy due to its simplicity. You take a T-shirt press, put some Teflon baking sheets on both sides of some plastic scraps, and then press. Repeating this a couple of times with different colored plastic will get you a nice looking sheet of usable sheets for any purpose you could dream of. Thicker pieces can have some life changing applications, or as simple as guitar picks, as shown by [Brothers Make].\nMake sure to try out this technique yourself if you have access to a press! Overuse of plastic is a widely known issue, and yet it feels like almost no one attempts to solve it. If you want a different kind of application, try making your own 3D printing filament out of recycled plastic!\n\n\nThanks to [George Graves] for the tip!", "title": "- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u624b\u6cd5", "body": "\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001T\u30b7\u30e3\u30c4\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u8584\u3044\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u306e\u624b\u6cd5", "- T\u30b7\u30e3\u30c4\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5ec3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u7528\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

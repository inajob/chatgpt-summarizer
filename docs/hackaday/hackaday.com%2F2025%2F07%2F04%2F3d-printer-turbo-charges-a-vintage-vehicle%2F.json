From spark plug adapters to exhaust pipes to dash panels, his CAD skills and additive manufacturing tech have played a number of roles in his process.\nMost recently, [Ryan] has embarked on a mission to equip an 80s-era Toyota KE70 Corolla with a turbo engine. The main question there being how to fit the engine back into the car once hes inserted a salvaged turbo into the exhaust line.\nThere is a non-trivial amount of stuff that needs to be packed in with the rest of the engine and finding a working configuration that doesnt get in the way of anything else requires some trial and error. Furthermore, the alignment of the many twisting and turning pieces of schedule 40 pipe that will direct gasses where they need to go needs to be pretty precise.\nJuggling all of this would be tedious, time consuming, and error prone if it were not for [Ryans] mighty 3D printer. He printed a set of the different elbows and reducers modeled on the schedule 40 pipe that he would likely be using. He added degree markers for easy reference later and flat sections at the ends of each piece so they could be bolted to each other. With this kit of parts in hand, he was able to mock up different arrangements, re-configuring them as he considered the position of other nearby components.\n\n\nThe project is still ongoing. but were looking forward to seeing [Ryan] roaring around in his souped-up Corolla soon. In the meantime you can go deeper on ways of adding turbo to vehicles from the 90s, the innovation of the Mercedes Formula 1 split turbo engine, and see the evolution of a 3D-printed pulsejet turbocharger.\nThanks to [Ryan Ralph] (not the same Ryan) for tipping us off.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8eca\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Ryan\u3055\u3093\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u30c8\u30e8\u30bfKE70\u306b\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u4e2d\u3002\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8eca\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30c8\u30e8\u30bfKE70\u306b\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "- \u7cbe\u5bc6\u306a\u6392\u6c17\u7ba1\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u8eca\u4e21\u3078\u306e\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u6280\u8853"]}

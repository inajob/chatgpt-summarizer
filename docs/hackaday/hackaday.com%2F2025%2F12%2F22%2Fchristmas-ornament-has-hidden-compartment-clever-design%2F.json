But theres a catch: the print is a challenging one. So make sure your printer is up to the task before you begin (or just mash PRINT and find out).\nWant a challenging print thats also useful? This two-piece ornament has a small gift area inside, and prints without supports.\nThis design is from [Angus] of [Makers Muse] and its not just eye-catching, but meticulously designed specifically for 3D printing. In fact, [Angus]s video (embedded under the page break) is a great round-up of thoughtful design for manufacture (DFM) issues when it comes to filament-based 3D printing.\nThe ornament prints without supports, which is interesting right off the bat because rounded surfaces (like fillets, or a spherical surface) facing the build plate  even when slightly truncated to provide a flat bottom  are basically very sharp overhangs. Thats a feature that doesnt generally end up with a good surface finish. [Angus] has a clever solution, and replaces a small section with a flat incline. One cant tell anything is off by looking at the end result, but it makes all the difference when printing.\nThere are all kinds of little insights into the specific challenges 3D printing brings, and [Angus] does a fantastic job of highlighting them as he explains his design and addresses the challenges he faced. One spot in particular is the flat area underneath the hang hole. This triangular area is an unsupported bridge, and because of its particular shape, it is trickier to print than normal bridges. The workable solution consists of countersinking a smaller triangle within, but [Angus] is interested in improving this area further and is eager to hear ideas on how to do so. We wonder if hes tried an approach we covered to get better bridges.\nWant to print your own? 3D files are available direct from [Angus]s site in a pay-what-you-like format. If your 3D printer is up to it, you should be able to make a few before Christmas. But if youd prefer to set your sights on next year with something that uses power and hardware, this tiny marble machine ornament should raise some eyebrows.\n\n"}

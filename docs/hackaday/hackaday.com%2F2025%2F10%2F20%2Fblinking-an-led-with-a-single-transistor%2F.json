You might grab an Arduino and run the Blink sketch, or you might lace up a few components to a 555. But you neednt go so fancy! [The Design Graveyard] explains how this same effect can be achieved with a single transistor.\nThe circuit in question is rather odd at first blush. The BC547 NPN transistor is hooked up between an LED and a resistor leading to a 12V DC line, with a capacitor across the emitter and collector. Meanwhile, the base is connected to nothing! Its just free-floating in the universe of its own accord. You might expect this circuit to do nothing at all, but if you power it up, the LED will actually start to flash.\nThe mechanism at play is relatively simple. The capacitor charges to 12 volts via the resistor. At this point, the transistor, which is effectively just acting as a poor diode in this case, undergoes avalanche breakdown at about 8.5 to 9 volts, and starts conducting. This causes the capacitor to discharge via the LED, until the voltage gets low enough that the transistor stops conducting once again. Then, the capacitor begins to charge back up, and the cycle begins again.\nIts a weird way to flash an LED, and its not really the normal way to use a transistor\u2014youre very much running it out of spec. Regardless, it does work for a time! Weve looked at similar circuits before too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Vik Olliver for the tip!]"}

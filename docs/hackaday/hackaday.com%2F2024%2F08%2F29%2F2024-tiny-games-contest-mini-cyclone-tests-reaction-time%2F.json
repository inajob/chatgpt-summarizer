Cyclone is almost too simple of a game, and thats probably part of why its so addictive.\nWant to make one for your desk? All it takes is an Arduino Nano R3 or comparable microcontroller, an RGB LED ring with 12 LEDs, a 162 LCD, a buzzer, and a momentary push button switch.\nInterestingly, there arent successive levels with increasing speed, but each round begins with a randomized speed value. Of course, this can all be easily changed in the code, which is modified from [Joern Weise]s original.\nThis is a tinier version of [mircemk]s original project, which uses a 60-LED ring and does contain levels. As usual with [mircemk]s builds, this project is mounted on their trademark 3 mm PVC board and covered with peel-and-stick wallpaper. Be sure to check out the demo and build video after the break.\nDont forget! You have until Tuesday, September 10th to enter the 2024 Tiny Games Contest, so get crackin!\n\n\n \n\n"}

But worry not, theres plenty more to tease the ear, with one of the nicest cyberdecks weve ever seen, and a bird that can store images in its song.\nStandout quick hacks are a synth that makes sounds from Ethernet packets, and the revelation that the original PlayStation is now old enough to need replacement motherboards. Finally we take a closer look at the huge effort that goes in to monitoring Americas high voltage power infrastructure, and some concerning privacy news from the UK.

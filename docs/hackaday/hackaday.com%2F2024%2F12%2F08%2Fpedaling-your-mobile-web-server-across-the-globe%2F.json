For example, just imagine hosting a website while pedaling across the world\u2014who would (not) want that? Meet [Jelle Reith], a tinkerer on an epic cycling adventure, whose bicycle doubles as a mobile web server. [Jelle]s project, jelle.bike, will from the 6th of December on showcase what hes seeing in real time, powered by ingenuity and his hub dynamo. If you read this far, youll probably guess: this hack is done by a Dutchman. You couldnt be more right.\nAt the heart of [Jelle]\u2019s setup is a Raspberry Pi 4 in a watertight enclosure. The tiny powerhouse runs off energy generated by a Forumslader V3, a clever AC-to-DC converter optimized for bike dynamos. The Pi gets internet access via [Jelle]\u2019s phone hotspot, but hosting a site over cellular networks isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. With no static IP available, [Jelle] routes web traffic through a VPS using an SSH tunnel. This crafty solution\u2014expanded upon by Jeff Geerling\u2014ensures seamless access to the site, even overcoming IPv6 quirks.\nThe system\u2019s efficiency and modularity exemplify maker spirit: harnessing everyday tools to achieve the extraordinary.

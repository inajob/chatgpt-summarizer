Perhaps the most famous in the last few decades is the International Space Station, but there are all kinds of others up there from amateur radio satellites, the Starlink constellation, satellite TV, and, of course, various spy satellites from a few of the worlds governments. [Felix] seems to have found one and his images of it can be found here.\n[Felix] has been taking pictures of the night sky for a while now, including many different satellites. While plenty of satellites publish their paths to enable use, spy satellites arent generally public record but are still able to be located nonetheless. He uses a large Dobsonian telescope to resolve the images of several different satellites speculated to be spy satellites, with at least one hosting a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. His images are good enough to deduce the size and shape of the antennas used, as well as the size of the solar panels on board.\nAs far as being concerned about the ramifications of imaging top-secret technology, [Felix] is not too concerned. He states that its likely that most rival governments would be able to observe these satellites with much more powerful telescopes that he has, so nothing he has published so far is likely to be a surprise to anyone. Besides, these arent exactly hidden away, either; theyre up in the sky for anyone to see. If you want to take a shot at that yourself you can get a Dobsonian-like telescope mostly from parts at Ikea, and use a bit of off-the-shelf electronics to point them at just the right position too.", "title": "\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u885b\u661f\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089", "body": "70\u5e74\u307b\u3069\u524d\u304b\u3089\u3001\u4f4e\u8ecc\u9053\u4e0a\u306b\u4eba\u5de5\u885b\u661f\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u3001\u5929\u4f53\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3067\u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\u6700\u3082\u6709\u540d\u306a\u306e\u306f\u56fd\u969b\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u4ed6\u306b\u3082\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u885b\u661f\u3084\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u885b\u661f\u306a\u3069\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308bFelix\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u5927\u578b\u306e\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u885b\u661f\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3084\u5f62\u72b6\u3092\u63a8\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u885b\u661f\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\uff1a\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089", "\u4f4e\u8ecc\u9053\u306b\u6d6e\u304b\u3076\u885b\u661f\u305f\u3061\uff1a\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c\u306e\u918d\u9190\u5473", "\u885b\u661f\u5199\u771f\u64ae\u5f71\u8005\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u885b\u661f\u306e\u89e3\u6790", "DIY\u885b\u661f\u89b3\u6e2c\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u3067\u5b87\u5b99\u3092\u89b3\u5bdf\u3059\u308b", "\u885b\u661f\u6280\u8853\u306e\u4e16\u754c\uff1aDIY\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c"]}

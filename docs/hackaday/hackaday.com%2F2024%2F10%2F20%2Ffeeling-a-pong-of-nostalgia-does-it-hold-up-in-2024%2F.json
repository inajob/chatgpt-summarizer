Yet how advisable is it to try and re-experience those nostalgic moments? Thats what [Matt] of the Techmoan YouTube channel decided to give a whirl when he ordered the Arcade1Up Pong 2 Player Countercade game system. This comes loaded with multiple variants of the Pong game, including Pong Doubles and Pong Sports, in addition to Warlords, Super Breakout and Tempest. This unit as the name suggests allows for head-to-head two-player gaming.\nThis kind of countercade system is of course much smaller than arcade versions, but you would expect it to give the Pong clones which [Matt] played as a youngster a run for their money at least. Ultimately [Matt]  after some multiplayer games with the Ms.  concluded that this particular nostalgia itch was one that didnt have to be scratched any more. While the small screen of this countercade system and clumsy interface didnt help much, maybe Pong just isnt the kind of game that has a place in 2024?\nFrom our own point of view of having played Pong (and many other old games) on a variety of old consoles at retro events  museums, it can still be a blast to play even just Pong against a random stranger at these places. Maybe the issue here is that nostalgia is more about the circumstances of the memory and less of the particular game or product in question. Much like playing Mario Kart 64 on that 20 CRT TV with three buddies versus an online match in a modern Mario Kart. Its just not the same vibe.\n\n"}

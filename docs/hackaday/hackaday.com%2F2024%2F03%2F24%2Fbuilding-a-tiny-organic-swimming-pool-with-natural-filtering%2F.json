Theyre usually maintained in this state with the regular addition of chlorine or other chemical. These kill biological stuff and help filter out dirt and other detritus. However,\u00a0 [David] likes to do things differently, as he demonstrates with a tiny plunge pool built inside his greenhouse.\nThe basic construction starts with digging a hole and building up a wall with concrete and bricks. Theres nothing particularly controversial there. Its roughly 2 meters by 3 meters by 0.8 meters deep. To help the pool maintain heat, theres a layer of foam insulation in the bottom, while the water is held inside a black liner.\nRather than traditional chemical methods, however, [David] relies on organic methods to maintain the pool. He explains how he uses an aquarium pump to create a bubble filtered pool that draws water through a gravel bed to maintain it and keep it clear. Its a very natural setup, with multiple plants in the water to make it as organic as can be.\u00a0Its the kind of thing youd expect to see at a luxury island resort, but [Davids] got one right in his very own greenhouse.\u00a0 [David] explains the organic filtering concept in greater detail on his website.\nWeve featured some pool hacks before, too, though more traditional ones than this. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Keith Olson for the tip!]", "title": "\u6e29\u5ba4\u5185\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "\u6e29\u5ba4\u5185\u306b\u5efa\u3066\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3002\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u6709\u6a5f\u7684\u306a\u30e1\u30bd\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u6c34\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u306b\u4fdd\u3064\u3002\u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u6d78\u6c34\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u85ac\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u6e29\u5ba4\u5185\u306b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u65ad\u71b1\u6750\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u6c34\u8349\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30ea\u30be\u30fc\u30c8\u6c17\u5206\u3092\u6e80\u55ab"]}

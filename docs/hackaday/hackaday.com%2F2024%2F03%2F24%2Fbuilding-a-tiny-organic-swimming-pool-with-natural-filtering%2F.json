Theyre usually maintained in this state with the regular addition of chlorine or other chemical. These kill biological stuff and help filter out dirt and other detritus. However,\u00a0 [David] likes to do things differently, as he demonstrates with a tiny plunge pool built inside his greenhouse.\nThe basic construction starts with digging a hole and building up a wall with concrete and bricks. Theres nothing particularly controversial there. Its roughly 2 meters by 3 meters by 0.8 meters deep. To help the pool maintain heat, theres a layer of foam insulation in the bottom, while the water is held inside a black liner.\nRather than traditional chemical methods, however, [David] relies on organic methods to maintain the pool. He explains how he uses an aquarium pump to create a bubble filtered pool that draws water through a gravel bed to maintain it and keep it clear. Its a very natural setup, with multiple plants in the water to make it as organic as can be.\u00a0Its the kind of thing youd expect to see at a luxury island resort, but [Davids] got one right in his very own greenhouse.\u00a0 [David] explains the organic filtering concept in greater detail on his website.\nWeve featured some pool hacks before, too, though more traditional ones than this. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Keith Olson for the tip!]"}

But theres always been a horsepower limit, a point beyond which a microcontroller is no longer enough, and a proper computer is needed. One of those barriers now appears to have been broken, as microcontroller-based emulation moves into the 32-bit era. [Amcchord] has the Basilisk II emulator ported to the ESP32-P4 platform, providing a 68040 Mac able to run OS8.1. This early-1990s-spec machine might not seem like much in 2026, but it represents a major step forward.\nThe hardware it uses is the M5Stack Tab5, and it provides an emulated Mac with up to 16 MB of memory. Remember, in 1992 this would have been a high-spec machine. It manages a 15 frames per second refresh rate, which is adequate for productivity applications. The emulator uses the Tab5s touchscreen to emulate the Mac mouse alongside support for USB input devices. To 1990 hackers, its almost the Mac tablet you didnt know you would want in the future.\nWe like this project, both because its advancing the art of emulation on microcontrollers, and also because it delivers a computer thats useful for some of the things you might have done with a Mac in 1992 and could even do today. Pulling this out on the train back then would have blown peoples minds. Theres even a chance that MacOS on something like this would turn a few heads in 2026. Its certainly not the first emulated Mac weve seen though."}

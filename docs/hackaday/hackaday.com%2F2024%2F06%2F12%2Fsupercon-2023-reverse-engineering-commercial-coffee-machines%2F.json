A modern machine by contrast has 21st century computing power, with touch screens, a full-fat operating system, and a touch screen interface. At Hackaday Supercon 2023, [Kuba Tyszko] shared his adventures in the world of coffee, after reverse engineering a couple of high-end dispensing machines. Sadly he doesnt reveal the manufacturer, but were sure readers will be able to fill in the gaps.\nUnder the hood is a PC running a Linux distro from a CF card. Surprisingly the distros in question were Slax and Lubuntu, and could quite easily be investigated. The coffee machine software was a Java app, which seems to us strangely appropriate, and it communicated to the coffee machine hardware via a serial port. Its a tale of relatively straightforward PC reverse engineering, during which he found that the machine isnt a coffee spy as its only communication with its mothership is an XML status report.\nIn a way what seems almost surprising is how relatively straightforward and ordinary this machine is. Were used to quirky embedded platforms with everything far more locked down than this. Meanwhile if hacking vending machines is your thing, you can find a few previous stories on the topic.\n\n", "title": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f32023\u3067\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u81ea\u52d5\u8ca9\u58f2\u6a5f\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3057\u3001PC\u3068Linux\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9006\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3002\u88fd\u9020\u5143\u306f\u660e\u304b\u3055\u305a\u3001Java\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u901a\u4fe1\u3002XML\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u89aa\u6a5f\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3002", "titles": ["\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f32023\u3067\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3044\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "PC\u3068Linux\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f21\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u901a\u4fe1\u3059\u308bJava\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u5206\u304b\u308b\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4e8b\u5b9f", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u8986\u3059\u6570\u3005\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u767a\u898b"]}

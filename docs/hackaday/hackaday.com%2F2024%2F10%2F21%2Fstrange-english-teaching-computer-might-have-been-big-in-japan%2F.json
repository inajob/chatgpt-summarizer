No? Didnt ring a bell for us either. The legend on the front boldly proclaims: CCI Multipurpose SLAP Computer, so maybe it is some kind of computer, but it is definitely strange. For one thing, the screen isnt a screen at all. [Rees] has found that it has something to do with teaching English. You can see the odd beast in the video below.\nWe dont know how common these were in Japan, but they appear to be virtually unknown everywhere else. Inside is a Z80 computer based on a\u00a0 Sanyo PHC-25, which is a little better known.\n\nThe strange screen is offset from the keyboard. There was also a tape drive and a ROM cartridge port. The screen, however, isnt driven by the computer  you still needed a TV. Instead, it is a window to view a paper graphic stored on a special kind of cartridge. The cartridge simply had images printed on paper. The computer could roll the paper to an image.\nInside, the computer is a fairly conventional Z80 design but with many extras, including a second Z-80. Luckily, the battery, which is known to leak, didnt completely blow out.\nWhen the video was made, the old box wasnt working. However, a comment on the video indicates that hes since got it working and found the software for it, so we are looking forward to a hands-on video soon.\nHave you seen one of these before? If you have, we are sure [Rees] would appreciate hearing from you. There seems to be a correlation between odd machines and dual Z-80s. We love seeing these old, forgotten machines.\n", "title": "1983\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u8b0e\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u88fd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf \"Cefucom-21\"\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "body": "[Ctrl-Alt-Rees]\u304c1983\u5e74\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u65e5\u672c\u306eCefucom-21\u306f\u3001\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u753b\u9762\u306f\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u306f\u753b\u9762\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u82f1\u8a9e\u6559\u80b2\u306b\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001Z80\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u542b\u3080\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["1983\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u8b0e\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u88fd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf \"Cefucom-21\"\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "Z80\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf \"Cefucom-21\"", "\u8b0e\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u88fdCefucom-21: \u4e8c\u53f0\u306eZ-80\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "1983\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u88fd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf \"Cefucom-21\"\u306e\u8b0e", "\u4e0d\u660e\u306a\u5916\u89b3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u65e5\u672c\u306eCefucom-21\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6"]}

[Ken Pillonel] has designed a set of streamlined, repairable, USB-C adapters for the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max that show Apple what innovation really means.\nIf youve followed [Pillonel]s work in the past, youll know hes as a big a fan of repairability as we are here, so this isnt just a cheap knockoff dongle thatll be in the trash as fast as your counterfeit wireless earbuds. In the video below, he walks us through his quest start-to-finish to design something compact that gives you all the joys of USB-C without the pain of buying a whole new set of headphones.\nWe like the iteration on the connector, showing that flexible circuits can do some amazing things, but are still subject to failure at extreme angles. Using a combination of 3D printing, a cool robot sandblasting machine, a pick-and-place, and some old fashioned hand soldering, [Pillonel] treats us to a polished final product thats put together with actual screws and not adhesive. His designs are all open source, so you can DIY, or he sells finished copies in his shop if you want to give one to your less-than-techy relatives.\n[Pillonel] may seem familiar as hes the guy who added USB-C to the iPhone before Apple and redesigned the AirPods Pro case for repairability. Apple is getting better about repair in some of its devices, for sure, but unsurprisingly, hackers do it better.\n\n", "title": "Apple\u88fd\u54c1\u306bUSB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306eLightning\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u5ec3\u6b62\u3092\u5f85\u3061\u308f\u3073\u308b\u4e00\u65b9\u3001\u88fd\u54c1\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3057\u3066\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u9769\u65b0\u3068\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3084\u3084\u7121\u7406\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Ken Pillonel\u306f\u3001AirPods\u3001AirPods Pro\u3001AirPods Max\u7528\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUSB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u306b\u672c\u5f53\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u306e\u610f\u5473\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Apple\u88fd\u54c1\u306bUSB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "AirPods\u5411\u3051USB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "USB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u56de\u8def\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3055\u308c\u305fAirPods\u7528USB-C\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "Apple\u306b\u5148\u99c6\u3051\u3066USB-C\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6539\u826f"]}

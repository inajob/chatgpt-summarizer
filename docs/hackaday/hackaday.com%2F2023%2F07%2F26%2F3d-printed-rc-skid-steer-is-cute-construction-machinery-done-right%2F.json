[ProfessorBoots] has long been a fan of the diminutive diggers, and decided to make a 3D-printed version for his own pleasure.\nThe build uses a chassis printed in several colors which adequately recreates the charms of a full-sized skid steer. The brains of the operation is an ESP32, which receives commands over WiFi for remote control. A pair of geared N20 brushed motors are driven from a small H-bridge controller, each one driving one side of the skid steer. A toothed belt was 3D printed to allow each motor to drive two wheels on one side. Meanwhile, a pair of servos are charged with both lifting and tilting the bucket. Yes, you heard correctly  you can actually pick up and carry objects around your desk with this thing.\nIts a neat build and could be your introduction into the world of RC construction machines. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\u30fc\u30c4\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u30673D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001WiFi\u3067\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011", "\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u53ef\u80fd\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011", "\u30bf\u30a4\u30e4\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u30593D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6b6f\u5f62\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011", "\u30d0\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011", "RC\u5efa\u8a2d\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3078\u306e\u5165\u308a\u53e3\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u3010\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3011"]}

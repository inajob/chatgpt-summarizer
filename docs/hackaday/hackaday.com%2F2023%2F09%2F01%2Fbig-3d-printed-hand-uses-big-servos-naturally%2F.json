As the first step towards that goal, hes built a giant printed hand big enough to hold a basketball.\nThe hand has fingers with several jointed segments, inspired by those wooden hand models sold as home decor at IKEA. The fingers are controlled via a toothed belt system, with two beefy 11 kg servos responsible for flexing each individual finger joint. A third 25 kg servo flexes the finger as a whole. [Ivan] does a good job of hiding the mechanics and wiring inside the structure of the hand itself, making an attractive robot appendage.\nAs with many such projects, control is where things get actually difficult. Its one thing to make a robot hand flex its fingers in and out, and another thing to make it move in a useful, coordinated fashion. Regardless, [Ivan] is able to have the hand grip various objects, in part due to the usefulness of the hands opposable thumb. Future plans involve adding positional feedback to improve the finesse of the control system.\nBuilding a good robot hand is no mean feat, and it remains one of the challenges behind building capable humanoid robots.

However, when that chair is attached to a commercial jet plane, theres a lot of technology that goes into making sure they are safe. According to a recent BBC article, testing involves crash dummies and robot arms.\nAdmittedly, these are first-class and business-class seats. Robots do repetitive mundane tasks like opening and closing the tray table many, many times. They also shoot the seats with crash dummies aboard at up to 16 Gs of acceleration. Just to put\u00a0 that into perspective, a jet pilot ejecting gets about the same amount of force. A MiG-35 pilot might experience 10 G.\nWe didnt realize how big the airline seat industry is in Northern Ireland. Thompson, the company that has the lab in question, is only one of the companies in the country that builds seats. Apparently, the industry suffered from the global travel slowdown during the pandemic but is now bouncing back.\nWhile people worry about robots taking jobs, we cant imagine anyone wanting to spend all day returning their tray table to the upright and locked position repeatedly. We certainly dont want to be 16 G crash dummies, either.\nCrash dummies have a long history, of course. Be glad airliners dont feature ejector seats."}

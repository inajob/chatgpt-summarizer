Yes, its a blessing to have terabyte SD cards smaller than your pinky nail and be able to access its data with mind-boggling speed. But theres a certain charm to a mass storage device that can potentially slice off your finger.\nWere overstating the dangers of the venerable paper tape reader, of course, a mass storage device that [David Hansel] recreated a few years back but we only just became aware of. That seems a bit strange since weve featured his Arduino-based Altair 8800 simulator, which is what this tape reader is connected to. Mechanically, the reader is pretty simple  just a wooden frame to hold the LEGO Technic wheels used as tape reels, and some rollers to guide the tape through a read head. That bit is custom-made and uses a pair of PCBs, one for LEDs and one for phototransistors. There are nine of each  eight data bits plus the index hole  and the boards are sandwiched together to guide the paper tape.\nThe main board has an ATmega328 which reads the parallel input from the read head and controls the tape motor. That part is important thanks to Altair Basics requirement for a 100- to 200-ms delay at the end of each typed line. The tape reader, which is just being used as sort of a keyboard wedge, can type a lot faster than that, so the motor speed is varied using PWM control as line length changes.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip."}

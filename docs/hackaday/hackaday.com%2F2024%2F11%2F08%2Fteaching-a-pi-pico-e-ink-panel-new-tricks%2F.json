[NerdCave] picked up a 4.2-inch E-ink panel but found its documentation a bit lacking when it came to using the display under MicroPython. Eventually he worked it out, and was kind enough to share with the rest of the class.\nThese paper-like displays draw little power and can hold static images. There were examples from the vendor of how to draw some simple objects and text, but [NerdCave] wanted to do graphics. There was C code to do it, but it wasnt clear how to port it to Python.\nThe key was to use the image2cpp website (weve used it before, but you can also use GIMP). Instead of C code, though, you get the raw bytes out and place them in your Python code. Once you know the workflow, it isnt that hard, and this is an inexpensive way to add a different kind of display to your projects. The same image conversion will help you work with other displays, too.\nWe arent sure what driver chip this particular display uses, but if you have one with the UC8151/IL0373, you can find some amazing MicroPython drivers for those chips.\n\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002MicroPython\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u6cd5\u3084\u753b\u50cf\u5909\u63db\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- MicroPython\u3067\u306eE-ink\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u305f\u3081\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u30da\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "- image2cpp\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u50cf\u5909\u63db\u306e\u624b\u9806", "- UC8151/IL0373\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eMicroPython\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

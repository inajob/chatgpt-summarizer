It looks brand new, though, and has three outputs and includes tracking for the adjustable positive and negative supply. After a quick demo of the units features, he tears it all down so we can see inside. You can catch the video below.\nSome similar supplies offer a 10-turn adjustment knob, but this one doesnt. Inside is a beefy transformer and quite a few through-hole components. There was room to change the main adjusted pot to a 10-turn unit, so he made the mod.\n\nTesting was mostly good, but there was some oscillation in certain situations. To tackle that, he worked through it with another unit in the second video below. The new unit had the same behavior. He probed around and found that one capacitor leaked electrolyte, which didnt fix the problem.\nAnalyzing the schematic was more productive. A feedback transistor had excessive gain at high frequency. This appears to be a design problem, and adding a resistor into the feedback loop makes it work as expected.\nIt is hard to go wrong with a name-brand power supply, but, as this shows, they are not always perfect. You can, of course, roll your own. You can make them very fancy if you like.\n\n", "title": "30\u5e74\u524d\u306eHP\u88fd\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u65b0\u54c1\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u898b\u3048\u307e\u3059\uff01\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff01", "body": "30\u5e74\u524d\u306eHP\u96fb\u6e90\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u58ca\u308c\u3066\u304a\u3089\u305a\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fa\u529b\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u53ef\u5909\u306e\u6b63\u8ca0\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306f\u91cd\u539a\u306a\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["30\u5e74\u524d\u306eHP\u88fd\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u65b0\u54c1\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u898b\u3048\u307e\u3059\uff01\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff01", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u8abf\u6574\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01", "\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3067\u767a\u751f\u3059\u308b\u632f\u52d5\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\uff01\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u3092\u3054\u89a7\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e0a\u306e\u554f\u984c\uff01\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u62b5\u6297\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u89e3\u6c7a\uff01", "\u540d\u524d\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u88fd\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u3082\u5b8c\u74a7\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3067\u3059\uff01"]}

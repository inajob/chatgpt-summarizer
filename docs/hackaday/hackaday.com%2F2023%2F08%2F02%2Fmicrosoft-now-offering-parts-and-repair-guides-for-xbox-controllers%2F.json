Yes, that even includes when its Microsoft.\nThis community has had a mixed relationship with the Redmond software giant, to say the least. But weve still got to give them credit when they do something positive. Not only are they offering a full selection of replacement parts for both the standard and Elite Xbox controllers, theyve also provided written instructions and step-by-step video guides on how to install your new parts.\nFor those of you who stopped playing console games when the controllers still only had two buttons, this might not seem like such a big deal. But considering a new Xbox Elite Wireless Controller will set you back a dizzying $180, its not hard to see why some folks would be excited about the possibility of swapping out the guts of the thing for $50.\nOf course, these parts were already available from third party sellers, and iFixit naturally has repair guides for all the different flavors of Xbox controllers. Nothing about what Microsoft is doing here makes the Xbox controller fundamentally any easier to repair than it was previously. But the fact that the company isnt treating their customers like adversaries is a step in the right direction.\nValve has been similarly open about the internals of the Steam Deck, though their presentation was a bit dramatic, and even Sony provided an official teardown video for the PS5. Were not sure why these companies are willing to pull back the curtain when it comes to gaming hardware. Whatever the reason, were certainly not complaining.\n\n", "title": "Xbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u304c\u516c\u5f0f\u306b\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff01", "body": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u304cXbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3068\u4ea4\u63db\u624b\u9806\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002$180\u3082\u3059\u308bXbox Elite Wireless Controller\u306e\u4e2d\u8eab\u3092$50\u3067\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u308b\u3002\u4ed6\u793e\u3082\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u4fee\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3093\u3067\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u696d\u754c\u3067\u306f\u826f\u3044\u65b9\u5411\u3078\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Xbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u304c\u516c\u5f0f\u306b\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff01", "Xbox\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u4ed8\u304d\uff01", "Xbox Elite\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\uff01", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u304c\u9867\u5ba2\u3092\u5927\u5207\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u8a3c\u62e0\uff01", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b\u3082\uff01"]}

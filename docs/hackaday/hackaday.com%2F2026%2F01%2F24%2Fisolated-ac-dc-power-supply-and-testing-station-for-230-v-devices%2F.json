If such excitement is not really your thing, you can opt for an isolation transformer and other types of safeties. In the case of [Micha\u0142 S\u0142omkowski], he opted to take a few steps further by modding a vintage East-German isolating variac with a broken amp meter into an isolated AC/DC power supply and testing station.\n\nThe core is formed by the isolated variable transformer, to which a configurable DC output section, a current limiter and digital voltage and current read-outs were added. This enables a variable AC output of 0  330 VAC and 0  450 VDC on their respective terminals, with the incandescent light bulb providing an optional current limiter.\nIn its final configuration [Micha\u0142] has been using the device for the past four years now for a range of tasks, including the simulating of various undesirable mains power conditions, varying the speed of an old Soviet-era drill, powering vacuum tube devices, capacitor reforming and of course running 100-120 VAC devices from e.g. the US.\nAs far as feature set goes, we have to admit that it is an impressive device, indeed. Although some parts of it are clearly playing it fast and loose with best practices, with [Micha\u0142] admitting to not being an electrician, it was clearly engineered well enough to survive a few years of use, something which cannot be said for even professional laboratory equipment these days.", "title": "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5909\u5727\u5668\u3092\u6539\u9020\uff01\u5b89\u5168\u306aAC/DC\u96fb\u6e90\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u5909\u5727\u5668\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001AC/DC\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u96fb\u5727\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5909\u5727\u5668\u3092\u6539\u9020\uff01\u5b89\u5168\u306aAC/DC\u96fb\u6e90\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u6f0f\u96fb\u3092\u9632\u3050\uff01\u30a2\u30a4\u30bd\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u53ef\u5909\u5909\u5727\u5668\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u6771\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u88fd\u5909\u5727\u5668\u3092\u518d\u751f\uff01\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306eAC/DC\u96fb\u6e90\u3067\u96fb\u52d5\u5de5\u5177\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u8a66\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u3092\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

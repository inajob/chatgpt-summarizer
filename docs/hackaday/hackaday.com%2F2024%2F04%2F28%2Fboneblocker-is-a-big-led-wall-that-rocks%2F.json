He built a giant LED wall and he did a damn fine job of it, too. Introducing BoneBlocker.\nBoneBlocker is an 8 x 14 wall of glass blocks that lives at a bar called Coin-Op. Each block was given a length of WS2812B LED strip. 30 LED/meter strips were chosen, as initial maths on the 60 LED/meter strips indicated the whole wall would end up drawing 1.5 kW. Discretion, and all that.\nThe glowing game controller.\nThe whole display is run from a WT32-ETH01 board, which is a fast ESP32-based module that has onboard Ethernet to boot. [Nick] used the WLED library as hed seen others doing great things with it, performance-wise. He ended up using one board per column to keep things fast, but he reckons this was also probably a little bit of overkill.\nHis article steps through the construction of the wall, the electronics, and the software required to get some games working on the display. The final result is quite something. Perhaps the best bit is his explanation of the custom controller he built for the game. Dig into it, you wont be disappointed.\nIn particular, we love how the glass blocks elevate this display to a higher aesthetic level. Weve seen other great projects tread this same route, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

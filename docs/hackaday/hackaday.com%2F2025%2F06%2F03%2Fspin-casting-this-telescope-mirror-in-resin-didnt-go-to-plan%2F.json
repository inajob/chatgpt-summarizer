However, [Unnecessary Automation] wanted to craft mirrors of his own for a custom telescope build. As it turns out, producing optically-useful mirrors is not exactly easy.\nFor the telescope build in question, [Unnecessary Automation] needed a concave mirror. Trying to get that sort of shape with glass can be difficult. However, theres such a thing as a liquid mirror where spinning fluid forms into a parabolic-like shape. Thus came the idea to spin liquid resin during curing to try and create a mirror with the right shape.\nThat didnt quite work, but it inspired a more advanced setup where a spinning bowl and dense glycerine fluid was used to craft a silicone mold with a convex shape. This could then be used to produce a resin-based mirror in a relatively stationary fashion. From there, it was just necessary to plate a shiny metal layer on to the final part to create the mirror effect. Unfortunately, the end result was too messy to use as a viable telescope mirror, but we learn a lot about what didnt work along the way.\nThe video is a great journey of trial and error. Sometimes, figuring out how to do something is the fun part of a project, even if you dont always succeed. If youve got ideas on how to successfully spin cast a quality mirror, drop them in the comments below. Weve seen others explore mirror making techniques before, too.\n\n"}

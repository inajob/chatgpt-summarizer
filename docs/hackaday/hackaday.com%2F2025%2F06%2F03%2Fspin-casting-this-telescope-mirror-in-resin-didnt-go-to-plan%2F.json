However, [Unnecessary Automation] wanted to craft mirrors of his own for a custom telescope build. As it turns out, producing optically-useful mirrors is not exactly easy.\nFor the telescope build in question, [Unnecessary Automation] needed a concave mirror. Trying to get that sort of shape with glass can be difficult. However, theres such a thing as a liquid mirror where spinning fluid forms into a parabolic-like shape. Thus came the idea to spin liquid resin during curing to try and create a mirror with the right shape.\nThat didnt quite work, but it inspired a more advanced setup where a spinning bowl and dense glycerine fluid was used to craft a silicone mold with a convex shape. This could then be used to produce a resin-based mirror in a relatively stationary fashion. From there, it was just necessary to plate a shiny metal layer on to the final part to create the mirror effect. Unfortunately, the end result was too messy to use as a viable telescope mirror, but we learn a lot about what didnt work along the way.\nThe video is a great journey of trial and error. Sometimes, figuring out how to do something is the fun part of a project, even if you dont always succeed. If youve got ideas on how to successfully spin cast a quality mirror, drop them in the comments below. Weve seen others explore mirror making techniques before, too.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53cd\u5c04\u93e1\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u6db2\u4f53\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1  ", "body": "\u93e1\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306f\u5931\u6557\u3059\u308b\u3082\u5b66\u3073\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u53cd\u5c04\u93e1\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u6db2\u4f53\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1  ", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3078\u306e\u9053\uff1a\u93e1\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4  ", "\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u93e1\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066  ", "\u5929\u4f53\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u7528\u306e\u93e1\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u5931\u6557\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9  ", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u6db2\u4f53\u6a39\u8102\u3067\u306e\u93e1\u4f5c\u308a\u6311\u6226\u8a18"]}

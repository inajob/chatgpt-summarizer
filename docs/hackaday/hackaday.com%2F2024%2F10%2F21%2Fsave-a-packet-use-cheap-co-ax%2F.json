But heres [Steve, KD2WTU] with a different take, hes suggesting that sometimes a not-so-good co-ax choice can make the grade. Hes passing up expensive 50 ohm cable in favour of the cheap and ubiquitous 75 ohm RG6 cable used in domestic TV and satellite receiver installations.\nFighting that received wisdom, he outlines the case for RG6. Its cheap and it has a surprisingly low loss figure compared to some more conventional choices, something that shouldnt be a surprise once we consider that its designed to carry GHz-plus signals. Where it loses is in having a lower maximum power rating. Power shouldnt be a problem to a shoestring ham for whom 100W is QRO. Another issue is that 75 ohm coax necessitates a tuner for 50 ohm transmitters. It also has the effect of changing the resonance of some antennas, meaning a few mods may be in order.\nSo were convinced, and with the relatively QRP shack here we cant see RG6 being a problem. Maybe its something to try in out next antenna experiment. Meanwhile if youre interested in some of the background on co-ax impedance choices, weve been there before.\n\n", "title": "RG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u9069\u5408\u3084\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001Steve(KD2WTU)\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a50\u03a9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u5b89\u304f\u3066\u6c4e\u7528\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b75\u03a9 RG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u63a8\u5968\u3002\u4f4e\u640d\u5931\u3067GHz\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u6271\u3048\u308b\u304c\u3001\u6700\u5927\u96fb\u529b\u306f\u4f4e\u3044\u305f\u308150\u03a9\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306b\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["RG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5", "RG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6b20\u70b9", "75\u03a9\u306eRG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u5b9f\u9a13", "50\u03a9\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b75\u03a9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u4f4e\u640d\u5931\u306eGHz\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1d\u9001\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308bRG6\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb"]}

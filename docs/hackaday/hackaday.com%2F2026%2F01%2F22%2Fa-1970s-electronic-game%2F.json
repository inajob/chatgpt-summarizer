Well, if it were a UK gaming company in 1978, the result would be a Waddingtons 2001 The Game Machine that you can see in the video from [Re:Enthused] below.\nThe deluxe console model had four complete games: a shooting gallery, blackjack, Code Hunter, and Grand Prix. But when you were done having fun, no worries. The machine was also a basic calculator with a very strange keyboard. We couldnt find an original retail price on these, but weve read it probably sold for \u00a320 to \u00a340, which, in 1978, was more than it sounds like today.\n\nLike a board game, there were paper score sheets. The main console had die-cut panels to decorate the very tiny screen (which looks like a very simple vacuum fluorescent display) and provide labels for the buttons. While it isnt very impressive today, it was quite the thing in 1978.\nThis would be a fun machine to clone and quite easy, given the current state of the art in most hacker labs. A 3D-printed case, color laser-printed overlays, and just about any processor you have lying around would make this a weekend project.\nIt is easy to forget how wowed people were by games like this when they were new. Then again, we dont remember any of those games having a calculator.\nAs a side note, Waddingtons was most famous for their special production of Monopoly games at the request of MI9 during World War II. The games contained silk maps, money, and other aids to help prisoners of war escape.\n"}

That question has been on our minds since the announcement that the latest 3D printer design from former open-source hardware stalwarts Prusa Research seems like it\u2019s not going to come with design files.\nIronically, the new Core One is exactly the printer that enthusiasts have been begging Prusa to make for the last five years or more. Since seeing hacker printers like the Voron and even crazy machines like The 100 whip out prints at incredible speed, the decade-old fundamental design of Prusa\u2019s i3 series looks like a slow and dated, if reliable, workhorse. \u201cBed slinger\u201d has become a bit of a pejorative for this printer architecture in some parts of the 3DP community. So it\u2019s sweet to see Prusa come out with the printer that everyone wants them to make, only it comes with the bitter pill of their first truly closed-source design.\nIs the act of not sharing the design files going to save them? Is it even going to matter? We would argue that it\u2019s entirely irrelevant. We don\u2019t have a Core One in our hands, but we can\u2019t imagine that there is anything super secret going on inside that couldn\u2019t be reverse engineered by any other 3DP company within a week or so. If anything, they\u2019re playing catch up with other similar designs. So why not play to one of their greatest strengths \u2013 the engaged crowd of hackers who would most benefit from having the design files?\nOf course, Prusa\u2019s decision to not release the design files doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re turning their backs on the community. They are also going to offer an upgrade package to turn your current i3 MK4 printer into the new Core One, which is about as hacker-friendly a move as is possible. They still offer kit versions of the printers at a discount, and they continue to support their open-source slicer software.\nBut this one aspect, the move away from radical openness, still strikes us as bittersweet. We don\u2019t have access to their books, of course, but we can\u2019t imagine that not providing the design files gains them much, and it will certainly damage them a little in the eyes of their most devoted fans. We hope the Core One does well, but we also hope that people don\u2019t draw the wrong lesson from this \u2013 that it does well because it went closed source. If we could run the experiment both ways, we\u2019d put our money on it doing even better if they released the design files.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

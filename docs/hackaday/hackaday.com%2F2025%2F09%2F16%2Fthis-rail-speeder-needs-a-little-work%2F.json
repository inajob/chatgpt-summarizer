[AT Lab] did, and the resulting build makes for a very watchable video.\nSome of us have been known to spend a little too much time chasing trains, and theres little on rails that wont catch a railfans eye. That goes for rail speeders too, home constructed railcarts for exploring abandoned lines, and there are some great builds out there. We like the one in the video below the break, but we cant help noticing a flaw which might just curtail its career.\nIts a simple enough build, a wooden chassis, a single motor and chain drive to one axle. All the wheel fittings are 3D printed, which might be a case of using the one tool you have to do everything, but seems to work. It rides well on the test track which appears to be an abandoned industrial siding, but its in those wheels we can see the problem and we guess that perhaps the builder is not familiar with rails. The Punto wheels have an inner rim and an outer rim, while a true rail wheel only has an inner one. Theres a good reason for this; real railways have points and other trackwork, not to mention recessed rails at road crossings or the like. We love the cart, but wed cut those inner rims off to avoid painful derailments.\nIf youre up for the ultimate railway build, take care not to go near a live line, and make sure you follow this video series.\n\n", "title": "- FIAT Punto\u306e\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "FIAT Punto\u306e\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3002\u5185\u5074\u306e\u30ea\u30e0\u304c\u554f\u984c\u3067\u8131\u7dda\u306e\u6050\u308c\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- FIAT Punto\u306e\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u9244\u9053\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u8d70\u884c\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3068\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u9632\u3050\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

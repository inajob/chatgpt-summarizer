Indeed, if your machining tends towards the miniature, consider building yourself a series of tiny machines like [KendinYap] did. In the video below, you can see the miniature electric sander, table saw, drill press, and cut-off saw put through their paces.\nJust because the machines are small, doesnt mean theyre not useful. In fact, theyre kind of great for doing smaller jobs without destroying what youre working on. The tiny belt sander in particular appeals in this case, but the same applies to the drill press as well. [KendinYap] also shows off a tiny table and circular saw. The machines are straightforward in their design, relying largely on 3D printed components. Theyre all powered by basic DC brushed motors which are enough to get the job done on the small scale.\nThey look particularly good if tiny scale model-making is your passion.\n\n"}

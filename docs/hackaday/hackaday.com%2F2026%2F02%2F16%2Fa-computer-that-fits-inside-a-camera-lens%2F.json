They brought large sensors, interchangeable lenses, and professional-level viewfinders to the digital world at approachable prices, and then cemented their lead when they started being used to create video as well. Theyre experiencing a bit of a decline now, though, as mirrorless cameras start to dominate, and with that comes some unique opportunities. To attach a lens meant for a DSLR to a mirrorless camera, an adapter housing must be used, and [Ancient] found a way to squeeze a computer and a programmable aperture into this tiny space.\nThe programmable aperture is based on an LCD screen from an old cell phone. LCD screens are generally transparent until their pixels are switched, and in most uses as displays a backer is put in place so someone can make out what is on the screen. [Ancient] is removing this backer, though, allowing the LCD to be completely transparent when switched off. The screen is placed inside this lens adapter housing in the middle of a PCB where a small computer is also placed. The computer controls the LCD via a set of buttons on the outside of the housing, allowing the photographer to use this screen as a programmable aperture.\nThe LCD-as-aperture has a number of interesting uses that would be impossible with a standard iris aperture. Not only can it function as a standard iris aperture, but it can do things like cycle through different areas of the image in sequence, open up arbitrary parts or close off others, and a number of other unique options. Its worth checking out the video below, as [Ancient] demonstrates many of these effects towards the end. Weve seen some of these effects before, although those were in lenses that were mechanically controlled instead.\n\n\nThanks to [kemfic] for the tip!", "title": "\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u7528\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7d5e\u308a\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "DSLR\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304b\u3089\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u884c\u304c\u9032\u3080\u4e2d\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7d5e\u308a\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u7528\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7d5e\u308a\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u53e4\u3044\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u306eLCD\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "DSLR\u304b\u3089\u30df\u30e9\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9\u3078\uff1a\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7d5e\u308a\u3067\u5199\u771f\u8868\u73fe\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b", "\u5149\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1aLCD\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u6a5f\u80fd"]}

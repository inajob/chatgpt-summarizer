We should have weird glowy lights everywhere, all over our homes, cars, and businesses. In the automotive world, luxury automakers are doing their part with LED ambient lighting systems, but the rest of us have to step up. [Super Valid Designs] has developed an excellent modular DMX lighting rig thats fit for this purpose; the rest of us just have to get to work and build our own!\u00a0 (Video, embedded below.)\nThe design relies on hot-swapping powered bases that let a variety of different lights to be swapped in as needed. They use a custom four-pin socket designed by [Super Valid Designs] using PVC and ABS plumbing and conduit parts and tent pole springs from Home Depot. Theres a 3D-printable version, too, which is useful for those around the world that cant get access to American standard gear easily. Anyone from the Nerf scene will understand this frustration well.\nThe real cool part of the modular rig, though, are the tube fixtures. Theres a ball design too, but they dont look quite as future-cool as the tubes. They use fluorescent tube protectors as a cheap source of clear tubes, and use plumbing and conduit parts to make easy-insert connectors for pairing with the modular bases. Light is courtesy of old-school non-addressable RGB LED strips, attached to flat aluminium trim with their own adhesive combined with a wrap of clear packing tape as well. The LED strip is attached to one side of the tube, with parchment paper layered inside the tubes to act as a diffuser.\nBuilding in quantities of 8 or more, [Super Valid Designs] reckons that the tubes can be built for $50 each or less. Of course, that adds up to a few hundred dollars in total, but the results speak for themselves.\nIf youre thinking of tackling this project, but DMX is beyond your current skillset, fear not. Weve got just the primer to get you started! Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u3084\u8eca\u306a\u3069\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306b\u5149\u308b\u7167\u660e\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u5c06\u6765\u306b\u306f\u3001\u5bb6\u3084\u8eca\u3001\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u306e\u3042\u3061\u3053\u3061\u306b\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u5149\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002 [Super Valid Designs]\u306f\u3001\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u306aDMX\u7167\u660e\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u3082\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u307f\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\uff01 \u7167\u660e\u306f\u65e7\u5f0f\u306e\u975e\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u53ef\u80fd\u306aRGB LED\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5efa\u7bc9\u8cbb\u7528\u306f\u7d0450\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u3084\u8eca\u306a\u3069\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306b\u5149\u308b\u7167\u660e\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306eDMX\u7167\u660e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300d", "\u300c\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u57fa\u6e96\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308a\u306b\u304f\u3044\u4eba\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff13D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u300d", "\u300c\u30a8\u30b3\u30ce\u30df\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u7167\u660e\u300d", "\u300c\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3082\u59cb\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308bDMX\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u5165\u9580\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u300d"]}

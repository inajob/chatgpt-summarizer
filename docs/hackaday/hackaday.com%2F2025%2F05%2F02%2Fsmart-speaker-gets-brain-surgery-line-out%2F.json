Your choices become: hack together a DIY replacement, or hack the commercial product to do what you need. [Daniel] chose door number two when he realized his Yamaha MusicCast smart speaker was perfect for his particular use case, except for its tragic lack of line out. A little surgery and a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) breakout board solved that problem.\nYou cant hear it in this image, but the headphones work.\n[Daniel] first went diving into the datasheet of the Yamaha amplifier chip inside of the speaker, before realizing it did too much DSP for his taste. He did learn that the chip was getting i2s signals from the speakers wifi module. Thats a lucky break, since i2s is an open, well-known protocol. [Daniel] had an Adafruit DAC; he only needed to get the i2s signals from the smart speakers board to his breakout. That proved to be an adventure, but well let [Daniel] tell the tale on his blog.\nAfter a quick bit of OpenSCAD and 3D printing, the DAC was firmly mounted in its new home. Now [Daniel] has the exact audio-streaming-solution he wanted: Yamahas MusicCast, with line out to his own hi-fi.\n[Daniel] and hackaday go way back: we featured his robot lawnmower in 2013. Its great to see hes still hacking. If youd rather see whats behind door number one, this roll-your-own smart speaker may whet your appetite.", "title": "- Yamaha\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u7406\u60f3\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "Yamaha\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001DAC\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u306e\u97f3\u8cea\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- Yamaha\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u7406\u60f3\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "- DIY DAC\u3067\u97f3\u8cea\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u305f\u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- i2s\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fDAC\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306e\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u5fdc\u3048\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u4f8b"]}

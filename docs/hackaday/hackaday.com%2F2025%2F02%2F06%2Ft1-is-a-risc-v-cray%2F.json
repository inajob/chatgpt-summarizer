Enter T1 (short for Torrent-1), a RISC-V vector inspired by the Cray X1 vector machine.\nT1 has support for features, including lanes and chaining. The chip contains a version of the Rocket Core for scalar operations, but theres no official support for using it. The project claims you could easily replace that core with any other RISC-V CPU IP.\n\nBy focusing on parallelism instead of out of order execution, the design gets to skip branch prediction, register renaming, and similar problems.\nThere is an emulator if you want to experiment. You can even grab a docker image for easy installation. This doesnt look like something you could pick up in an hour, so prepare to spend some time. Everything is bare-metal, too, so leave your favorite development tools at home.\nThe project uses Chisel, which weve covered before. The build system seems very complex, but based on Nix Flakes, so it should be understandable.\nIf your high-performance RISC-V dreams are more conventional, theres work going on in that area, too.\nTitle graphic from Freepik.", "title": "RISC-V\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u300cT1\u300d\uff1a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4e26\u5217\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "T1\u306fRISC-V\u30d9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u4e26\u5217\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["RISC-V\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u300cT1\u300d\uff1a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4e26\u5217\u51e6\u7406\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8T1\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u5e73\u884c\u6027\u91cd\u8996\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "\u300cT1\u300d\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3059\u308b\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30c1\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "RISC-V\u3068\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f"]}

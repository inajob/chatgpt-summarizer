Even if this is a somewhat questionable take, theres something to be said for the interactive display over at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco which has you try to escape the tyranny of machine-vision and get recognized as a crab, traffic cone, or something else thats not pedestrian-shaped.\nDaniel Coppen, one of the artists behind \u201cHow (not) to get hit by a self-driving car,\u201d sets up a cone at the exhibit at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco on March 22, 2024. (Credit: Stephen Council, SFGate)\nThe display ran from March 21st to March 23rd, with [Stephen Council] of SFGate having a swing at the challenge. As can be seen in the above image, he managed to get labelled as fire during one attempt while hiding behind a stop sign as he walked the crossing. Other methods include crawling and (ab)using a traffic cone.\nCreated by [Tomo Kihara] and [Daniel Coppen], its intended to be a playful, engaging game installation. Both creators make it clear that self-driving vehicles which use LIDAR and other advanced detection methods are much harder to fool, but given how many Teslas are on the road using camera-based systems, its still worth demonstrating the shortcomings of the technology.\nTheres no shortage of debate about whether or not autonomous vehicles are ready to share the roads with human drivers, especially when they exhibit unusual behavior. Weve already seen protesters attempt to confuse self-driving systems with methods that arent far removed from what [Kihara] and [Coppen] have demonstrated here, and it seems likely such antics will only become more common with time.", "title": "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u3060\u307e\u3059\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u7f8e\u8853\u9928\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308b", "body": "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u304c\u3069\u308c\u3060\u3051\u5371\u967a\u304b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8b70\u8ad6\u3067\u3001\u6b69\u884c\u8005\u3092\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u305b\u305a\u9003\u308c\u3066\u8eca\u306b\u8f62\u304b\u308c\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u7f8e\u8853\u9928\u3067\u5c55\u793a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u306f\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u306e\u5f31\u70b9\u3092\u793a\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u3060\u307e\u3059\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u7f8e\u8853\u9928\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308b", "\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u5c55\u793a\u4f1a\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u6297\u7b56\u3092\u6a21\u7d22", "\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u7f8e\u8853\u9928\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5c55\u793a", "\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8", "\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u54c1\u5c55\u793a\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080"]}

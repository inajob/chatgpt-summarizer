Just how much of a compromise are these (usually rebranded) PSUs, and should you trust them with your electronics? Recently [Denki Otaku] purchased a cheap unit off Amazon Japan for a closer look, and found it to be rather lacking.\nInternals of the cheap bench PSU reviewed by Denki Otaku on YouTube.\nMajor compromises include the lack of an output power switch, no way to check the set current limit without shorting the output, very slow drop in output voltage while adjusting due to the lack of a discharge circuit, and other usability concerns. Thats when the electrical performance of the PSU got tested.\nRight off the bat a major issue in this cheap switching mode PSU is clear, as it has 200 mV peak-to-peak noise on its output, meaning very little output filtering. The maximum power output rating was also far too optimistic, with a large voltage drop observed. Despite this, it generally worked well, and the internals  with a big aluminium plate as heatsink  look pretty clean with an interesting architecture.\nThe general advice is to get a bench PSU that has features like an output power button and an easy way to set the voltage and current limits. Also do not connect it to anything that cares about noise and ripple unless you know that it produces clean, filtered output voltages.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\uff1a\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "body": "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u52a3\u308a\u3001\u7279\u306b\u51fa\u529b\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u304c\u5927\u304d\u3044\u3002\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\uff1a\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u305f\u683c\u5b89PSU\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "- \u4f7f\u3044\u306b\u304f\u3055\u6e80\u8f09\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u7279\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u51fa\u529b\u96fb\u5727\u306e\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aPSU\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9", "- \u6700\u9069\u306a\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u96fb\u6e90\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\uff1a\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9"]}

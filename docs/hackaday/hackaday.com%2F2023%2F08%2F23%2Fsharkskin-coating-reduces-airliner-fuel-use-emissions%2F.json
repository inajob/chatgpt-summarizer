The former is due to the never-ending quest for profit, while the latter helps airlines maintain their social license to operate. Less cynically, more efficient technologies are better for the environment, too.\nOne of the latest innovations in this space is a new sharkskin-like film applied to airliners to help cut drag. Inspired by nature itself, its a surface treatment technology that mimics the unique characteristics of sharkskin to enhance aircraft efficiency. Even better, its already in commercial service!\nFrom The Ocean To The Sky\nThe riblets, as seen on the scales, or denticles, of a sharks skin.

What it has figured out over millions of years can teach us a lot today. In this regard, the shark has skin unlike any other marine creature. Evolution has bestowed upon it a somewhat rough and ribbed skin. This complex natural structure is credited with reducing drag as the shark navigates through water.\nTwo major components of sharkskin play into this role. The first is a complex interaction with the passive way the sharks scales respond to water flows.\u00a0 The second is the riblet features on the scales of the sharks skin. This feature has been explored as a potential drag-saving tool for everything from swimsuits to cars. Riblets are essentially like small keels on the skin, which are aligned with the flow direction of the water flowing over the sharks body.\nTypically, youd expect the extra wetted surface area created by the riblets to increase drag, but they do quite the opposite. The mechanisms are still not fully understood, but research has revealed some of the secrets involved. Under typical turbulent flow during swimming, vortices form above the riblet surface, only interacting with the tips of them. This leaves a lower-velocity channel in the valleys between the riblets, reducing sheer stresses in the fluid in this area over the majority of the riblet surface. As a whole, vortex translation across the skin surface is also reduced by the riblet structures.\u00a0 This reduces turbulence overall by virtue of reducing vortexes bursting, tangling, and otherwise negatively interacting with each other.\nCommercialization\nLufthansa expects to make major savings by using the AeroSHARK film.

The result of that work is AeroSHARK, an adhesive riblet film designed to reduce fuel consumption, and in turn, emissions from aircraft.\nThis innovative film, though subtle in appearance, is poised to make a significant difference in the aviation world. The surface of AeroSHARK boasts millions of prism-shaped riblets, each no more than 50 micrometers high, or approximately 2/1000ths of an inch. When applied to an aircraft, this film emulates the drag-reducing properties of sharkskin.\nIts potential benefits are substantial. Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), having recognized the promising nature of this technology, calculated that by applying 950 square meters of this film to a Boeing 777-300ER in specific patterns aligned with the airflow, fuel consumption could be reduced by 1.1 percent. SWISS will apply the film to its full fleet of twelve Boeing 777-300ERs, and expects a total annual reduction of 4,800 tons of jet fuel and a corresponding decrease of approximately 15,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.\nWorkers applying the film to a Lufthansa aircraft.

This move is estimated to save 3,700 tons of jet fuel and prevent 11,700 tons of CO2 emissions annually. Its believed the film could be slightly more effective on cargo aircraft, which dont have rows of passenger windows to work around.\nObviously, to go into commercial service, the AeroSHARK film has to be able to withstand the rigors of the flight environment. The film is reportedly resilient against weather extremes, UV radiation, and the considerable temperature and pressure fluctuations encountered during long-haul flights. Moreover, when applied to wing surfaces, the flow modification can even aid in generating extra lift, further increasing an aircrafts performance.\nFuture work to refine the technology is ongoing, particularly with regards to expanding its application to other aircraft types. Initial calculations suggest that with further development, AeroSHARK could cut CO2 emissions by up to three percent.\nThe key will be whether or not the material will hold up over time and maintain its performance in real world use, where grit and grime could threaten its performance potential.\u00a0 If the material does work in practice, and doesnt create undue maintenance hassles, expect it to quickly become popular with airlines across the globe. The idea of a 1 percent saving in fuel costs for the upfront price of some sticky film is one that no airline could ignore."}

Imagine a film cartridge with attacked sensor, the idea went, which you could just drop into your trusty SLR and continue shooting digital. As it happened they never materialised and most film SLRs were consigned to the shelf. So here in 2023 its a surprise to find an outfit called Im Back Film promising something very like a 35mm cartridge with an attached sensor.\nThe engineering challenges are non-trivial, not least that theres no standard for distance between reel and exposure window, and theres next-to-no space at the focal plane in a camera designed for film. Theyve solved it with a 20 megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor which gives a somewhat cropped image, and what appears to be a ribbon cable that slips between the camera back and the body to a box which screws to the bottom of the camera. Its not entirely clear how they solve the real-to-window distance problem, but were guessing the sensor can slide from side to side somehow.\nIts an impressive project and those of us who shot film back in the day cant resist a bit of nostalgia for our old rigs, but we hope it hasnt arrived too late. Digital SLRs are ubiquitous enough that anyone who wants one can have one, and meanwhile the revival in film use has given many photographers a fresh excuse to use their old camera the way it was originally intended. Well soon see whether it catches on though  the crowdsourcing campaign for the project will be starting in a few days.\nOddly this isnt the first such project weve seen, though it is the first with a usable-size sensor."}

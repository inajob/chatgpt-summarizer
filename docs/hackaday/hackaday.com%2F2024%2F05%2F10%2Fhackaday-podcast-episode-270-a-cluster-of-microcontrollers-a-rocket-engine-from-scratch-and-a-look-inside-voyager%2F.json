Theres cheap microcontrollers in highly parallel applications, a library that can easily unlock the world of Bluetooth input devices in your next project, some gorgeous custom flight simulator buttons that would class up any front panel, and an incredible behind the scenes look at how a New Space company designs a rocket engine from the ground up.\nStick around to hear about the latest 3D printed gadget that all the cool kids are fidgeting around with, a brain-computer interface development board for the Arduino, and a WWII-era lesson on how NOT to use hand tools. Finally, learn how veteran Hackaday writer Dan Maloney might have inadvertently kicked off a community effort to digitize rare documentation for NASAs Voyager spacecraft.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload your very own copy of the podcast right about here.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 270 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nThe 2024 Business Card Challenge Starts Now\n\nThe Credit Card Sized GameBoy\nA Linux Business Card You Can Build\nTiny Sideways Tetris On A Business Card\n\n\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Karo] for guessing Flappy Bird!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\n256-Core RISC-V Megacluster\n\nA RISC-V Supercluster For Very Low Cost\n\n\nHow Does The Raspberry Pi Rack Up Against A Mini PC?\nBluepad32 Brings All The Controllers To Your MCU\nPut More Korry In Your Flight Sim Switches\nRobotic Platform Turns Shop Vac Into Roomba\n\nA Wiper Motor 101\n\n\nBuilding A Rocket Engine From Scratch\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\n3D Printed Fidget Knife Snaps Back And Forth All Day Long\nMuch Faster Cold Brew Through Cavitation\nYour Pi, From Anywhere\nZ80s From The \u201980s Had Futuristic Design\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nGiving Your KiCad PCB Repository Pretty Pictures\nArdEEG Lowers The Cost Of Brain-Computer Interfaces\nFully 3D Printed Case Is Stacked High With Mini PCs\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nRetrotechtacular: How Not To Use Hand Tools\nThe Computers Of Voyager\n", "title": "2024 Business Card Challenge: \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "2024\u5e74\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u308a\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u30a8\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306a\u8b70\u8ad6\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u898b\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3057\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u3084\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u53d6\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["2024 Business Card Challenge: \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "Bluetooth\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea", "\u5b8c\u5168\u306b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831", "Arduino\u7528\u306e\u8133-\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "Voyager\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u6587\u66f8\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316"]}

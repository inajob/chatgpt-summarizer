However, maybe we should call it Vail code after Alfred Vail, who may be its real inventor. Havent heard of him? You arent alone. Yet he was behind the first telegraph key and improved other parts of the fledgling telegraph system.\nThe story starts in 1837 when Vail visited his old school, New York University, and attended one of Morses early telegraph experiments. His family owned Speedwell Ironworks, and he was an experienced machinist. Sensing an opportunity, he arranged with Morse to take a 25% interest in the technology, and in return, Vail would produce the necessary devices at the Ironworks. Vail split his interest with his brother George.\nBy 1838, a two-mile cable carried a signal from the Speedwell Ironworks. Morse and Vail demonstrated the system to President Van Buren and members of Congress. In 1844, Congress awarded Morse $30,000 to build a line from Washington to Baltimore. That was the same year Morse sent the famous message What Hath God Wrought? Who received and responded to that message? Alfred Vail.\nThe Original Telegraph\nTelegraphs were first proposed in the late 1700s, using 26 wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. Later improvements by Wheatstone and Cooke reduced the number of wires to five, but that still wasnt very practical.\nSamuel Morse, an artist by trade, was convinced he could reduce the number of wires to one. By 1832, he had a crude prototype using a homemade battery and a relatively weak Sturgeon electromagnet.\n\nMorses original plan for code was based on how semaphore systems worked. Messages would appear in a dictionary, and each message would be assigned a number. The telegraph produced an inked line on a paper strip like a ticker tape. By counting the dips in the line, you could reconstruct the digits and then look up the message in the dictionary.\nMorses partners, Vail and a professor named Gale, didnt get their names on the patents, and for the most part, the partners didnt take any credit  Vails contract with Morse did specify that Vails work would benefit Morse. However, there is evidence that Vail came up with the dot/dash system and did much of the work of converting the hodgepodge prototype into a reliable and manufacturable system.\nImprovements\nVails sending key is instantly recognizable (photo from Smithsonian Institute) 3D View\nFor example, Morses telegraph used a pencil to mark paper, while Vail used a steel-pointed pen. The sending key was also Vails work, along with other improvements to the receiving apparatus (weve seen some nice replicas of this key).\nA typical case for type used by printers (public domain)\nAs you may have noticed, the length of Morse code characters is inversely proportional to their frequency in English. That is, E, a common letter, is much shorter than a Z, which is far less common. Supposedly, Vail went to a local newspaper and used the type cases as a guide for letter frequencies.\nTwo Types of Code\nAmerican Morse Code (public domain)\nIt is worth noting that the code in question isnt the one we use today. It was American Morse Code which was used most often by railroads. The modern International Morse Code is somewhat similar, but several differences exist. The most notable is that dashes are not always the same length. An L is a long dash, and a zero is an even longer dash (you occasionally hear this as shorthand on the ham bands if the sender uses a straight key).\nIn addition, some letters use longer than normal spaces. For example, the letters A and B are exactly like modern code, but the letter C is two dots, a double space, and another dot. An O is a dot, a double space, and another dot.\nGerkes code from 1848 (Public Domain)\nThe gaps and different lengths caused problems with long cables, which led to Friedrich Gerke developing a derivative code in 1848. His code is essentially what we use today and uses a fixed length for dots, dashes, and spaces. There is one exception. The original Gerke code used the long-dash zero. Most of the letters in the International code are the same as the ones in the Gerke code, although when International Morse was codified in 1865, there were a few changes to some letters and numbers.\nThe telegraph was a huge success. By 1854, around 23,000 miles of lines were in operation. Western Union formed in 1851, and by 1866, there was a trans-Atlantic cable.\nWill Success Spoil Alfred Vail?\nVail, however, was not a huge success. Morse took on an influential congressman as a partner and cut Vails shares in half. That left the Vail brothers with 12.5% of the profits. In 1848, Vail was disillusioned with his $ 900-a-year salary for running the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company. He wrote to Morse:\nI have made up my mind to leave the Telegraph to take care of itself, since it cannot take care of me. I shall, in a few months, leave Washington for New Jersey,  and bid adieu to the subject of the Telegraph for some more profitable business.\nHe died less than 11 years later, in 1859. Other than researching genealogy, we didnt find much about what he did in those years.\nThe Lone Inventor Fiction\nLike most inventions, you cant just point to one person who made the leap alone. In addition to Vail and his assistant William Baxter, Joseph Henry (the inductor guy) created practical electromagnets that were essential to the operation of the telegraph. In fact, he demonstrated how an electromagnet could ring a bell at a distance, which is really all you need for a telegraph, so he has some claim, too.\nPart of the Speedwell Ironworks is now a historic site you can visit. It might not be a coincidence that the U.S. Army Signal Corps school was located in New Jersey at Camp Alfred Vail in 1919. Camp Alfred Vail would later become Fort Monmouth and was the home to the Signal Corps until the 1970s.\nThese old wired telegraphs made a clicking noise instead of a beep. Of course, wired telegraphs would give way to radio, and telegraphy of all kinds would mostly succumb to digital modes. However, you can still find the occasional Morse station.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30eb: \u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u96a0\u308c\u305f\u767a\u660e\u8005", "body": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30eb\u306f\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u6539\u826f\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3057\u3001 telegraph\u306e\u521d\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30eb: \u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u96a0\u308c\u305f\u767a\u660e\u8005", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u30d9\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u8ca2\u732e", "- \u96fb\u4fe1\u306e\u9769\u65b0: \u30d9\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9001\u4fe1\u30ad\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f", "- \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u7b26\u53f7\u3068\u56fd\u969b\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u7b26\u53f7\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- \u30d9\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u907a\u7523: \u96fb\u4fe1\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

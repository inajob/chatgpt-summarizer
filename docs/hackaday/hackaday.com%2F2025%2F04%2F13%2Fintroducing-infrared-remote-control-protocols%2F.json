Of course if youre a tough guy you dont need no stinkin integrated-circuit IR receiver implementation because you can build your own!\nBefore the video concludes there is a brief discussion about how to interpret the binary signal using a combination of long and short pulses. If this looks similar to Morse Code to you thats because it is similar to Morse Code! But not entirely the same, as you will learn if you watch the video!\n", "title": "- \u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b", "body": "YouTube\u3067\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u3084\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u91c8\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b", "- NEC\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30b3\u30eb\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3067IR\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c1\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- HS0038 IC\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u89e3\u8aad", "- \u30d0\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u89e3\u91c8\u3068\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u985e\u4f3c\u6027"]}

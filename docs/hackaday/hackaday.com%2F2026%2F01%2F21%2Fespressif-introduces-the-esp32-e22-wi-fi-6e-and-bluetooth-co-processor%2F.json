Officially referred to as a Radio Co-Processor (RCP), its intended to be used via its PCIe 2.1 or SDIO 3.0 host interface to provide wireless communications to an SoC or similar.\nThis wireless functionality includes full WiFi 6E functionality across all three bands, 160 MHz channel bandwidth and 22 MU-MIMO, making it quite a leap from the basic WiFi provided by e.g. the ESP32-S* and -C* series. There is also Bluetooth Classic and BLE 5.4 support, which is a relief for those who were missing Bluetooth Classic in all but the original ESP32 for e.g. A2DP sinks and sources.\nThe ESP32-E22 processing grunt is provided by two proprietary Espressif RISC-V CPU cores that can run at 500 MHz. At this point no details appear to be available about whether a low-power core is also present, nor any additional peripherals. Since the graphics on the Espressif PR article appear to be generic, machine-generated images  that switch the chips appearance from a BGA to an LQFP package at random  theres little more that we can gather from there either.\nCurrently Espressif is making engineering samples available to interested parties after presumed vetting, which would indicate that any kind of public release will still be a while off. Whether this chip would make for an interesting stand-alone MCU or SoC along the lines of the -S3 or -P4 will remain a bit of a mystery for a bit longer.\nThanks to [Rogan] for the tip.", "title": "- \u6700\u65b0ESP32-E22\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "body": "Espressif\u306e\u65b0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u300cESP32-E22\u300d\u306fWiFi 6E\u3084Bluetooth\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u3001\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6700\u65b0ESP32-E22\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "- WiFi 6E\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eESP32-E22\u3067\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1\u304c\u9032\u5316", "- Bluetooth Classic\u3068BLE 5.4\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7", "- ESP32-E22\u306eRISC-V CPU\u30b3\u30a2\u306b\u3088\u308b\u51e6\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "- \u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u3001\u516c\u958b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u672a\u5b9a"]}

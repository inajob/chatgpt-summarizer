First up in the news: Germanys solar and wind power generation have resulted in excess energy, which some people think is bad.

Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nThen its on to the hacks, beginning with an improved spectrometer that wasnt easy, and a rotary phone kitchen timer that kind of was.

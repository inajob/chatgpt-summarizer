Its safe to say that a portable version of one of those home computers, not in an Osborne-style luggable case but in a clamshell palmtop, would have been mind-blowing, so four decades later were fascinated by [Airrr17]s portable Sinclair ZX Spectrum.\nAt its heart is a dev board using one of the STM32F4 series microcontrollers, and running the Spectrum as an emulator. Alongside that is an LCD, and perhaps what is physically the best part of this, a Spectrum keyboard complete with BASIC keyword decals, made with large-button tactile switches that have we think, printed paper on top. Add in a small lithium-polymer cell and associated electronics in a cute little palmtop case, and its about as good a portable Sinclair as we could have imagined. All the details can be found in a GitHub repository, and as if that werent enough theres an assembly video weve placed below the break.\n\n", "title": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eSinclair ZX Spectrum\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u767b\u5834", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eSinclair ZX Spectrum \u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\u3002 STM32F4\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Spectrum\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u5b8c\u74a7\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eSinclair ZX Spectrum\u306e\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u767b\u5834", "\u4e2d\u5e74\u306e\u30ae\u30fc\u30af\u305f\u3061\u304c\u80f8\u3092\u8e8d\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3001\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebZX Spectrum\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff01", "STM32F4\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebZX Spectrum\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068BASIC\u30ad\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30c7\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30d1\u30eb\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebSinclair ZX Spectrum"]}

It becomes a question of whether we trust the huge corporate interests which control this software with such access to our daily lives, and it is vital that the browser world remains a playing field with many players in the game.\nThe mantle has traditionally fallen upon Mozillas Firefox browser to represent freedom from corporate ownership, but over the last couple of years even they have edged away from their open source ethos and morphed into an advertising company that happens to have a browser. Were asking you: can we still trust Mozillas Firefox, when the latest version turns on ad measurement by default?\nSuch has been the dominance of Googles Chromium in the browser world, that it becomes difficult to find alternatives which arent based on it. We can see the attraction for developers, instead of pursuing the extremely hard task of developing a new browser engine, just use one off-the-shelf upon which someone else has already done the work. As a result, once you have discounted browsers such as the venerable Netsurf or Dillo which are cool as heck but relatively useless for modern websites, the choices quickly descend into the esoteric. There are Ladybird and Servo which are both promising but still too rough around the edges for everyday use, so whats left? Probably LibreWolf represents the best option, a version of Firefox with a focus on privacy and security.\nWere interested in your views on this topic, because we know youll have a lot to say about it. Meanwhile if youre a Firefox user whos upgraded to version 128 and youre not sure what to do, dont panic. Find the settings page, go to Privacy and Security, and un-check the Website Advertising Preferences checkbox.", "title": "\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "body": "\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3078\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u91cd\u8981\u3067\u3001\u5de8\u5927\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3078\u306e\u4fe1\u983c\u3084\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002Firefox\u306f\u81ea\u7531\u3092\u8c61\u5fb4\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5e83\u544a\u5a92\u4f53\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4ee3\u66ff\u6848\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3068\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u91cd\u70b9\u3092\u7f6e\u3044\u305fLibreWolf\u304c\u6709\u529b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306b\u6b20\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "Mozilla Firefox\uff1a\u4f01\u696d\u6240\u6709\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u306e\u554f\u984c", "Google Chromium\u306e\u8987\u6a29\u3068\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "Ladybird\u3084Servo\uff1a\u7d04\u675f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u65b0\u8208\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306e\u73fe\u72b6", "\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3068\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u91cd\u8996\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\uff1aLibreWolf"]}

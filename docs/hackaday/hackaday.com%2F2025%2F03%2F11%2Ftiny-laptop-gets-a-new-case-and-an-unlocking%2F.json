The diminutive computers from the mid-1990s had a lot of the usual laptop features, but in an especially compact and portable case that made them a great choice for anyone with an on-the-go lifestyle.\nFast-forward thirty years or so, and the remaining Librettos havent fared too well. Many of them have cases that crumble at the slightest touch, which is what led [polymatt] to undertake this meticulous case replacement. The effort started with a complete teardown; luckily, the lower aluminum-alloy shell was in fine shape, but the upper case parts were found to be almost too deteriorated to handle. Still, with a little patience and the judicious application of tape, [polymatt] was able to scan the case pieces on a flatbed scanner and import them into his CAD package. Great tip on the blue-tack for leveling the parts for accurate scanning, by the way.\nAfter multiple rounds of printing and tweaking, [polymatt] had a case good enough to reassemble the Libretto. Unfortunately, the previous owner left an unwanted gift: a BIOS password. Disconnecting the CMOS battery didnt reset it, but a little research told him that shorting a few pins on the parallel port on the machines dock should do the trick. It was a bit involved, requiring the design and subsequent bodging of a PCB to fit into the docking port connector, but in the end he was able to wake up a machine to all its Windows 95 glory. Better get patching.\nIn a time when laptops were more like lap-crushers, the Libretto was an amazing little machine, and thirty years on, theyre well worth saving from the scrap heap. Hats off to [polymatt] for the effort to save this beauty, and if he needs tips on reading data from any PCMCIA cards that may have come with it, weve got him covered.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u518d\u751f: \u6771\u829d\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u4ea4\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Toshiba Libretto\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u4ea4\u63db\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u8a71\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u518d\u751f: \u6771\u829d\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u4ea4\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u4e2d\u53e4\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6551\u3048\uff01\u53e4\u3073\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u5287", "- CAD\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u8607\u308b\uff01\u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u4f5c\u6210\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- BIOS\u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u89e3\u9664\u306e\u6311\u6226: \u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u518d\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b: \u30ea\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u30ea\u30da\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc"]}

Thats right; this week, theyre all Quick Hacks, and thats to make room for a special series of interviews that Elliot recorded at CCCamp with the pillars of US hackerspace creation. This ones really special, do have a listen.\nWe still made room for the news this week: India launched Chandrayaan-3, which combines an orbiter, lander, and rover all in one. Then its on to the Whats That Sound results show, and while Kristina did not get it right, she did correctly identify it as being used in Whitney Houstons I Wanna Dance With Somebody, as did one of the guessers who identified it as the cowbell sound from a Roland 808.\nThen its on to the (quick) hacks, where we alternated for once just to keep things interesting. This week, Elliot is into 3D printing a clay extruder and then printing pottery with that, z-direction conductive tape, and the humble dipole antenna. Kristina is more into cyberdecks for the young and old, a reusable plant monitor, and 3D printing some cool coasters.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\n\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tGoogle Podcasts\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\n\nEpisode 233 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nChandrayaan-3: Historic India Moon mission sends new photos of lunar surface  BBC News\n\nIndia Launched A Moon Orbiter, Lander, And Rover All In One Shot With Chandrayaan-2\n\n\nHacker space movement sought for U.S.\nHacker Space Design Patterns\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Tj\u00f8rnild] who correctly guessed the cowbell sound from a Roland 808!\nAs promised, heres Whitney.\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\n3D Printing With Clay, Thanks To Custom Extruder\nA Mainframe Computer For The Modern Age\nTiny Spheres Hiding In Your Display\nWhere Did Your PCB Go Wrong?

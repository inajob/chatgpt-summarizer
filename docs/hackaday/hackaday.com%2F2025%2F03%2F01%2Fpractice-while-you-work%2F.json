The reason? I bought a horrible K40 laser cutter, and the motion controller doesn\u2019t seem to be able to do acceleration control, which means the machine rams full speed into and out of 90 degree corners, for instance. It sounds awful, and it dramatically limits how fast the laser cutter can run.\nThe plan, then, is to use a controller based on the wonderful FluidNC, but that meant making an adapter board for the flat-flex cable that connects to the X carriage, and the connector has 2 mm pin spacings instead of the usual 2.54 mm, and it just doesn\u2019t fit into any prototyping boards that I have lying around. Besides, a custom PCB adapter board just looks neater.\nI wasn\u2019t confident that I could align and drill the dozen small holes for the flat-flex connector; they didn\u2019t have much extra space around them for the copper pads. These holes had to be dead on, or risk ripping them up. And this is where I heard the voice of my old Jedi master.\nWhen you have a tricky operation coming up that requires more precision than you\u2019re immediately comfortable with, you can practice on the other parts of the project that don\u2019t demand that much precision. Pretending that they do, and taking all the care that you can, gets you in shape to tackle the truly critical bits, and if you mess up a little on the easy stuff, it\u2019s not a problem. I had more than a few pin-headers and other random holes to drill for practice anyway.\nNow of course, you could always be giving all of your projects 100% all of the time, if time is never of the essence and effort is free. In the real world, you don\u2019t always want to work at maximum precision. Good enough is often good enough.\nBut there\u2019s also a time and a place for practicing precision, especially when you see a need for it up ahead. Drilling the big holes dead center got me back in the swing of things, and they needed to get drilled one way or the other. I find it useful to think about the job first, plan ahead where the tricky bits are going to be, and then treat the \u201ceasy\u201d stuff along the way as practice for the more demanding operations.

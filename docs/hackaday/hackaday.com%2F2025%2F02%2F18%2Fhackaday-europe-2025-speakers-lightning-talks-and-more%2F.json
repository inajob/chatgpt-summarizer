Were excited to announce the first slice of our wonderful speakers lineup! Get your tickets now,\nHackaday Europe is going down again in Berlin this year on March 15th and 16th at MotionLab. Its Hackaday, but in real life, and it\u2019s too much fun.\u00a0 The badge is off-the-scale cool, powered by the incredible creativity of our community who entered the Supercon SAO contest last fall, and were absolutely stoked to be tossing the four winning entries into your schwag bag in Europe.\nIf you already know youll be attending and would like to give a seven-minute Lightning Talk on Sunday, were also opening up the call for talks there. Tell us now what youd like to talk about so we can all hear it on Sunday morning.\nWere looking forward to the talks and to seeing you all there! Were getting the last few speakers ironed out, have a keynote talk to announce, and, of course, will open up workshop signups. So stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\nBunnie Huang\nSeeing Through Silicon with IRIS Imaging\nIRIS (InfraRed, In-Situ) is a technique for imaging silicon chips in CSP-type packages without removing them from the circuit board. In this short talk, Ill go over the basics of how the technique works, show a couple of ways to implement it, and share some images of chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSera Evcimen\nHardware Startup/Product Pitfalls\nThis talk is designed to demystify what causes failures and help hardware startups and innovation projects navigate the complex journey of hardware development by identifying and avoiding common pitfalls. With a focus on providing some examples and actionable strategies, it aims to equip teams to overcome challenges and build a strong foundation for success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErik Bosman\nCreating light sculptures for fun and,  mostly for fun.\nThis talk will be about solving interesting problems that I created for myself in the process of creating light sculptures:\n Calculating polyhedral shapes\n Turning those into laser-cut pieces, or oddly-shaped PCBs\n Various methods of routing and driving LEDs\n and creating software that takes advantage of the sculptural nature of the light installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNiklas Roy\nVectors, Pixels, Plotters and Public Participation\nIn his talk, Niklas will highlight some of his latest projects that use DIY machines to involve communities in creating art together. From a graffiti robot to a giant mosaic that was designed by an entire neighborhood with the help of a mobile arcade machine, he\u2019ll share the stories behind his inventions. He will discuss his sources of inspiration, the creative process and thoughts about inclusiveness guiding the development of the machines, and the joy of watching diverse people interact with and contribute to these unconventional art pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel B\u00fcchele and Andre Zibell\nDeveloping a NFC-based decentralized payment system for a music festival\nFor a small volunteer-run music festival we designed and built a custom decentralized NFC payment system. Due to the nature of the festival, the design of the system and hardware had some unique requirements: It had to be fully decentralized and not rely on network connection, which created some interesting security challenges. We also developed custom hardware terminals (based on ESP32) to be used at point-of-sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Geppert, Anders Nielsen, and Pierre Muth\nThe Core64  NeonPixels  65uino collaboration\nJoin us to learn how three unique Hackaday projects came together to create something new for 1975, thanks to international collaboration. (Yes, thats 50 years ago!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlun Morris\nHalf-size Hacking: 0.05 Matrix Boards Under the Microscope\nHow do you make a prototype really tiny without designing a PCB? What you need to get started. How do you connect to standard modules with 0.1 headers? And the worlds smallest multi-channel voltmeter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Dakhno\nHacking a pinball machine\nThis talk explains how we modernized a classic pinball machine by replacing the mechanical guts with a Raspberry Pi, multiple STM32, and a CAN bus, creating infrastructure that can be exploited far beyond the realm of our project.\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30fb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d12023\u958b\u50ac\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\u57fa\u8abf\u8b1b\u6f14\u3084\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u60c5\u5831", "body": "Hackaday Europe\u304c3\u6708\u306b\u30d9\u30eb\u30ea\u30f3\u3067\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3001\u8b1b\u6f14\u8005\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u8ca9\u58f2\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30fb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d12023\u958b\u50ac\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\u57fa\u8abf\u8b1b\u6f14\u3084\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u60c5\u5831", "- IRIS\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853\u3067\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6210\u529f\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u7a74\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- DIY\u6a5f\u68b0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u5275\u9020\u3068\u53c2\u52a0\u578b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- NFC\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u796d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5206\u6563\u578b\u6c7a\u6e08\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u958b\u767a\u79d8\u8a71"]}

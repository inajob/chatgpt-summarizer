Sometimes theyre recoverable, and a few bodge wires will make em good. Sometimes theyre too far gone and we have to start again. But what if you could take an existing PCB, make a few mods, and turn it into the one you really want? Thats what PCB Renewal aims to do, as per the research paper from [Huaishu Peng] and the research group at the University of Maryland.\nThe plugin quantifies resource and time savings made by reusing an old board.\nThe concept is straightforward  PCB Renewal exists as a KiCad plugin that can analyze the differences between the PCB you have and the one you really want. Assuming theyre similar enough, it will generate toolpaths to modify the board with milling and epoxy deposition to create the traces you need out of the board you already have.\nObviously, there are limitations. Youll never turn a PlayStation motherboard into something you could drop into an Xbox with a tool like this. Instead, its more about gradual modifications. Say you need to correct a couple of misplaced traces or missing grounds, or you want to swap one microcontroller for a similar unit on your existing board. Rather than making brand new PCBs, you could modify the ones you already have.\nOf course, its worth noting that if you already have the hardware to do epoxy deposition and milling, you could probably just make new PCBs whenever you need them. However, PCB Renewal lets you save resources by not manufacturing new boards when you dont have to.\nWeve seen work from [Huaishu Peng]s research group before, too, in the form of an innovative solderless PCB.\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044PCB\u3092\u518d\u751f\uff01\u30ea\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u3067\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "PCB Renewal\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u6539\u826f\u3057\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308bKiCad\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044PCB\u3092\u518d\u751f\uff01\u30ea\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u3067\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- PCB\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\uff1aKiCad\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u6539\u826f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "- \u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u6642\u9593\u3092\u7bc0\u7d04\u3059\u308bPCB\u306e\u6539\u9020\u6280\u8853", "- \u65e2\u5b58\u306ePCB\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a8\u30b3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01PCB Renewal\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u306f"]}

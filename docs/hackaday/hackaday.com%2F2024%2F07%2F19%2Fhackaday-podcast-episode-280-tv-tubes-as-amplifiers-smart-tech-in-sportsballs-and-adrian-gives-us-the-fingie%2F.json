Come along for the ride as Dan betrays his total ignorance of soccer/football, much to Elliots amusement. But its all about keeping the human factor in sports, so we suppose it was worth it. Less controversially, we ogled over a display of PCB repair heroics, analyzed a reverse engineering effort that got really lucky, and took a look at an adorable one-transistor ham transceiver. We also talked about ants doing surgery, picking locks with nitric acid, a damn cute dam, and how to build one of the worlds largest machines from scratch in under a century. Plus, we answered the burning question: can a CRT be used as an audio amplifier? Yes, kind of, but please dont let the audiophiles know or well never hear the end of it.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nWorried about attracting the Black Helicopters?

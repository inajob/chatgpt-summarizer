Hes working through circuit examples from the awesome book The Art of Electronics. In the latest installment, hes looking at a pulse generator that uses bipolar transistors. So far, there are 43 videos covering different exercises.\nIf youve read the book  and you should  you know the examples and exercises sometimes have little explanation. Honestly, thats good. You should try to work through them yourself first. But once you have an idea of how it works, hearing someone give their take on it may help you out. In fact, even if you dont have the book, wed suggest pausing the video and looking at the circuit to see what you can figure out before playing the explanation. Youll learn more that way.\nAdmittedly, some of the early videos will be cakewalks for Hackaday readers. The first few, for example, walk through parallel and series resistors. However, if you are starting out or just want a refresher, you can probably enjoy all of them. The later ones get a bit more challenging.\nIf you want to double-check your work, you can simulate the circuit, too. Our simulation got 4.79 V and he computed 4.8, which is certainly close enough.\nWe do love The Art of Electronics. The books author also enjoys listening for aliens.\n\n"}

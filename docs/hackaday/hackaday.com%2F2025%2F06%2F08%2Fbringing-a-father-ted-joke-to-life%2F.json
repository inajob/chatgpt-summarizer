In the first version, he modified a tape dispenser to house a Raspberry Pi, enabling voice functionality. In the new version, he replaced the Raspberry Pi with a cheaper ESP8266 and designed an entirely 3D printed dispenser that looks closer to the screen-used version.\nA clever change was replacing the rotary encoder with a custom encoder embedded in the printed parts. Using a photodiode and an LED, it measures the tape pulled from the spool. As you pull the tape, the encoder calculates the length and announces it through the speaker, just like in the show.\nIf youre into prop recreations like this, be sure to check out the winners of our 2022 Sci-Fi Contest.\n\n", "title": "- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e sitcom \u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "body": "\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30fb\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30cd\u30bf\u304b\u3089\u3001\u8a71\u3059\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u578b\u306fESP8266\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u97f3\u58f0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- 90\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e sitcom \u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "- Raspberry Pi\u304b\u3089ESP8266\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305f\u8a71\u3059\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30da\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u904e\u7a0b", "- \u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3057\u305f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9577\u3055\u6e2c\u5b9a\u6a5f\u80fd", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u518d\u73fe\uff012022 Sci-Fi\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u53d7\u8cde\u4f5c\u54c1\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

He had a Manncorp/Autotronik MC384V2 pick and place, and needed more feeders. The company was reluctant to support an older machine and wanted over $32,000 to supply [Chris] with more feeders. He contemplated the expenditure but then came across another project which gave him pause. Could he make Siemens feeders work with his machine?\nIts one of those standing on the shoulders of giants stories, with [Chris] building on the work from [Bilsef] and the OpenPNP project. He came across SchultzController, which could be used to work with Siemens Siplace feeders for pick-and-place machines. They were never supposed to work with his Manncorp machine, but it seemed possible to knit them together in some kind of unholy production-focused marriage. [Chris] explains how he hooked up the Manncorp hardware to a Smoothieboard and then Bilsefs controller boards to get everything working, along with all the nitty gritty details on the software hacks required to get everything playing nice.\nFor an investment of just $2,500, [Chris] has been able to massively expand the number of feeders on his machine. Now, hes got his pick and place building more Smoothieboards faster than ever, with less manual work on his part.\nWe feature a lot of one-off projects and home production methods, but its nice to also get a look at methods of more serious production in bigger numbers, too. Its a topic we follow with interest. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Editors note: Siemens is the parent company of Supplyframe, which is Hackadays parent company. This has nothing to do with this story.]"}

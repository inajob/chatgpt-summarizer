Cut fingers and jagged edges are never far away, so [Kevin Cheung]s work in making an easy can cutter is definitely worth a look.\nTaking inspiration from a rotary can opener, he uses a pair of circular blades in an adjustable injection moulded plastic frame. If youve used a pipe cutter than maybe you are familiar with the technique, as the blade rotates round the can a few times it slowly scores and cuts through the metal. Doing the job at both ends of the can reveals a tube, which cna be then cut with scissors and flattened to make a rectangular metal sheet. Those edges are probably sharp, but nothing like the jagged finger-cutters youd get doing the same by hand. The full video can be seen below the break, and the files to 3D print the plastic parts of the cutter can be found at the bottom of a page describing the use of cans to make a shingle roof.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7f36\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u5207\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u9053\u5177\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u65cb\u56de\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u88fd\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7f36\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "- \u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7f36\u3092\u5207\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u56de\u8ee2\u5f0f\u7f36\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30ca\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3076\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u306a\u7f36\u30ab\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u91d1\u5c5e\u3067\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff01\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u7f36\u306e\u5229\u7528\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7f36\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

It comes at a price, though; most of us probably know what its like for the slightest wrong move to send a part the size of a grain of sand into another dimension.\nTo help make testing these parts a little easier, [IMSAI Guy] has come up with this clever little SMD test fixture. Its designed to hook up to another custom board, which in turn connects to a wonderful old Hewlett-Packard 4275A LCR meter. The jig is based on two pogo pins mounted directly across from each other on a scrap of single-clad PCB. The spring-loaded contacts, which short together when not in use, are pulled apart to load an SMD part, like the 1-\u03bcH inductors shown in the video below. The pins hold the component firmly and make good electrical contact, allowing hands-free testing without the risk of an errant touch of the test probes sending it flying.\nWhile the test fixture works well for larger SMDs, we could see this being a bit fussy for smaller parts. That would be easy enough to fix with perhaps some 3D-printed arms that retract the pogo pins symmetrically, holding them open until the part is loaded. A centering fixture might help too, as would a clear shield to contain any parts that get the urge to go for a ride. But, for the tactical application [IMSAI Guy] has in mind, this sure seems like enough.\nJust getting into surface mount? If so, you might want to check out this handy guide to the often cryptic markings used on SMD parts.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578b\u56de\u8def\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306aSMD\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "SMD\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u304c\u767b\u5834-\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u624b\u52a9\u3051+(\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u63b2\u8f09)", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578b\u56de\u8def\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306aSMD\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc", "\u624b\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u305a\u306bSMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "SMD\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

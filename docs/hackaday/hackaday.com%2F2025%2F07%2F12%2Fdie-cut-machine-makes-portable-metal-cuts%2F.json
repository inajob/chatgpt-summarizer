The metal is thin enough to cut by hand, but hed started using a manual die-cutting machine, and it worked well. The problem? The machine was big and heavy, weighing well over 30 pounds. The solution was to get a lightweight die cutter. It worked better than expected, but [Kevin] really wanted it to be more portable, so he stripped it down and built the mechanism into a new case.\nThe video below isnt quite a how-to video, but if you like watching someone handcraft something with a lot of skill, youll enjoy it. It also might give you ideas about how you could use one of these cutters, even if you dont bother building a nice case for it.\nWeve seen cutters that use computer control, but they arent inexpensive. They will, however, make the same kind of cuts. But these manual die cutters are very inexpensive, and you simply have to find a way to make the die. You can easily make them for cutting paper, and, with the right materials, you can make the kind you see in [Kevin]s video, too.\nWe have to admit, carrying the gizmo into a public place seemed to make a lot of people happy. So maybe portability is a good goal. But either way, you can have some fun with a machine like that.\nIf you want to cut paper, these work great. If you want paper to make the cuts, we have just the thing for you.\n\n", "title": "- \u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u624b\u52d5\u30c0\u30a4\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30b1\u30d3\u30f3\u306f\u8efd\u91cf\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u643a\u5e2f\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u624b\u52d5\u30c0\u30a4\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\uff01\u53e4\u3044\u7f36\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30c0\u30a4\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u5de5\u5177\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u624b\u52d5\u30c0\u30a4\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5"]}

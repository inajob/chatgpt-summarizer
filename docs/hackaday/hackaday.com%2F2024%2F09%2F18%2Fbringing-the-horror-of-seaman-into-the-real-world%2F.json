In actually, calling it a game might be something of a stretch. It was more of a pet simulator, where you need to feed and care for a virtual animal as it grows. Except rather than something like a dog or a rabbit, your pet is a talking fish with a human face that doesnt seem to like you very much. Oh, and Leonard Nimoy is there too for some reason.\nMost people in the world dont even know this game ever existed, and frankly, their lives are all the better for it. But for those who lovingly cared for (or intentionally killed) one of these rude creatures back in the early 2000s, its an experience that sticks with you. Which we assume is why [Robert Prest] decided to build this incredibly faithful physical recreation of Seaman.\u00a0\n\nThe creature itself is a wireless animatronic thats been fitted with several servos to operate not just its creepy human mouth, but its flippers, legs, and tail. [Robert] pulled the original speech clips from the game, and recreated most of the voice recognition prompts so he can converse with his pet monster. A Dreamcast controller is used to interact with the robo-seaman, but even thats a bit of a hack. Its actually just the shell of the controller which has been filled with new hardware, namely an ESP8266 and Nokia LCD that take the place of the original Visual Memory Unit (VMU).\n\n[Robert] went the extra mile and also recreated the tank the creature lives in. The front glass is actually a transparent display that can show game information or water, and theres sonar sensors that can detect when somebody has reached into it. The original games interactive elements involved adjusting the temperature of the tank and feeding your growing abomination, which are represented in this physical incarnation. Theres even little 3D printed versions of the bugs (which incidentally also have human faces) raise as food for the creature.\nWhile this might not be our ideal office decoration, but weve got to hand it to [Robert], he did a hell of job bringing Seaman to life. Now lets just hope it doesnt escape its tank and get into the wild.\n", "title": "\u30bb\u30ac\u306eDreamcast\u7528\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5947\u629c\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5b9f\u7269\u518d\u73fe", "body": "\u30bb\u30ac\u306eDreamcast\u5411\u3051\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5947\u5999\u306a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSeaman\u300d\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u8981\u7d04\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3084\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bb\u30ac\u306eDreamcast\u7528\u306b\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u5947\u629c\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5b9f\u7269\u518d\u73fe", "\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u5fe0\u5b9f\u3055\uff01\u30bb\u30ac\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSeaman\u300d\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u518d\u73fe", "\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSeaman\u300d\u3092\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306b\u518d\u73fe", "\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSeaman\u300d\u306e\u518d\u73fe", "Dreamcast\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300cSeaman\u300d\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9"]}

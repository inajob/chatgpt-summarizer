No, of course not. Will it run a large language model (LLM)? Given the huge buildout of compute power to do just that, many people would scoff at the very notion. But [Yeo Kheng Meng] is not many people.\nHe has set up various DOS computers to run a stripped down version of the Llama 2 LLM, originally from Meta. More specifically, [Yeo Kheng Meng] is implementing [Andreq Karpathy]s Llama2.c library, which we have seen here before, running on Windows 98.\nLlama2.c is a wonderful bit of programming that lets one inference a trained Llama2 model in only seven hundred lines of C. It it is seven hundred lines of modern C, however, so porting to DOS 6.22 and the outdated i386 architecture took some doing. [Yeo Kheng Meng] documents that work, and benchmarks a few retrocomputers. As painful as it may be to say  yes, a 486 or a Pentium 1 can now be counted as retro.\nThe models are not large, of course, with TinyStories-trained\u00a0 260 kB model churning out a blistering 2.08 tokens per second on a generic 486 box. Newer machines can run larger models faster, of course. Ironically a Pentium M Thinkpad T24 (was that really 21 years ago?) is able to run a larger 110 Mb model faster than [Yeo Kheng Meng]s modern Ryzen 5 desktop. Not because the Pentium M is going blazing fast, mind you, but because a memory allocation error prevented that model from running on the modern CPU. Slow and steady finishes the race, it seems.\nThis port will run on any 32-bit i386 hardware, which leaves the 16-bit regime as the next challenge. If one of you can get an Llama 2 hosted locally on an 286 or a 68000-based machine, then we may have to stop asking Does it run DOOM? and start asking Will it run an LLM?\n\n", "title": "- 486\u3084Pentium\u3067Llama 2\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u6311\u6226", "body": "486\u3084Pentium 1\u3067Llama 2\u304c\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- 486\u3084Pentium\u3067Llama 2\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u6311\u6226", "- DOS\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067\u306eLLM\u5b9f\u884c\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u904b\u7528\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- Windows 98\u3067Llama2.c\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305fAI\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

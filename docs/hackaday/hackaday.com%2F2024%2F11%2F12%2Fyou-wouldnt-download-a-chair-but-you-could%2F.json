Hes a big fan of the lovely Fortune Chair from Heller Furniture. Only, he didnt want to pay $1,175 for a real one. The solution? He printed his own instead!\nThe basic concept is simple. Capture or recreate the geometry of the fancy expensive designer chair, and then print it out on a 3D printer. That\u00a0would be easy, except for scale. Chairs have to be both big enough to seat humans, and strong enough to carry their weight. For the average 3D printer owner, meeting the big requirement is difficult, since most printers are quite small compared to chairs.\n[Morley] gets around this in the typical fashion\u2014he prints the chair in multiple segments. Indeed, weve seen [Morley] tackle a similar project before, too. Only, last time, he had the benefit of a print farm and some easily-accessible geometry for the target object. This time, hes working very much more from scratch, and chose to print everything at home. That made things quite a bit harder.\nScaling up is never as easy at it seems at first!\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u6905\u5b50\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30e2\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u6905\u5b50\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u5206\u5272\u5370\u5237\u3057\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u6905\u5b50\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u6311\u6226", "\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30a2\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u5370\u5237\uff1a\u6905\u5b50\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u96e3\u3057\u3055", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u958b\u304f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5922\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u6905\u5b50\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u5f0f\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u5229\u70b9\uff1a\u6905\u5b50\u3092\u5206\u5272\u3057\u3066\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

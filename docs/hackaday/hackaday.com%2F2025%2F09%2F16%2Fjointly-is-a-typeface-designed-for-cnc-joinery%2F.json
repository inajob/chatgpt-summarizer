That would be too easy for [CobyUnger]. His typeface Jointly is the first weve seen thats meant to be used as joinery.\nThe idea is simple: carve mortises that take the shape of letters in one piece, and carve matching letter-tenons into the end of another. Push them together, and voila: a joint! To get this concept to work reliably, the font did have to be specially designed  both the inner and outer contours need to be accessible to a rotary cutting tool. Cutting tools get harder to use the smaller they go (or more fragile, at any rate) so with Jointly, the design spec was that any letters over 3/4 (19.05 mm) tall needed to be handled with a 1/8 (3.175 mm) rotary cutter.\nThis gives the font a friendly curved appearance we find quite fetching. Of course if youre going to be cutting tenons into the end of a board, youre going to need either some serious z-depth or an interesting jig to get the end of the board under the cutting head. It looks like [CobyUnger] has both, but he mentions the possibility of using a handheld CNC router as the cheaper option.\nSpeaking of routing out type, do you know the story of Gorton? You cant make joinery with that typeface, but youve almost certainly seen it.", "title": "- CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Jointly\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "body": "CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u306e\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u5c02\u7528\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u300cJointly\u300d\u306f\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Jointly\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u7279\u6b8a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305fJointly\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3001\u6728\u6750\u52a0\u5de5\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308bCNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff01Jointly\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\uff1aJointly\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3/4\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01Jointly\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u52a0\u5de5\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

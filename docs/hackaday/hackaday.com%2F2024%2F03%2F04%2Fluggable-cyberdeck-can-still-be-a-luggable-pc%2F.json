Planted firmly between a desktop and a laptop, these machines were lovingly called so because they were portable, but just barely. Think Kaypro, Osborne, or the Compaq Portable.\nFirst things first  this lovely 1990-era industrial luggable has not been gutted according to [D1g1t4l_G33k]. The chassis, CRT, power supply, and ISA backplane are original and still intact, and they still have all the parts to restore it to its original DOS 3.1 form.\nWhat [D1g1t4l_G33k] did do is replace the 386x-based ISA SBC with a 2005 AMD LX-600 Geode at 366 MHz. Gone are the ISA data acquisition cards and 80 MB SCSI hard drive, replaced with a 32 GB compact flash drive. The floppy drive is functional, too. Now it sits on a cart next to the workbench running AntiX Core 19.5, functioning happily as an AVR development workstation.\nHaving an old luggable to mess with in the first place isnt a requirement. Weve seen a modern take on the luggable, and heres one with three monitors.", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30e9\u30c3\u30ac\u30d6\u30ebPC\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b", "body": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u304b\u308990\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306b\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\u4e00\u7a2e\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306f\u300cluggable\u300d\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u3001\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9593\u306b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002Kaypro\u3001Osborne\u3001Compaq Portable\u306a\u3069\u304c\u305d\u306e\u4ee3\u8868\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30e9\u30c3\u30ac\u30d6\u30ebPC\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306aPC\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308b\u624b\u9806", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30e9\u30c3\u30ac\u30d6\u30ebPC\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u53ef\u80fd\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u30e9\u30c3\u30ac\u30d6\u30ebPC\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9"]}

There will be some mild spoilers. You have been warned.\nWhile the show does have some moments that will make your science brain cringe, there is one scene that shows a computer that could actually be built. Would it be practical? Probably not in real life, but in the context provided by the show, it was perfectly feasible. It could have, however, been done a little better, but the idea was  like many great ideas  both deceptively simple and amazingly profound. The computer was made of human beings. Im not talking like Dunes mentats  humans with super brains augmented by drugs or technology. This is something very different.\nBackground\nThis is your last chance. There are spoilers ahead, although Ill try to leave out as much as I can. In the story, top scientists receive a mysterious headset that allows them to experience totally immersive holodeck-style virtual reality. When they put the headset on, they are in what appears to be a game. The game puts you in a historical location  the court of Henry VIII or Ghengis Kahn. However, this Earth has three suns. The planet is sometimes in a nicely habitable zone and sometimes is not. The periods when the planet is uninhabitable might have everything bursting into flames or freezing, or there might not be sufficient gravity to hold them on the planets surface. (Although Ill admit, I found that one hard to grasp.)\nApparently, the inhabitants of this quasi-Earth can hibernate through the chaotic eras and wait for the next stable era that lasts a long time. The problem, as you probably know, is that there is no general closed-form solution for the three-body problem. Of course, there are approximations and special cases, but it isnt easy to make long-term predictions about the state of three bodies, even with modern computers.\n\nThe Great Kahn\nOf course, the court of Ghengis Kahn didnt have computers, but they could have, as the show demonstrated. In one scene, some players of the game are passing by row after row of soldiers.\nAt first, you think it is just a show of military force for some reason. However, two other players announce that they can solve the riddle of when the next chaotic era will arrive and how long it will last. You can see that the field of soldiers is vast, and there are towers strategically placed.\nThe towers probably communicate between different sections.\nOn a command to run a program, the soldiers begin twisting poles they are holding with large cards on them. One side of the card is white, and the other black.\nIt doesnt take much to realize that one color is a binary 1, and the other is a binary 0. The soldiers each follow rules to form logic gates. You can assume the towers gather up results and send them to other towers. Riders on horseback carry the results up to the player who is with the Kahn.\nPracticality\nThis could obviously be made to work. Each soldiers rules would determine what kind of logic gate it was. For example: look at the soldier to your right and your left. If both of their cards are black, show your black card. Otherwise, show your white card. Theres an OR gate. An AND gate or an inverter would be just as easy.\nYou cant tell me this doesnt look like a CPU die under low magnification\nOf course, the entire setup looks like an IC die, so in real life, youd probably have problems getting so many people together and trained. However, this is virtual reality, so it seems about as feasible as making a CPU in, say, Minecraft. It would be easy to write rules for higher-level functions, too. For example, different flip flops, multiplexers, and demultiplexers could be rule-based like in Verilog, instead of made from gates.\nThere are a few other practical considerations. It isnt totally clear on the TV show, but it seems like the system is asynchronous. Thats hard to design, so we usually use synchronous designs. I mentioned flip flop rules earlier. It seems like some instructions to the human elements would start with the phrase When you hear the drum beat The drummer, then, would be like a clock.\nOf course, on a large FPGA, you have to worry about getting the clock signal to everyone simultaneously and youd have the same problem here. Perhaps youd use pipelining to have a local clock that then hands off to a different clock domain. Maybe a mirror on a tower could help synchronize the clocks.\nThe other problem is that humans make mistakes far more often than digital logic. So, like a relay or quantum computer, it would probably help to detect errors and maybe even make corrections in the system. Of course, we dont know that it didnt have that. In the end, the computer didnt work. However, we dont know if that was due to error or the general problem of solving the equations numerically. Even today, it takes a lot of CPU power to do that and we cant imagine the human computer is very fast.\nSo?\nIs this really practical? In theory, yes, although we dont have enough friends to put together something that big. You might be able to devise a scheme to do it over the Internet, but that doesnt seem as impressive. Perhaps at the next Supercon, well try to put together a full adder. You could use people as traditional gates or even relays.\nTrue, back in the old days, a computer was, in fact, the job of a person who did math to build things like tables. But that is different still. The Three Body Problem computer could take people with little skill, teach them a simple rule, and then get the benefits of a modern digital computer. You just need a tremendous number of people.\nWe are always fascinated by how, once you understand the concept, you can make a computer from almost anything. So, using this method, fluidic logic, or marbles, people like the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, or Romans could have had computers. What would they have done with them?"}

Inside such a probe youll usually find a fancy op-amp working as a differential amplifier, and for correct operation they require careful adjustment to null out DC bias and achieve the maximum common mode rejection. We particularly like [Craig D]s probe, because these adjustments are taken care of automatically by a microcontroller.\nThe analogue path provides a lesson for anyone interested in instrumentation signal path design, with the signal conditioning and compensation circuits feeding an AD8130 differential amplifier. Another amplifier samples the output voltage and feeds it to the ADC in the microcontroller. Common mode adjustment is taken care of by a digital potentiometer chip, and DC offset by the microcontrollers DAC. Controlling all this is an ATSAMD10 chip, and the power is derived from the scopes USB interface.\nAll in all its an extremely well-executed device, and one wed be happy to have on our bench at any time. Its by no means the first differential probe weve brought you, heres another.\n\u00a0The HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "title": "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u5dee\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30b5\u30fc\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u9593\u306e\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5dee\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3082\u3042\u308b\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u597d\u304d\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u6709\u7528\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u6761\u4ef6\u4ed8\u3051\u3084\u88dc\u511f\u56de\u8def\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u5dee\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u96fb\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u7d4c\u8def\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5dee\u52d5\u5897\u5e45\u5668\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30dd\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3068\u30e2\u30c7\u30ebDAC\u306b\u3088\u308bDC\u30aa\u30d5\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u89e3\u6d88\u65b9\u6cd5", "ATSAMD10\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u512a\u308c\u305f\u5dee\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5dee\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6"]}

The horror! If youre not able to do as we did yesterday and borrow a pack until more can be bought, then youre not without options. A handy copy of the Daily Mail could be cut into squares and hung up in your Smallest Room, or you can even make your own with the help of this handy instructional video from [whoisandrewfahmy]. It appears from a casual search to be one of many such guides that appeared during the pandemic when the bog roll supply was seen as endangered, but its still interesting simply as a diversion into how something is made.\nThe process is surprisingly straightforward, starting with scrap paper, which is shredded and soaked before being boiled to break down to pulp. The pulp is then emulsified, and some body oil is added to remove the sandpaper-on-the-butt experience before being spread between a sheet and a piece of window screen to be ironed dry. Its an energy-intensive process, so the Daily Mail is likely to be an easier stopgap if no friends can lend you a few rolls, but its left us here curious about papermaking. The butts of Hackaday may be safe from homemade TP, but thats not to say that it wouldnt be interesting to make other paper products. Check out the video below.\nOf course, back in April 2020 we had our own solution to the pandemic toilet paper shortage. After you make your bespoke dunny roll, how can you wind it into a nice roll? Dont worry. We got you.\n\n"}

Advancements and breakthroughs mean that what was once state-of-the-art all too soon finds itself collecting dust. But there are exceptions. Perhaps because theyre so much more visible to us than other types of components, many styles of displays have managed to carve out their own niche and stick around. Even for the display types that we no longer see used in consumer hardware, their unique aesthetic qualities often live on in media, art, and design.\nThis year, to coincide with Hackaday Supercon, the folks at Supplyframes DesignLab want to pay tribute to display technology past and present with a special exhibit  and they need your help to make it possible. If you have a display youd like to show off, fill out this form and tell them what youve got. Just be sure to do it by September 16th.\nFor the larger specimens, it would be ideal if youre somewhat local to Southern California, but otherwise, theyre looking for submissions from all over the world. The exhibit will open on the first day of Supercon and run throughout November.\nDont worry. Theyre only looking to raid your parts bin temporarily. Any hardware sent in to be part of the exhibit will be considered on loan, and theyll make sure it gets back to where it belongs by January 31st, 2025. The goal is to show the displays on and operational, so in most cases, thats going to mean sending over a complete device. But if its possible to isolate the display itself and still demonstrate what it would look like in operation, sending along just the bare display is an option.\nOf course, there are examples where the display itself is so fundamental as to be inseparable; what would the Sharp EL-8 have been without that gorgeous vacuum fluorescent display (VFD)? In that case, please dont tear apart some classic device on our account. Just explain what the device is, and the DesignLab will see if they can make the appropriate accommodations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for some inspiration? Heres just a few of the different display types the DesignLab is looking for, in no particular order:\n\nNixie Tubes\nVacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFDs)\nPlasma Displays\nColor/BW Cathode-Ray Tubes (CRTs)\nRound Displays\nNumitrons\nDekatrons\nColor/Grayscale ePaper/eInk\nAlphanumeric Segmented LEDs\nNon-English Segmented LEDs\nFlip-Disc/Flip-Dot\nRefreshable Braille Displays\nVolumetric Displays\nDisplays with Unusual Fonts\n\nKeep in mind that the display doesnt need to be commercially produced either. If youve built a custom display that uses any of these core technologies (such as a homebrew segmented LED display), wed love to see it.\nSpread the Word!\nIf youre reading Hackaday, theres an excellent chance youve got some cool hardware buried in your closet or stuffed in a drawer somewhere thats been waiting for a moment like this to shine again. But even if you dont, we bet you know somebody who does, so please share the submission form with any individuals or groups you think might be interested.\nWith the communitys help, this exhibit promises to be a fascinating addition to Hackaday Supercon.", "title": "\"Hackaday Supercon\u306b\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c55\u793a\u4f1a\u3067\u3001\u82e5\u8005\u306e\u5354\u529b\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\"", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u5e38\u306b\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u985e\u578b\u304c\u6839\u4ed8\u304d\u7d9a\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u4eca\u5e74\u3001Hackaday Supercon\u3068Supplyframes DesignLab\u304c\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u3092\u7279\u96c6\u3059\u308b\u7279\u5225\u5c55\u793a\u3092\u958b\u50ac\u3057\u3001\u5c55\u793a\u54c1\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3092\u547c\u3073\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u7a2e\u985e\u3084\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3082\u6b53\u8fce\u3002", "titles": ["\"Hackaday Supercon\u306b\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5c55\u793a\u4f1a\u3067\u3001\u82e5\u8005\u306e\u5354\u529b\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\"", "\"\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3078\u306e\u656c\u610f\"", "\"\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30bd\u30f3\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u306e\u30d1\u30b9\u3068\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\"", "\"\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30bd\u30f3\u306e\u7279\u5225\u306a\u5c55\u793a\u4f1a\u3067\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\"", "\"\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6280\u8853\u306e\u904e\u53bb\u3068\u73fe\u5728\u3078\u306e\u30c8\u30ea\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\""]}

Once used, they can be recycled or as this paper charmingly puts it, become ore for urban mining techniques. The technique under discussion in the Chemical Engineering Journal is one that extracts metallic silver from e-waste using fatty acids and hydrogen peroxide.\nThis graphical abstract gives the rough idea.\nRight now, recycling makes up about 17% of the global silver supply. As rich sources of ore dry up, and the world moves to more sustainable footing, that number can only go up. Recycling e-waste already happens, of course, but in messy, dangerous processes that are generally banned in the eloped world. (Like open burning, of plastic, gross.)\nThis paper describes a green process that even the most fervant granola-munching NIMBY wouldnt mind have in their neighborhood: hot fatty acids (AKA oil) are used as an organic solvent to dissolve metals from PCB and wire. The paper mentions sourcing the solvent from waste sunflower, safflower or canola oil. As you might imagine, most metals, silver included, are not terribly soluble in sunflower oil, but a little refining and the addition of 30% hydrogen peroxide changes that equation.\nMore than just Ag is picked up in this process, but the oils do select for silver over other metals. The paper presents a way to then selectively precipitate out the silver as silver oleate using ethanol and flourescent light. The oleate compound can then be easily washed and burnt to produce pure silver.\nThe authors of the paper take the time to demonstrate the process on a silver-plated keyboard connector, so there is proof of concept on real e-waste. Selecting for silver means leaving behind gold, however, so were not sure how the economics of this method will stack up.\nOf course, when Hackaday talks about recycling e-waste, its usually more on the reuse part of reduce, reuse, recycle.\u00a0 After all, one mans e-waste is another mans parts binor priceless historical artifact.\nThanks to [Brian] for the tip.Your tips can be easily recycled into Hackaday posts through an environmentally-friendly process via our tipsline.\u00a0"}

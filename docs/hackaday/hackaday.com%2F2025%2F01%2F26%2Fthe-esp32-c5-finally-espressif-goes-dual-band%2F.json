Weve seen a bunch of versions over the years with both Tensilica and RISC-V cores, but so far the ones with radios have all only serviced 2.4 GHz WiFi. Thats about to change to include 5GHz with the new C5 variant though, and [Andreas Speiss] has been lucky enough to get his hands on a prototype dev kit\nIts very similar to the C6, which were already used to beyond the dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio from a software point of view. The C5 is so new that the company has yet to incorporate the new chip into the Arduino IDE. He shows it working and detecting both networks though, and speculates a little about its eventual marketing.\nInteresting to us is the dual-band antenna, with branches for both frequencies on the same PCB. Wed be interested to see the real-world performance of this, and also whether they produce a version with separate outputs for each band. The full video is below the break. In the meantime, watch out for this chip appearing on the market.\nIts not the only Espresif chip were anticipating at the moment.\n\n"}

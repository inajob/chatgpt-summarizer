In a historically close race, American sprinter Noah Lyles narrowly edged out Jamaica\u2019s Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second. The final decision relied on an image captured by an Omega photo finish camera that shoots an astonishing 40,000 frames per second.\nThis cutting-edge technology, originally reported by PetaPixel, ensured the accuracy of the result in a race where both athletes recorded a time of 9.78 seconds. If SmartThings shot pourer from the 2012 Olympics were still around, it could once again fulfill its intended role of celebrating US medals.\nOmega, the Olympics official timekeeper for decades, has continually innovated to enhance performance measurement. The Omega Scan \u2018O\u2019 Vision Ultimate, the camera used for this photo finish, is a significant upgrade from its 10,000 frames per second predecessor. The new system captures four times as many frames per second and offers higher resolution, providing a detailed view of the moment each runners torso touches the finish line. This level of detail was crucial in determining that Lyles\u2019 torso touched the line first, securing his gold medal.\nThis camera is part of Omega\u2019s broader technological advancements for the Paris 2024 Olympics, which include advanced Computer Vision systems utilizing AI and high-definition cameras to track athletes in real-time.

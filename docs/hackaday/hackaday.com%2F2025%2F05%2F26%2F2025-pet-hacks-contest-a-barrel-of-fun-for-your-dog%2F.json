Its a story of uncertain provenance and may indeed be a myth, but that hasnt stopped [Saren Tasciyan] 3D printing one for their faithful hound. In its own way it too is a saviour, for as well as a small camera, it carries a supply of dog poop bags.\nIts a two part print, held together with strong magnets. Waterproofing is achieved using liberal quantities of hot glue. Theres a protrusion on one side designed to take an action camera for a dogs-eye-view of the world.

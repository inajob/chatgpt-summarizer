The team behind Asahi Linux has now brought us the only conformant OpenGL\u00ae, OpenCL, and Vulkan\u00ae drivers for Apples M1 and M2.\nThe emulation overhead of the system means that most games will need at least 16 GB of RAM to run. Many games are playable, but newer titles cant yet hit 60 frames per second. The developers are currently focused on correctness and hope to improve performance in future updates. Many indie titles are reported to already be working at full speed though.\nYou can hear more about some of the fiddly bits of how to tessellate with arcane compute shaders in the video below. Dont worry, its only 40 minutes of the nine hour video and it should start right at the presentation by GPU dev [Alyssa Rosenzweig].\nIf you want to see some of how Linux on Apple Silicon started or some of the previous work on hacking the M1 GPU, we have you covered.\n\n"}

It even has a speaker for sound!\nAll processing is done inside the keycap, which is a clever feat. There is a USB connection, but its only for power and keyboard controls, so its completely playable without needing a whole lot of external support. The custom PCB and code are based off an earlier RP2040 DOOM project, and [TheKeebProject] has certainly made it their own by managing to get everything so tightly integrated. Theres a quick video mashup embedded below. Theres still a bit of work to do, but the code and design files are all on GitHub should you wish for a closer look.\nMaking DOOM physically smaller is a good challenge, but wed like to remind fans that weve also seen DOOM shrink in terms of power consumption, all the way down to 1 mW.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Bob (@thekeebproject)\n\n\n"}

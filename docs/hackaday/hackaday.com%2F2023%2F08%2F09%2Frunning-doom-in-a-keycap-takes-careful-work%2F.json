It even has a speaker for sound!\nAll processing is done inside the keycap, which is a clever feat. There is a USB connection, but its only for power and keyboard controls, so its completely playable without needing a whole lot of external support. The custom PCB and code are based off an earlier RP2040 DOOM project, and [TheKeebProject] has certainly made it their own by managing to get everything so tightly integrated. Theres a quick video mashup embedded below. Theres still a bit of work to do, but the code and design files are all on GitHub should you wish for a closer look.\nMaking DOOM physically smaller is a good challenge, but wed like to remind fans that weve also seen DOOM shrink in terms of power consumption, all the way down to 1 mW.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Bob (@thekeebproject)\n\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3067DOOM\u3092\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3060", "body": "Raspberry Pi RP2040\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u3001DOOM\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3060\u3002USB\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u3068\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u307f\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306fGitHub\u306b\u516c\u958b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3067DOOM\u3092\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u3093\u3060", "\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0PCB\u3068\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30ec\u30b8\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4e2d\u306eDOOM", "\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd\u306aDOOM", "\u5185\u90e8\u3067\u51e6\u7406\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u308b\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4e2d\u306eDOOM", "\u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb\u91cf\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u305fDOOM\u306e\u7e2e\u5c0f\u7248"]}

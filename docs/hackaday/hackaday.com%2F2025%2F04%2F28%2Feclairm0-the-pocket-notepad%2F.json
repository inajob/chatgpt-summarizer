[Matt] sent in this beautifully documented pocket device that brings back great memories of texting on early cellphones.\nThe EclairM0s firmware is written in TinyGo, a language he hadn\u2019t used before but found perfect for a microcontroller project where storage space is tight. The 14-button input mimics early phone keypads, using multi-tapping and combo key presses to offer various functions. The small SSD1306 OLED display is another highlight. Building on an earlier CircuitPython project, [Matt] optimized the screen\u2019s performance, speeding up its response time for a snappy user experience. The battery picked was only 3 mm thick, however the protection circuity on the battery added another 2 mm so he moved that protection circuity to the main PCB itself to keep it as thin as initially planned.\nWeighing just 15 grams, this lightweight device runs on a SAMD21 microcontroller, which supports USB host functionality. This allows the EclairM0 to act as a keyboard, mouse, or even USB peripherals. Housed in a 3D-printed case, the entire project is open-source, with design and firmware files available on GitHub.\nWe love small handheld projects around here and this well-documented, fun pocket device is no exception, if you want your own he has a page dedicated to helping you build a EclairM0.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u643a\u5e2f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cEclairM0\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9EclairM0\u306f\u3001\u521d\u671f\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u611f\u899a\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u643a\u5e2f\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300cEclairM0\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- TinyGo\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30eb\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u521d\u671f\u643a\u5e2f\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f14\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u5165\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u8a2d\u8a08\u306eEclairM0", "- USB\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u8efd\u91cf\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

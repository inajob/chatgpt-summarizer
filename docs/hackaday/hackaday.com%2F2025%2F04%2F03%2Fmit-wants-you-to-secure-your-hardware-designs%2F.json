But MITs 6.5950 class teaches secure hardware design  how to attack and defend CPUs from bad actors. Interested? The course is open source, so you can follow along as long as you dont mind not getting a grade.\nBrowsing some of the lecture slides shows that the material isnt as stuffy as you might imagine. A slide about side channel attacks, for example, features an article called And Bomb the Anchovies, which says that Washington DC pizza places know when big news is about to break because pizza delivery to places like the White House or the Pentagon trend upward (something spies call pizza-int, by the way).\nEven if you dont have a burning desire to design more secure hardware, some of the lecture slides make for an interesting flip through on a rainy weekend day. For example, the charts about RowHammer (RowHammer in One Sentence) is a great explanation about how software can cause DRAM failures to attack a computer. We only wished theyd identified companies A, B, and C in their study. There are also labs and they politely clarify what setup you need to do each lab (typically, just a Linux server, although some you can do with just a browser).\nOne of the great things about the Internet is that you can virtually audit classes from anywhere in the world, often for free. MIT is always up to something interesting."}

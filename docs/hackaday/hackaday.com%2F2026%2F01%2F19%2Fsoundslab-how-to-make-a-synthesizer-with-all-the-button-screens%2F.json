As exemplified by devices with a UX that regularly degrades into scrolling through options on a tiny screen. This was basically the impetus for [Craig J Bishop] a few years ago to set out on a design project called the SoundSlab audio sequencer/sampler/synthesizer and slab that would make those buttons much more functional.\nObviously, the right way to start the project is to bulk buy hundreds of 0.85 128128 LCDs so that youre firmly locked into that choice. Fortunately, it turned out that the most annoying part of this LCD was the non-standard 0.7 mm pitch on its flat flex cable (FFC). This was worked around with an PCB adapter milled out of some copper-clad FR-1, which gave it a convenient PMOD interface for straightforward hook-up to a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA board.\nThe buttons themselves were designed as 3D printed key caps for the LCDs that clipped onto typical Cherry MX-style mechanical keys. This also revealed that the original FFCs were too short, so they had to be replaced with new FFCs, that also adapted it to a standard 0.5 mm pitch. With this a 44 button prototype board could be constructed for testing.\nSince that prototype [Craig] has built a full-sized SoundSlab grid, with a custom FPGA board and HDMI input, of which a preview can be seen in the post, along with a promise by [Craig] to soon post the rest of the SoundSlab development.\nThanks to [JohnS_AZ] for the tip.", "title": "- \u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306b\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u6a5f\u5668\u306b\u5c0f\u578b\u753b\u9762\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3001SoundSlab\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306b\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044UX\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3001SoundSlab\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u7279\u6b8a\u306aFFC\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3057\u305fLCD\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u5de5\u592b", "- Cherry MX\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u8a2d\u8a08", "- SoundSlab\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u5168\u5bb9\u3068\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u958b\u767a\u8a08\u753b"]}

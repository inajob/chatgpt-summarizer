Currently the filesystem is on its fourth major revision, in use since its release in 2008 thanks to its stability, reliability, and backwards compatibility with the other ext filesystem versions. But with that much history there are bound to be a few issues cropping up here and there. [Will] recently found an exploit with this filesystem that can cause a Linux kernel to immediately panic when a manipulated USB drive is inserted into a computer.\n[Will] discovered this quirk when investigating the intricacies of the filesystem for problems and other vulnerabilities. A tool called tune2fs, used for administering and modifying ext filesystems, includes the ability to pass certain commands to the Linux kernel when certain situations arise with the filesystem itself, including that the kernel should panic. One situation is that the ext filesystem itself becomes corrupted, which can then cause the kernel panic. Armed with this knowledge, a USB drive can be purposefully given a corrupted ext filesystem which, when plugged into a Linux machine, can cause the computer to shut down.\nThe post linked above goes into some discussion about how this exploit could be used maliciously to gain access to a Linux system, including rebooting computers where no access to a power button is otherwise enabled or making other changes to the system before needing a reboot to apply the changes. In general, though, its good to assume an attacker could take any route to gain access to a machine. This exploit from a few years ago, for example, allowed another Linux tool to be used to gain root access.\nThanks to [Timothy] for the tip!", "title": "**Linux\u306eext\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2**", "body": "ext\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u306f\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001USB\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30d1\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["**Linux\u306eext\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2**", "**USB\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306b\u3088\u308bLinux\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027**", "**ext\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u60aa\u7528\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3068\u306f\uff1f**", "**\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb\u30d1\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059USB\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u306e\u5371\u967a\u6027**", "**Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3078\u306e\u4e0d\u6b63\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u624b\u6cd5\u306e\u8003\u5bdf**"]}

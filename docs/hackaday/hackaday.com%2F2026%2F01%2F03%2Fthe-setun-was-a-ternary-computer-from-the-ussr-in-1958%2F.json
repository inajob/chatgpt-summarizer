The Setun, the worlds first ternary computer, was developed at Moscow State University in 1958. Its troubled and short-lived history is covered in the video. The machine itself uses trits (ternary digits) instead of bits (binary digits).\nWhen your digits have three discrete values there are a multiplicity of ways of assigning meaning to each state, and the Setun uses a system known as balanced ternary where each digit can be either -1, 0, or 1 and otherwise uses a place-value system in the normal way.\nAn interesting factoid that comes up in the video is that base-3 (also known as radix-3) is the maximally efficient way to represent numbers because three is the closest integer to the natural growth constant, the base of the natural logarithm, e, which is approximately 2.718 \u2248 3.\nIf youre interested to know more about ternary computing check out There Are 10 Kinds Of Computers In The World and Building The First Ternary Microprocessor.\n\n", "title": "\u7981\u3058\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300c\u30bb\u30c8\u30a5\u30f3\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "1958\u5e74\u306b\u30e2\u30b9\u30af\u30ef\u5927\u5b66\u3067\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e09\u9032\u6cd5\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfSetun\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u7981\u3058\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300c\u30bb\u30c8\u30a5\u30f3\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u6210\u529f\u3068\u632b\u6298\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6301\u3064\u521d\u306e\u4e09\u9032\u6cd5\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u4e09\u9032\u6570\uff08\u30c6\u30ca\u30ea\u30fc\uff09\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u6027\u3068\u305d\u306e\u610f\u5473", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u672a\u6765\u3092\u5909\u3048\u305f\u4e09\u5024\u8ad6\u7406\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u30c6\u30ca\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8996\u70b9\u306e\u767a\u898b"]}

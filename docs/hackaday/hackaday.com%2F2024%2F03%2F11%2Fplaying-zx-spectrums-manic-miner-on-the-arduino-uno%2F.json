For the video and audio output he created an add-on board for the Uno that creates a composite signal using two resistors, along with an audio driver circuit and control inputs either from the onboard buttons or from a NES controller. Audio can be sent either over the composite output or via the audio jack.\nA demonstration of the game is provided in a number of videos on [Scott]s YouTube account, which shows off a few levels, at 256256 resolution. It contains all 20 original levels, with a few quality of life upgrades with animation. It also features original music, which may or may not work for you, but music can be turned on or off in the main menu. Compared to the 3.5 MHz Z80 MPU in the ZX Spectrum, the 16 MHz AVR of the Uno is a lot beefier, which raises the hope that a color version like the ZX Spectrum one is also in the future, even if it may require an add-on board with a framebuffer. As [Scott] notes, the weakness of the Uno is that the ZX Spectrum has significantly more RAM, which limits what can be done.\nThanks to [256byteram] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "Arduino Uno\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u51fa\u529b\u30b7\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0  ", "body": "Arudino Uno\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u51fa\u529b\u30b7\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u5165\u529b\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002Manic Miner\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3082\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001ZX Spectrum\u5411\u3051\u306b\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3002\u30c7\u30e2\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u914d\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Arduino Uno\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u51fa\u529b\u30b7\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0  ", "8-bit AVR\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3067Manic Miner\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308bArduino Uno\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "NES\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5165\u529b\u3092\u542b\u3080Arduino Uno\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9  ", "ZX Spectrum\u5411\u3051\u306eManic Miner\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u79fb\u690d\u3057\u305fArduino Uno\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8  ", "Arduino Uno\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u51fa\u529b\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3"]}

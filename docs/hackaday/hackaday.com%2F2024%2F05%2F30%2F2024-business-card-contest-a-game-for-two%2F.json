After all, if they want to keep talking, thats a pretty good sign that even if you dont become business partners, you might end up friends. What better way to make an acquaintance than over a friendly game of tic-tac-toe?\nThis one will probably take them by surprise, being a 44 matrix rather than the usual 33, but that just makes it more interesting. The front of the card has all the usual details, and the back is a field of LEDs and micro switches. Instead of using X and O, [Edison Science Corner] is using colors  green for player one, and red for player two. Since playing requires the taking of turns, the microcontroller lights up green and red with alternating single-button presses.\nSpeaking of, the brains of this operation is an ATMega328P-AU programmed with Arduino. If youd like to make your own tic-tac-toe business card, the schematic, BOM, and code are all available. Be sure to check out the build and demo video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n"}

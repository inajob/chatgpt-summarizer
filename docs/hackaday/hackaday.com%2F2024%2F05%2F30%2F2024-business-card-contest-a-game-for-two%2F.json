After all, if they want to keep talking, thats a pretty good sign that even if you dont become business partners, you might end up friends. What better way to make an acquaintance than over a friendly game of tic-tac-toe?\nThis one will probably take them by surprise, being a 44 matrix rather than the usual 33, but that just makes it more interesting. The front of the card has all the usual details, and the back is a field of LEDs and micro switches. Instead of using X and O, [Edison Science Corner] is using colors  green for player one, and red for player two. Since playing requires the taking of turns, the microcontroller lights up green and red with alternating single-button presses.\nSpeaking of, the brains of this operation is an ATMega328P-AU programmed with Arduino. If youd like to make your own tic-tac-toe business card, the schematic, BOM, and code are all available. Be sure to check out the build and demo video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "body": "\u89aa\u3057\u304f\u306a\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u306f\u9577\u304f\u8a71\u3092\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u308c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u53cb\u9054\u306b\u306a\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002[Edison Science Corner]\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u300144\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30fc\u3067\u3001ATMega328P-AU\u304c\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3\u3084\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u89aa\u3057\u3044\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u7bc9\u304f\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "LED\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "Arduino\u3067\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3068\u30c7\u30e2\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0"]}

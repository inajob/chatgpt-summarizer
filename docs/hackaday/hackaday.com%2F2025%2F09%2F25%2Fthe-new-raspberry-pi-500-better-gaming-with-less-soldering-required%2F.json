This turned out to be the case, with [Jeff Geerling] now taking the new RPi 500+ to bits for some experimentation and keyboard modding.\nThe 500s case was not designed to be opened, but if you did, youd find that there was space allocated for a Power-Over-Ethernet section as well as an M.2 slot, albeit with all of the footprints unpopulated. Some hacking later and enterprising folk found that soldering the appropriate parts on the PCB does in fact enable a working M.2 slot. What the 500+ thus does is basically do that soldering work for you, while sadly not offering a PoE feature yet without some DIY soldering.\nPerhaps the most obvious change is the keyboard, which now uses short-travel mechanical switches  with RGB  inside an enclosure that is now fortunately easy to open, as you may want to put in a different NVMe drive at some point. Or, if youre someone like [Jeff] you want to use this slot to install an M.2 to Oculink adapter for some external GPU action.\nAfter some struggling with eGPU devices an AMD RX 7900 XT was put into action, with the AMD GPU drivers posing no challenge after a kernel recompile. Other than the Oculink cable preventing the case from closing and also losing the M.2 NVMe SSD option, it was a pretty useful mod to get some real gaming and LLM action going.\nWith the additions of a presoldered M.2 slot and a nicer keyboard, as well as 16 GB RAM, you have to decide whether the $200 asking price is worth it over the $90 RPi 500. In the case of [Jeff] his kids will have to make do with the RPi 500 for the foreseeable future, and the RPi 400 still finds regular use around his studio.\n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi 500+\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "RPi 500+\u306f\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f200\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306eRPi 500\u306e90\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u306e\u5dee\u306b\u60a9\u3080\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi 500+\u306e\u65b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- M.2\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u4ed8\u304d\u306eRPi 500+\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "- \u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u9032\u5316\uff01RPi 500+\u306e\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1", "- DIY\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01RPi 500+\u306eeGPU\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Raspberry Pi 500\u3068500+\u3001\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u306f\u3069\u3061\u3089\u306b\uff1f"]}

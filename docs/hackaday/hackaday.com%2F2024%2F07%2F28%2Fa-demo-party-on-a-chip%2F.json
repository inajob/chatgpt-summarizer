For all that though, theres a frontier it hasnt yet entirely conquered, which exists in the realm of silicon. To address this cones the ever awesome Tiny Tapeoput, who are bringing their ASIC-for-the-masses scheme to the world of demos with an ASIC demo competition.\nWith a closing date of 6th of September, all accepted entrants get a free Tiny Tapeout tile for their entry. Entries are limited to two tiles or less. with VGA and audio outputs via a specified PMOD pinout. There are a variety of categories including the expected best sound and best graphics, but among them were most interested by the mixed signal one that includes analogue circuitry.\nTiny Tapeout has been a particularly exciting project over the last couple of years, truly breaking new ground for the hardware hacker world. Since theyve just recently been able to start doing some analog design on the chips, were excited to see what people come up with for this competition, and we hope it will provide significant advancement to the art. In the best tradition of the demo scene, theyve even made an intro for the competition, which you can see below the break.\nWant to know what all the fuss is about? Start here!\n\n\nThanks [Inne] for the tip!"}

More care and attention has gone into the high-end capsule and its associated circuitry than the cheap one, but is it still possible to get good quality from something costing under a dollar? [Mubarak Basha] thinks so, and has designed a preamp circuit to get the best from a cheap electret capsule.\nThese capsules may be cheap, but with the addition of a low voltage supply, a resistor, and a capacitor, their internal FET delivers a decent enough input to many a project. To improve on that will need a bit of effort, and in this the preamp delivers by taking care to match impedance, impose a carefully chosen frequency response, and just the right gain to derive a line level output from the electrets level. Its hardly a complex circuit, but thats not always necessary.\nAs always in these situations, without appropriate test equipment its difficult to gauge quality. Wed say this though, if you make one of these and it falls short, you wont have spent much. Meanwhile if youre curious about electrets, heres our guide."}

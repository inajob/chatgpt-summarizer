You can also buy many replacement ones that are at least longer. But how good are they? [Learnelectronics] wanted to know, too, so he broke out his NanoVNA and found out that they were all bad, although some were worse than others. You can see the results in the  sometimes fuzzy  video below.\nOf course, bad is in the eye of the beholder and you probably suspected that most of them werent super great, but they do seem especially bad. So much so, that, at first, he suspected he was doing something wrong. The SWR was high all across the bands the antennas targeted.\n\nIt wont come as a surprise to find that making an antenna work at 2 meters and 70 centimeters probably isnt that easy. In addition, it is hard to imagine the little stubby antenna the size of your thumb could work well no matter what. Still, youd think at least the longer antennas would be a little better.\nHams have had SWR meters for years, of course. But it sure is handy to be able to connect an antenna and see its performance over a wide band of frequencies. Some of the antennas werent bad on the UHF band. That makes sense because the antenna is physically larger but at VHF the size didnt seem a big difference.\nHe even showed up a little real-world testing and, as you might predict, the test results did not lie. However, only the smallest antenna was totally unable to hit the local repeater.\nOf course, you can always make your own antenna. It doesnt have to take much.\n"}

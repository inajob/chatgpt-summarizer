If you have the resources to build it, though, its possible to replicate the professional approach with a selective laser melting (SLM) printer, such as the one [Travis Mitchell] built (this is a playlist of nine videos, but if you want to see the final results, the last video is embedded below).\nMost of the playlist shows the process of physically constructing the machine, with only the last two videos getting into testing. The heart of the printer is a 500 Watt fiber laser and a galvo scan head, which account for most of the cost of the final machine. The print chamber has to be purged of oxygen with shielding gas, so [Travis] minimized the volume to reduce the amount of argon needed. The scan head therefore isn\u2019t located in the chamber, but shines down into it through a window in the chambers roof. A set of repurposed industrial servo motors raises and lowers the two pistons which form the build plate and powder dispenser, and another servo drives the recoater blade which smooths on another layer of metal powder after each layer.\nAs with any 3D printer, getting good first-layer adhesion proved troublesome, since too much power caused the powder to melt and clump together, and too little could result in incomplete fusion. Making sure the laser was in focus improved things significantly, though heat management and consequent warping remained a challenge. The recoater blade was originally made out of printed plastic, with a silicone cord along the edge. Scraping along hot fused metal in the early tests damaged it, so [Travis] replaced it with a stainless steel blade, which gave much more consistent performance. The final results looked extremely promising, though [Travis] notes that there is still room for redesign and improvement.\nThis printer joins the\u00a0very few\u00a0other\u00a0DIY SLM machines\u00a0we\u2019ve seen, though there is an\u00a0amazingly broad\u00a0range of other\u00a0creative ideas\u00a0for homemade\u00a0metal printers, from\u00a0electrochemical printers\u00a0to those that use\u00a0precise powder placement.\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u91d1\u5c5e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "body": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u7528\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3057\u3084\u3059\u30443D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3067\u3001Travis Mitchell\u304c\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305fSLM\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u5411\u3051\u91d1\u5c5e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe", "- Travis Mitchell\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u9078\u629e\u7684\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6eb6\u878d\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc", "- \u9ad8\u6027\u80fd3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u8ab2\u984c", "- \u91d1\u5c5e\u7c89\u672b\u306e\u63a5\u7740\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4", "- DIY\u3067\u306e\u91d1\u5c5e\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

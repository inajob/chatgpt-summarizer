For ages now, our rodent friends haven\u2019t been able to play the 1993 masterpiece, but [Viktor T\u00f3th] and colleagues have been working hard to fix this unfortunate oversight.\nIf youve got the feeling this isnt the first time youve read about rats attempting to slay demons, its probably because [Victor] has been working on this mission for years now  with a previous attempt succeeding in allowing rats to navigate the DOOM landscape. Getting the rodents to actually play through the game properly has proved slightly more difficult, however.\n\nImproving on the previous attempt, V2 has the capability to allow rats to traverse through levels, be immersed in the virtual world with a panoramic screen, and take out enemies. Rewards are given to successful behaviors in the form of sugar water through a solenoid powered dispenser.\nWhile this current system looks promising, the rats havent gotten too far though the game due to time constraints. But theyve managed to travel through the levels and shoot, which is still pretty impressive for rodents.\nDOOM has been an indicator of just how far we can take technology for decades. While this particular project has taken the meme into a slightly different direction, there are always surprises. You can even play DOOM in KiCad when you\u2019re tired of using it to design PCBs."}

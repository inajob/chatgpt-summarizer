Enter his new 3D-printed wind tunnel.\nAfter several prototypes, [AdamEnt] decided on a design that exploits slicer infill to create a flow straightener without having to do any tedious modeling of a lattice. Combined with a box on both ends of the straightener to constrain the flow, he has a more controllable air source with laminar instead of turbulent flow for testing his wind turbines.\nThe BLDC motor driving the air is attached to a toroidal blade of MIT fame. We get a little bit of the math behind calculating wind turbine efficiency and see a quick test of a blade placed next to the outlet of the air source at the end of the video.\nIf youre planning on building your own wind tunnel, weve covered a few. Weve even seen one that goes up to Mach 20, although that probably wouldnt be useful for wind turbine design!\n\n"}

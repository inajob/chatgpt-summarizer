Particularly if theyve got a creative mechanism that we havent seen before. This fine timepiece from [gooikerjh] fits the bill precisely\u2014its a sliding tile clock!\nThe brains of the build is an Arduino Nano ESP32. No, thats not a typo. Its basically an ESP32 in a Nano-like form factor. It relies on its in-built WiFi hardware to connect to the internet and synchronize itself with time servers so that its always showing accurate time. The ESP32 is set up to control a set of four stepper motors with a ULN2003 IC, and they run the neat time display mechanism.\nAll the custom parts are 3D printed, and the sliding tile concept is simple enough. There are four digits that show the time. Each digit contains number tiles that slide into place as the digit rotates. To increment the digit by one, it simply needs to be rotated 180 degrees by the relevant stepper motor, and the next number tile will slide into place.\nWe love a good clock at Hackaday\u2014the more mechanical, the better.

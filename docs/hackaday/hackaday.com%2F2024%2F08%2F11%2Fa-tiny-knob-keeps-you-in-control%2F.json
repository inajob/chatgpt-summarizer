When it comes to peripherals its not the size that matters, as proven by\u00a0 [Stefan Wagner] with the Tiny Knob. Its a very small PCB with a rotary encoder and knob, an ATtiny85, a USB port, and not much else.\nIt uses the V-USB software implementation of USB HID, and should you have a need for a Tiny Knob of your own you can find all the files for it in a GitHub repository. Theres even a very professional-looking 3D-printed enclosure for the finishing touch. We like this project for its simplicity, and we think you might too.\nOver the years weve brought you more than one knob, they appear to be a popular subject for experimentation. If youre up for more, have a look at this one."}

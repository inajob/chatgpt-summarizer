The kids-sized gangsters in that movie got around in kid-sized pedal cars. Apparently kid-sized [Tim] just loved the idea, but just didnt have the skills or tools to try to build one. But the time has come, and he has spent years putting together a workshop, tools, and skills.\nThe goal is a 4-wheeled vehicle that can actually be enclosed, to keep the driver out of the rain. It would be petal powered, with an optional electric assist. It should be made of simple materials, like plywood and epoxy. The design would be freely shared, and the overall cost hopefully kept low. Come back after the link to find the rest of the story, including the monkey wrench thrown into the works.\n\nThe design has slowly come together, starting with experiments around suspension. The first iteration was a beam front axle, pivoting in the center. That idea works great for tractors, but a pedal car needs some real independent suspension. And for springs and dampers, hes tried using hay tines, bed slats, tennis balls and bungee cords.\nThe whole project is all about making something good on a shoestring budget. There are some pedal cars being made around the world, but they arent particularly affordable, and havent arrived in some of the out of the way places like Western Ireland. The plan was to make a design that counted as an electric bike.\nUnfortunately, the European Union regulations around vehicles just dont account for a 4-wheel e-bike. If the whole thing could weigh in under 25 kilograms, it would count as a scooter, but thats not really an achievable weight limit. An e-bike is only allowed a maximum of three wheels. There is a classification that sounds promising, the Light Quadricycle, but that class is up to 425 kilograms, and nothing about being pedal powered.\nThe latest video in the series is an open letter to Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Transport of Ireland. A ruling to put this little prototype car back into a fitting category, or to define an ultralight quadricycle, would go a long ways toward making it a reality. But for now, knowing how slow the government wheels of change can be, [Tim] and his crew are working on making a 3-wheel version thats actually safe to drive. We wish him them the best of luck, and will be watching for the end product!\n", "title": "\u300c\u30d0\u30b0\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30de\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3001\u6728\u88fd\u306e\u30da\u30c0\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01\u300d", "body": "YouTuber Tim is building a wooden pedal car inspired by Bugsy Malone.

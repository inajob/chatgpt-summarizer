Experienced hams might have radios that cost thousands of dollars, with huge, steerable antennas on masts that can be similarly priced. But theres also a side to the hobby that throws all of this out of the window in favor of the simplest, lowest-cost radios and antennas that still can get the job done. Software-defined radio (SDR) turned this practice up to 11 as well, and this radio module uses almost nothing more than a microcontroller to get on the air.\nThe design uses the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico to handle almost all of the radios capabilities. The RF oscillator is driven by one of the Picos programmable I/O (PIO) pins, which takes some load off of the processor. For AM and SSB, where amplitude needs to be controlled as well, a PWM signal is generated on another PIO which is then mixed with the RF oscillator using an analog multiplexer. The design also includes a microphone with a preamplifier which can be fed into a third PIO; alternatively it can receive audio from a computer via the USB interface. More processor resources are needed when generating phase-modulated signals like RF, but the Pico is still quite capable of doing all of these tasks without jitter larger than a clock cycle.\nOf course this only outputs a signal with a few milliwatts of power, so for making any useful radio contacts with this circuit an amplifier is almost certainly needed. With the heavy lifting done by the Pico, though, the amplifier doesnt need to be complicated or expensive. While the design is simple and low-cost, its not the simplest radio possible. This transmitter sends out radio waves using only a single transistor but you will be limited to Morse code only.\n\n", "title": "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30d4\u30b3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f", "body": "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u8da3\u5473\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001SDR\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u51fa\u529b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5358\u7d14\u3067\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u307f\u306b\u9650\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u30d4\u30b3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u9001\u4fe1\u6a5f\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u3067\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u9001\u4fe1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

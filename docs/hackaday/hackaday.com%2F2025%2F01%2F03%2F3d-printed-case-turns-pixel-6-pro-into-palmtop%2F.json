Realistically most consumers were probably satisfied enough with smartphones as they became more widely available, but those of us who would prefer a real keyboard on our mobile devices are still feeling the pain. Today there are still a few commercial palmtop-like machines out there, but they arent exactly mainstream.\nWhich is why this 3D printed case for the Pixel 6 Pro from [TypingCat] is so interesting. It takes a relatively popular and capable contemporary phone, pairs it with a physical keyboard, and manages to create something that looks quite practical. Thanks to Termux, you can even get a fairly usable Linux environment going on the thing.\nThere arent too many components at play here, but still, we appreciate the fact that [TypingCat] provided links for not only the specific Bluetooth keyboard used, but the fasteners required to hold the three printed parts together. A link is also provided to the Termux-Desktops project, which allows you to get a Linux X11 desktop environment running on Android. Its not the pocket Linux computer of our dreams, but its pretty close.\nWhile the Pixel 6 Pro is a solid enough choice to base this project around, were interested in seeing if the community will come up with variants of this case to hold other similarly sized phones. Its interesting to note that [TypingCat] has decided to use the No Derivatives variant of the Creative Commons license for the bottom half of the case. But since the top half is a remix of an existing Pixel 6 Pro case from [JoshCraft3D], it carries a more permissive license and must be distributed separately. Long story short, folks can create and distribute custom versions of the phone-side of this case, but the bottom needs to remain the same.\nIf youve got filament to burn extrude and would rather have a more pure Linux experience, we saw a printable Raspberry Pi Zero palmtop a couple months back that looked quite promising.", "title": "\u300cPixel 6 Pro\u7528\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "body": "\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306f\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001Pixel 6 Pro\u7528\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cPixel 6 Pro\u7528\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u300d", "\u300cTermux\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u306eLinux\u74b0\u5883\u69cb\u7bc9\u300d", "\u300cBluetooth\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u5165\u529b\u306e\u60a9\u307f\u300d", "\u300c\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3001\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi Zero\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d"]}

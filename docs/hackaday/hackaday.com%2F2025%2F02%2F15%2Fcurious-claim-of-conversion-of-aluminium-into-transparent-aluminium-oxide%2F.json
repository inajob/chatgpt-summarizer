Such is the case with a recent publication in the Langmuir journal by [Budlayan] and colleagues titled\u00a0Droplet-Scale Conversion of Aluminum into Transparent Aluminum Oxide by Low-Voltage Anodization in an Electrowetting System.\nBreaking down the claims made and putting them alongside the PR piece on the [Ateneo De Manila] university site, we start off with a material called transparent aluminium oxide (TAlOx), which only brings to mind aluminium oxynitride, a material which we have covered previously. Aluminium oxynitride is a ceramic consisting of aluminium, oxygen and nitrogen thats created in a rather elaborate process with high pressures.\nIn the paper, however, we are talking about a localized conversion of regular aluminium metal into transparent aluminium oxide under the influence of the anodization process. The electrowetting element simply means overcoming the surface tension of the liquid acid and does not otherwise matter. Effectively this process would create local spots of more aluminium oxide, which is probably good for something?\nCombined with the rather suspicious artefacts in the summary image raising so many red flags that rather than the cool breakthrough folder well be filing this one under spat out by ChatGPT instead, not unlike a certain rat-centric paper that made the rounds about a year ago."}

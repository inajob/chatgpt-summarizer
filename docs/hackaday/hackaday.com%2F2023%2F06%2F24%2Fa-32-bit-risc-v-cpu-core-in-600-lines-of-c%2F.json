There are many different possible flavors of RISC-V, and in this case is a 32-bit base integer instruction set (RV32I), with multiplication and division extension (M), and compressed instruction set extension (C).\nTheres a full instruction list and examples of use on the GitHub repository. As for readers wondering what something like RISC-V emulation might be good for, it happens to be the not-so-secret sauce to running Linux on an RP2040."}

Old hat. Running Doom (2016) on an ARM SBC? Well, thats a bit more interesting, and [Interfacing Linux] shows us how with this handy guide, and in a video embedded below.\nThe ARM SBC in question is the Radxa Orion O6, which claims to be the worlds first open source ARMv9 motherboard. It has a 12-core ARM9.2 SoC from Cix, and crucially for gaming, a PCIe x16 slot to fit a graphics card. Theres onboard graphics in the SoC, of course, but thats only going to cut it for old DOOM, not Doom (2016).\nObviously there is no ARMv9 build of this nine-year-old classic. Thus, a certain degree of hacking is required. An x86 emulation layer called FEX is used to run Steam, which includes the Proton compatibility layer to sit between the Linux system and the Windows system calls the games are making.\nSo, again: Windows games, running via a compatibility layer on a Linux system running on an x86 emulator, running on another Linux system, running on ARM hardware. Yeah, wed call that a hack, and just possibly cursed. The amazing thing is that it works. As long as you use a PCI 3.0 graphics card, anyway; apparently newer ones dont work, or at least not the one [Interfacing Linux] had to try. (Some report better luck with newer NVIDIA cards.) Which is a pity, because every game tested is GPU-throttled on this system. Considering the CPU should be handling all the emulation, that just goes to show how GPU-heavy even 10-year-old games are.\n[Interfacing Linux] seems to enjoy running things where they should not; we just wrote up their SteamOS console.\nThis isnt the first time a Radxa board has shown up on Hackaday either, but they dont seem to be nearly as popular as the fruit-flavoured competition for the sort of projects we usually see. If youve got a good project using one of these powerful ARM boards or anything else, dont hesitate to send us a tip!\n\n\n"}

So often the multimeter has to come out to check, but its annoying. Thus we rather like [Mike]s Resistorganizer, which automates the process of keeping track of the components.\nAt its heart is a fairly simple concept, with the microcontroller reading the value of a resistor by measuring the voltage from a potential divider. The Resistorganizer extends this using an array of analogue multiplexer chips, and is designed to plug into one side of a breadboard with the idea being that each line can have a resistor connected to earth through it. Of course its not quite as simple as that, because to maintain a readable range a set of resistors must be switched in and out to form the other half of the divider for different ranges. Thus another multiplexer chip performs that task.\nFinally a set of digital multiplexers handles an LED to see which of the many resistors is currently selected through a pair of buttons, and a dot-matrix LCD display delivers the value. We want one already!", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "body": "\u300cResistorganizer\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u88c5\u7f6e\u306f\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30df\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u96fb\u5727\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u5024\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u9078\u629e\u3001\u8868\u793a\u306b\u306f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3001LED\u3068\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9LCD\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u5024\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u591a\u6570\u306e\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u3092\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308bLED\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "\u30d7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3068\u8868\u793a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u9078\u629e\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u62b5\u6297\u5668\u306e\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7bc4\u56f2"]}

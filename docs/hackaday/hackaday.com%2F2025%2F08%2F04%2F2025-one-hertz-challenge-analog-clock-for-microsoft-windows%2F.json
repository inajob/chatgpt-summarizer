There is no final clock, yet. But a number of yaks have been shaved. For instance, we have code for computing geometric objects without using branch instructions, including points and lines and circles and such.\nThe notes dive deep into various rabbit holes. At one point we find ourselves computing the angle to the sun in the sky, that we may be able to cast the shadow of the clock hands on our clock face. The notes include miscellaneous source code snippets and various screenshots of geometric renderings which have been achieved so far.\n\nWe thought it was fun that the geometric software references Euclids Elements, which, as you probably know, is the famous geometry book from Ancient Greece, the second most published book of all time, second only to the Bible.\nIf youre interested in analog clocks you might like this one which displays the date, not the time or this one which uses colors instead of hands.\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aWindows\u7528\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u884c\u72b6\u6cc1", "body": "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u3067\u3001\u5e7e\u4f55\u5b66\u8a08\u7b97\u3092\u884c\u3046\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1aWindows\u7528\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9032\u884c\u72b6\u6cc1", "- \u5e7e\u4f55\u5b66\u7684\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u306a\u3057\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u6642\u8a08\u306e\u91dd\u306e\u5f71\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u592a\u967d\u306e\u89d2\u5ea6\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b", "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u539f\u8ad6\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5e7e\u4f55\u5b66\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u65e5\u4ed8\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3068\u30ab\u30e9\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

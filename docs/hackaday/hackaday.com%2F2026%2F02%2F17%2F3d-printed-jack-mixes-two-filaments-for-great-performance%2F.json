With that said, [Alan Reiner] had great success with a simple idea to create a surprisingly capable scissor jack with a multi-material print.\nThe design will look familiar if youve ever pulled the standard jack out of the back of your car. However, this one isnt made fully out of steel. It relies on an M6 bolt and a rivet nut, but everything else is pure plastic. In this scissor jack design, rigid PETG arms are held in a scissor jack shape with a flexible TPU outer layer. Combined with the screw mechanism, its capable of delivering up to 400 pounds of force without failing. Its an impressive figure for something made out of 80 grams of plastic. The idea came about because of [Alans] recent build of a RatRig VCore4 printer, which has independent dual extruders. This allowed the creation of single prints with both rigid and flexible filaments included.\n[Alan] did test the jack by lifting up his vehicle, which it\u00a0kind\u00a0of achieved. The biggest problem was the short stroke length, which meant it could only raise the back of the car by a couple inches. Printing a larger version could make it a lot more practical for actual use if youre willing to trust a 3D-printed device in such use.\nFiles are on Printables if you wish to make your own. Its worth paying attention to the warning upfront that [Alan] provides\u2014THIS CAN CREATE A LOT OF FORCE (400+ lbs!), WHICH MEANS IT CAN STORE A LOT OF ENERGY THAT MIGHT BE RELEASED SUDDENLY.\u00a0 Please be cautious using 3d-printed objects for high loads and wear appropriate safety equipment!\nFunnily enough, weve featured 3D printed jacks before, all the way back in 2015! Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30b9\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001400\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u529b\u3092\u767a\u63ee\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30b9\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u30c1\u30c3\u30af\u88fd\u30b9\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u529b\uff1a400\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u6301\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u308b", "- \u591a\u7d20\u6750\u5370\u5237\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u9811\u4e08\u306a\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u81ea\u4f5c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u5b89\u5168\u5bfe\u7b56", "- \u5b9f\u7528\u6027\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u306e\u6539\u826f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

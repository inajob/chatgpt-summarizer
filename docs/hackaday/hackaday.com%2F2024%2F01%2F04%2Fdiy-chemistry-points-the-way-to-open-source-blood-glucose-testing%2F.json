From insulin to alcohol wipes, diabetes is a resource-intensive disease, and running out of anything has the potential for disaster. This is especially true for glucose test trips, the little electrochemical dongles that plug into a meter and read the amount of glucose in a single drop of blood.\nAs you might expect, glucose test strips are highly proprietary, tightly regulated, and very expensive. But the chemistry that makes them work is pretty simple, which led [Markus Bindhammer] to these experiments with open source glucose testing. Its all part of a larger effort at developing an open Arduino glucometer, a project that has been going on since 2016 but stalled in part thanks to supply chain difficulties on the chemistry side, mainly in procuring glucose oxidase, an enzyme that oxidizes glucose. The reaction creates hydrogen peroxide, which can be measured to determine the amount of glucose present.\nWith glucose oxidase once again readily available  from bakery and wine-making suppliers  [Markus] started playing with the chemistry. The first reaction in the video below demonstrates how iodine and starch can be used as a reagent to detect peroxide. A tiny drop of glucose solution turns the iodine-starch suspension a deep blue color in the presence of glucose oxidase.\nWhile lovely, colorimetric reactions such as these arent optimal for analyzing blood, so reaction number two uses electrochemistry to detect glucose. Platinum electrodes are bathed in a solution of glucose oxidase and connected to a multimeter. When glucose is added to the solution, the peroxide produced lowers the resistance across the electrodes. This is essentially whats going on in commercial glucose test strips, as well as in continuous glucose monitors.\nHats off to [Markus] for working so diligently on this project. Were keenly interested in this project, and well be following developments closely.\n", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "body": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u306f\u3001\u8840\u7cd6\u5024\u6e2c\u5b9a\u7528\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u5927\u5909\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ed\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30a8\u30bf\u30ea\u3067\u898f\u5236\u304c\u53b3\u3057\u304f\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3053\u3067\u3001\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u9178\u5316\u9175\u7d20\u306e\u8abf\u9054\u96e3\u3067\u958b\u767a\u304c\u505c\u6ede\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u8840\u7cd6\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u3001\u30d1\u30f3\u5c4b\u3084\u30ef\u30a4\u30f3\u88fd\u9020\u696d\u8005\u304b\u3089\u8abf\u9054\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7269\u8cea\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8272\u7d20\u53cd\u5fdc\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5fdc\u304c\u7528\u3044\u3089\u308c\u3001\u5546\u7528\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u9023\u7d9a\u8840\u7cd6\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30ce\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306e\u8a66\u307f", "\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u98df\u54c1\u696d\u754c\u304b\u3089\u53d6\u308a\u5bc4\u305b\u305f\u9175\u7d20\u3067\u30b0\u30eb\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u5b9f\u9a13", "\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b1\u30df\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8840\u6db2\u5206\u6790\u306e\u7814\u7a76"]}

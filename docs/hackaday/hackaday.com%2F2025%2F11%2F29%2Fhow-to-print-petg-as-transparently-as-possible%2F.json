You can even get translucent or transparent forms if you want to print something vaguely see-through. But if youre looking for a bit more visually impressive, you might like to pick up a few tips from [Tej Grewal] on making sure your prints come out as clear as possible.\nStandard print settings arent great for transparency.\nIt all comes down to pathing of the 3D printers hot end. If its zigzagging back and forth, laying down hot plastic in all different orientations from layer to layer, youre going to get a hazy, ugly, result that probably doesnt look very see-through at all.\nHowever, you can work around this by choosing slicer settings that make the tool pathing more suitable for producing a clearer part. [Tej] recommends going slow  as little as 20 mm/s during printing. He also states that removing top and bottom shells and setting wall loops to 1 can help to produce a part thats entirely infill. Then, youll want to set infill to 100% and the direction to 0 or 90 degrees. This will ensure your hot end is just making long, straight strokes for layer after layer that will best allow light to pass through. Youll also want to maximize nozzle flow to avoid any unsightly gaps or bubbles in your print.\n[Tej] demonstrates the technique by creating a cover for a display. By using the settings in question, he creates a far more transparent plate, compared to the original part that has an ugly zig-zagging haze effect. Youre not going to get something optically clear this way; the final results are more lightly frosted, but still good.\nTransparency will never be something 3D printers are\u00a0great\u00a0at. However, we have seen some interesting post-processing techniques that will blow your mind in this regard."}

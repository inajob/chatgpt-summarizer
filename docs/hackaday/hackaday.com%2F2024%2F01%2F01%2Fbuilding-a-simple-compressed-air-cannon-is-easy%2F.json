You dont need any of that chemical nonsense to just have fun, though, as this compressed air cannon from [OtisLiu153] demonstrates.\nThe build uses PVC pipes for both the barrel and the air tank. In the case of the latter, avoiding over-pressurization is key to avoiding injury, though some will say you should simply never build a PVC pipe pressure vessel at all. In this case, [OtisLiu153] strictly recommends 150 psi as a limit, which is nicely within the 280 PSI rating of the 2 Schedule 40 PVC being used. Though, as they note, the connections in the design arent necessarily up to the same rating.\nOff-the-shelf couplings are used to piece everything together, with the twin-reservoir design also acting as a useful shoulder mount. Charging the cannon is done via a Schrader valve, as you might find on a bikes inner tube, and firing is achieved via a ball valve.\nOf course, if you build such an air cannon yourself, just be careful with your aim.

Here PumpkinOS is a PalmOS-compatible project by [migueletto] which runs as a regular application on modern systems and allows for\u00a0 original PalmOS applications for the Motorola 68k to run on x86 and ARM host systems.\nOn start-up the Launcher shows up first, just like with PalmOS, from which the four standard PalmOS applications (AddressBook, MemoPad, ToDoList and DateBook) can be launched. Due to endianness issues (m68k being Big Endian), files created by these applications cannot be shared between PumpkinOS and PalmOS, and as noted on the GitHub page, its still a far from finished project. That said, it appears to be able to run quite a few original PalmOS applications from sites like PalmDB, and compatibility should get better over time.\nThe author maintains a development blog as well, for those who are interested in the more in-depth details of this project.", "title": "\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0OS\u4e92\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aPumpkinOS", "body": "PumpkinOS\u306fPalmOS\u4e92\u63db\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u6700\u521d\u306b\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u30014\u3064\u306e\u6a19\u6e96\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002Still in progress.\u5143\u306ePalmOS\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3067\u304d\u3001\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306f\u6642\u9593\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0OS\u4e92\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aPumpkinOS", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\uff1aPumpkinOS\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5411\u3051PalmOS\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "m68k\u304b\u3089x86\u3084ARM\u3078\uff1aPumpkinOS\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebPalmOS\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3067\u8d77\u52d5\uff1aPumpkinOS\u3067\u306ePalmOS\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5b9f\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u4e92\u63db\u6027\uff1aPumpkinOS\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebPalmOS\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u884c"]}

But sometimes, we stumble upon a hack from the past so compelling that weve got to bring it to you, so we can all marvel at what was possible in the Before Times.\nThis one, a completely homebrewed automatic photometric telescope, was designed and built by the father-son team of [Jack Ells] and [Peter Ells]. From the elder [Ells] field notes, the telescope saw its first light in 1988, giving us some idea of the scale of problems that had to be overcome to get this wonderful machine working. The optics are straightforward, as least as telescopes go  its an f-4.0 Newtonian reflector with an 8.5 (221 mm) primary mirror on an equatorial mount. The telescope is very rugged-looking indeed, and even stands on brick piers for stability. The telescopes mount is controlled by a BBC Micro running custom BASIC software.\nFor the photometric parts, the [Ells] boys installed a photo-multiplier tube at the focus of the telescope. More precisely, they used a liquid light guide to connect the eyepiece to a rack full of equipment, which included the PM tube, its high-voltage power supply, and a series of signal conditioners and counter circuits. The idea was to view a single star through a pinhole mask over the objective of the telescope and count the rate of photons received over time. Doing so would reveal periodic changes in the stars brightness. Today wed use similar data to search for exoplanet transits; while we dont think that was a thing back in 1988, it looks like this telescope could easily have handled the job.\nSadly, [Jack Ells] died only two years after finishing the telescope. But he left it with his son, who eventually moved it to a location with better seeing conditions, where it gathered data for another eight years. The quality of the work is amazing, and as father-son projects go, this one is tough to beat.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u671b\u9060\u93e1\uff1a1988\u5e74\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30c7\u30a4\u3067\u306f\u3001\u65b0\u9bae\u306a\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7236\u5b50\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u6e2c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306f\u30011988\u5e74\u306b\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u30018\u5e74\u9593\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7236\u89aa\u306f\u5b8c\u6210\u5f8c2\u5e74\u3067\u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u606f\u5b50\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u7d99\u304e\u3001\u512a\u308c\u305f\u6210\u679c\u3092\u6b8b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u671b\u9060\u93e1\uff1a1988\u5e74\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "BBC Micro\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\uff1a\u7236\u5b50\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u671b\u9060\u93e1", "\u661f\u306e\u660e\u308b\u3055\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\uff1a1988\u5e74\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6", "\u7236\u304b\u3089\u606f\u5b50\u3078\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u907a\u7523", "\u661f\u306e\u5468\u671f\u7684\u5909\u5316\uff1a1988\u5e74\u306e\u5149\u5ea6\u8a08\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

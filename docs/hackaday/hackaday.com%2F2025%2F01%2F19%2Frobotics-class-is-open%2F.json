But thats wasteful if you are trying to do anything serious. Take a robot, for example. Are you using ROS (Robot Operating System)? If not  or even if you are  check out [Janne Karttunene] and the University of Eastern Finlands open-source course Robotics and ROS 2 Essentials.\nThe material is on GitHub. Rather than paraphrase, heres the description from the course itself:\nThis course is designed to give you hands-on experience with the basics of robotics using ROS 2 and Gazebo simulation. The exercises focus on the Andino robot from Ekumen and are structured to gradually introduce you to ROS 2 and Docker.\nNo prior experience with ROS 2 or Docker is needed, and since everything runs through Docker, you won\u2019t need to install ROS 2 on your system beforehand. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn essential concepts like autonomous navigation and mapping for mobile robots. All the practical coding exercises are done in Python.\nTopics include SLAM, autonomous navigation, odometry, and path planning. It looks like it will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in robotics or anything else you might do with ROS.\nIf you want a quick introduction to ROS, we can help. Weve seen a number of cool ROS projects over the years."}

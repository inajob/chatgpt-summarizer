However, he wanted to improve its ability to pick things up, and attaching a pneumatic gripper seemed like the perfect way to achieve that. Thus began the build!\nThe concept of [Tazer]s pneumatic gripper is simple enough. When the pliable silicone gripper is filled with air, the back half is free to expand, while the inner section is limited in its expansion thanks to fabric included in the structure. This causes the gripper to deform in such a way that it folds around as it fills with air, which lets it pick up objects. [Tazer] designed the gripper so that that could be cast in silicone using 3D printed molds. Its paired with a 3D printed manifold which delivers air to open and close the gripper as needed. Mounted on the end of [Tazer]s robotic arm, its capable of lifting small objects quite well.\nIts a fun build, particularly for the lovely sounds of silicone parts being ripped out of their 3D printed molds. Proper ASMR grade stuff, here. Weve also seen some other great work on pneumatic robot grippers over the years.\n\n"}

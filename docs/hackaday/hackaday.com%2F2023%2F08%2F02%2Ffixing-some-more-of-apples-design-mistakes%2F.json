[Ken Pillonel] is back for another round of fixing Apples repairability mistakes with a full complement of 3D printable replacement parts for the AirPods Pro case.\nWhile modeling all of the parts would be handy enough for repairing a device with a 0/10 iFixit score, [Pillonel] modified the parts to go together with screws instead of adhesive so any future repairs dont require cracking the plastic egg. He says, By showcasing the potential for repairability, I hope to inspire both consumers and multi-billion dollar companies, like Apple, to embrace sustainable practices in their products.\n[Pillonel]s repairability exploits may seem familiar to readers from his previous work on adding USB-C to the iPhone and the AirPods Pro case. If you just need to retrieve a lost AirPod, you might try an electromagnet, or you can make a Bluetooth receiver from a pair of knock-off buds.\n\n"}

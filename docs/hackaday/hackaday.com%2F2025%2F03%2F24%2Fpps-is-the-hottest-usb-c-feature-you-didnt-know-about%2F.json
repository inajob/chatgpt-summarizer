Its become relatively standard, and is a popular way for makers to easily power their projects at a number of specific, useful voltages. However, what you may not know is that its possible to get much more variable voltages out of some USB chargers out there. As [GreatScott!] explains, youll want to meet USB-C PPS.\nPPS stands for Programmable Power Supply. Its a method by which a USB-C device can request variable voltage and current delivery on demand. Unlike the Power Delivery standard, youre not limited to set voltages at tiers of 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V. You can have your device request the exact voltage it wants, right from the charger.\u00a0 Commercially, its most typically used to allow smartphones to charge as fast as possible by getting the optimum voltage to plumb into the battery. However, with the right techniques, you can use PPS to get a charger to output whatever voltage\u00a0you want, from 3.3 V to 21 V, for your own nefarious purposes. You can choose a voltage in 20 mV increments, and even set a current limit in 50 mA increments. Dont go mad with power, now.\nHowever, theres a hitch. Unlike USB PD, there isnt yet a whole ecosystem of $2 PPS breakout boards ready to gloop into your own little projects. As [GreatScott!] suggests, if you want to use PPS, you might want to take a look at the AP33772S IC. Its a USB PD3.1 Sink Controller. You can command it over I2C to ask for the voltage and current you want. If thats too hard, though, [CentyLab] has a solution on Tindie to get you going faster. Its also got some exciting additional functionality\u2014like USB-C AVS support. It offers higher voltage and more power, albeit with less resolution, but chargers with this functionality are quite obscure at this stage.\nWeve actually touched on PPS capability before in our exploration of the magic that is USB-C Power Delivery. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Keith Olson for the tip!]"}

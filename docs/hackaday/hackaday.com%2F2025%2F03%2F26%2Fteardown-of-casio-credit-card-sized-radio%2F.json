Things were quite different back in the 1980s, with the idea of a credit card-sized radio almost preposterous. This didnt stop the engineers over at Casio from having a go at this and many other nutty ideas, with [Matt] from Techmoan having a go at taking one of these miniaturized marvels apart.\nThe Casio FM Stereo radio in happier days. (Credit: Techmoan, YouTube)\nOn the chopping block is the FM stereo device that was featured in a previous episode. Out of the four credit card-sized radios in that video, the one with the rechargeable battery (obviously) had ceased to work, so it was the obvious choice for a teardown. This mostly meant peeling off the glued-on top and bottom, after which the circuitry became visible.\nIn addition to the battery with a heavily corroded contact, the thin PCB contains a grand total of three ICs in addition to the analog circuitry. These were identified by [Spritetm] as an AM/FM tuner system IC (TA7792), an FM PLL MPX (TA7766AF) and a headphone amplifier (TA7767F), all of them manufactured by Toshiba.\nAlthough [Matt] reckons this was a destructive teardown, were looking forward to the repair video where a fresh cell is soldered in and the case glued back together.\n", "title": "\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u306b\u306fToshiba\u88fd\u306eIC\u304c3\u3064\u3002\u4fee\u7406\u52d5\u753b\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u96fb\u5b50\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "\u30ab\u30b7\u30aa\u306eFM\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3092\u5206\u89e3\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f", "\u5408\u8a083\u3064\u306eIC\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305f\u8584\u578bPCB\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "\u8150\u98df\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u63a5\u70b9\u3092\u767a\u898b\uff01\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u6e96\u5099", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

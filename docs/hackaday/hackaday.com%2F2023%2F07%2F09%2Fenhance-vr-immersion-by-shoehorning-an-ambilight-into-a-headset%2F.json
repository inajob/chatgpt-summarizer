The RGB lighting would create a sort of ambient halo of color around the screen, but the kicker was that the colors were chosen to match what was happening on-screen, giving the impression that the screen content was spilling out into the surrounding area.\nIt was a neat effect that spawned remakes and improvements, and one day someone got the idea to combine the concept with VR headsets. [Statonwest] added a tiny Ambilight to the Valve Index, making use of the spare USB port on the front of the device which is a nice piece of hacker-friendly design.\nThe VR Ambilight puts the RGB lighting into the users peripheral vision, and just like the original Ambilight, the colors are chosen to match whats happening at the edges of the on-screen content. It involves only an Arduino, some small RGB strips, and a piece of software. If youre curious, it might make a good weekend PC VR project. You just might that stuff already hanging around in your parts bin.\nIf you want to add a DIY Ambilight to your TV, thats not too hard. The best ones will handle any video source."}

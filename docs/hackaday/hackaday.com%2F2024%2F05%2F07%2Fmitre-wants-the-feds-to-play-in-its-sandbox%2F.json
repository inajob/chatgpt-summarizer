Formed in 1958 by the U.S. Air Force as a company to guide the SAGE computer, they are often research experts who oversee government contracts or evaluate proposals. Now they are building a $20 millon AI Sandbox for the Federal government to build AI prototypes.\nPartnered with NVidia, the sandbox will use an NVidia GDX SuperPOD system capable of an exaFLOP of 8-bit AI computation. Mitre reports this will increase their compute power for AI by two orders of magnitude.\n\nAccess to the sandbox will be through one of the six federally funded RD centers that Mitre operates on behalf of the government. These include centers that support the FAA, the IRS, Homeland Security, Social Security, health services, and cybersecurity with NIST. Of course, the DoD is likely in that mix, too.\nSo what do they (or the government) think they are going to do with all this AI power? We dont know. But we are sure well see some colorful guesses in the comments. The fact that it is through the RD centers makes us think an AI might soon be sifting through your taxes soon or maybe routing your next airplane ride. We arent sure if that makes us feel better or worse.\nAI servers seem to be the new supercomputer. The scary part is that what one generation considers a supercomputer, the next generation carries in their pocket."}

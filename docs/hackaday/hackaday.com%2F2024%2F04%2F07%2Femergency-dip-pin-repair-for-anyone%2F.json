Its generally game over, but what if you dont have another chip handy to substitute? Its time to carefully grind away some of the epoxy and solder on a new pin, as [Zafer Yildiz] has done in the video below the break.\nThe technique relies on the pins continuing horizontally inside the package , such that they provide a flat surface. Hes grinding with the disk on a rotary tool, we have to say wed use one of the more delicate grinding heads for something more akin to a miniature die grinder.\nOnce the flat metal surface is exposed, the chip is placed in a socket, and a new pin is cut from the leg of a TO-220 power device. This is carefully bent over, inserted in the socket, and soldered into place. The whole socket and chip arrangement is then used in place of the chip, making for something a little bulky but one infinitely preferable to having to junk the device.\nThere are many useful skills to be learned when it comes to reworking, and weve covered a few in our time. Most recently we saw a guide to lifting SMD pins.\n\n", "title": "DIP\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "DIP\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30d4\u30f3\u304c\u6298\u308c\u305f\u969b\u3001[Zafer Yildiz]\u306f\u30a8\u30dd\u30ad\u30b7\u3092\u524a\u3063\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d4\u30f3\u306f\u6a2a\u306b\u4f38\u3073\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u9762\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30f3\u306fTO-220\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u304b\u3089\u5207\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIP\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4ea4\u63db\u305b\u305a\u306bDIP\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u4fee\u5fa9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fee\u7406: \u30d4\u30f3\u304c\u6298\u308c\u305f\u6642\u306e\u5bfe\u51e6\u6cd5", "\u666e\u901a\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u4ea4\u63db\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308bDIP\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u8853", "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d4\u30f3\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u3066\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5fa9\u65e7\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u4fee\u7406\u6280\u8853"]}

[Christopher Drum] starts his recent article on just that note, remembering the day he and his mother walked into a computer store, and walked out with a brand new Amiga thanks entirely to Deluxe Paint. Forty years on, how well can this killer app compete?\n[Christopher] isnt putting Deluxe Paint head-to-head with modern Photoshop; theyre hardly in the same class. Not Photoshop, no, but modern applications that do what Deluxe Paint did so well: pixel art. There was no need to call it pixel art back then, no, but with the resolutions on hand, all digital art was pixel art in 1985.\nOr 1989, which is when Deluxe Paint III came out thats the last version written by Dan Silva and coincidentally the last version [Christopher] owned, and the one he focuses in on his tests. It has held up amazingly well.\nSure, you dont get a full 24-bit colour palette, but most pixel artists stick to limited palettes still anyway. You dont quite get a modern UI, but presence of useful keyboard shortcuts allows a Hands-On-Keybord-And-Mouse (Well call it HOKAM, in honour of HOTAS in aerospace) workflow that is incredibly efficient.\nAbout the only things [Christopher] found Deluxe Paint III lacked compared to its successors were a proper layering system, and of course the infinite undo weve all gotten so used to. (DPIII has an undo button, but it could only store one operation.) He also complained about cursor latency for some brushes, but we wonder if that might have had something to do with Windows and the emulation layer adding a delay. One thing Amiga was always known for back in the day was the snappy cursor movement, even when the processor was loaded.\nThere were just as many features he found had been forgotten in the new generation  like palatte swapping animations, or flood-filling line gradients.\nIts a small detail, but thats a nice gradient tool.\nAnyone who owned an Amgia probably has fond memories of it, but alas, in spite of Commodores recent resurrection, were not likely to see a new one soon. On the other hand, at least when it comes to pixel art, theres apparently no need to upgrade.\nvia reddit.\n(Thumbnail and header image by Avril Harrison, distributed by Electronic Arts with Deluxe Paint.)", "title": "- \u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\uff1a\u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u306e\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1", "body": "1985\u5e74\u306eDeluxe Paint\u306fAmiga\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u3067\u3001\u4eca\u3067\u3082\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6709\u52b9\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\uff1a\u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u306e\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1", "- \u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b\uff1a\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8 III", "- \u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066\u3082\u8272\u3042\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b", "- \u30a2\u30df\u30ac\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3068\u305d\u306e\u907a\u7523"]}

Instead of neatly packaging them in functional cases, they impose aesthetics and corporate identity on them, usually resulting in a curvy plastic case thats difficult to integrate with other network infrastructure. [The Eccentric Workshop] did something about this with their new Arris modem, by creating a new 19 rack mount for it.\nUnusually for such a device, the plastic case was easy to dismantle. Theres a PCB inside, and a light guide for its LEDs. A new lower-half case and light guide were designed and 3D printed, and the whole was then mounted in a 1U rack case. The special part of this hack perhaps lies in the front panel, a very professionally cut and laser etched affair complete with an Arris logo as though it were meant to be this way.\nWe also like having our infrastructure and other things in a rack here at Hackaday, and fondly remember the days when some surprisingly affordable boxes came with metal wings for rack mounting. Its always possible to use a rack tray, but something like this is so much more attractive.", "title": "- \u300c\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u7f8e\u5b66\uff1aArris\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u5316\u3059\u308b\u300d", "body": "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306f\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u60aa\u304f\u3001\u7d71\u5408\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u304419\u30a4\u30f3\u30c1\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u6539\u826f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u306e\u7f8e\u5b66\uff1aArris\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u3092\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u5316\u3059\u308b\u300d", "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u5883\u5730\uff1a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3057\u305f\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306eDIY\u300d", "- \u300c\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\uff1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5f6b\u523b\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u300d", "- \u300c\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5229\u4fbf\u6027\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u300d", "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30e2\u30c7\u30e0\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u518d\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u6311\u3080\u300d"]}

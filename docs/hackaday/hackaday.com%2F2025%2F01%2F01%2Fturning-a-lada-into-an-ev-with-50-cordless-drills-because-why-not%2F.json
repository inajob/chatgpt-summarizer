That means they dont need to start completely from scratch, and have a frame design that can drop into the vehicle once the engine is constructed.\nFifty cordless drills wont set any efficiency records for EV engines, but its got a certain style.\nHeres whats in the new engine: each of the drills has its chuck replaced with an aluminum pulley, and belts connect each group of drills to an output shaft. Ideally, every drill motor would run at the same time and at exactly the same speed, but one works with what they have. [Garage 54] originally worked to synchronize the drills by interfacing to each drills motor control board, but eventually opted to simply bypass all controls and power each drills motor directly from the batteries. Initial tests are done by touching bare cable ends with a turned-away face and squinted eyes, but we expect Just A Big Switch to end up in the final assembly.\nIt looks wild and we can think of more than a few inefficiencies present in a system like this, but the output shaft does turn and torque is being transferred, so the next step is interfacing to the cars factory gearbox.\nIf it powers the car in any meaningful way, that Lada might very well become the worlds most gloriously hacked-together EV. And hey, if the power output of the EV motor is disappointing, you can just make your own.\n\n\n[via Motor1]"}

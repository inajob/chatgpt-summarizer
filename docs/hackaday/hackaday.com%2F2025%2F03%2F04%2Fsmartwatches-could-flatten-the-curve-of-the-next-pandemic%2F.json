One thing that could help us curb the spread of the next pandemic may already be on your wrist.\nResearchers at Aalto University, Stanford University, and Texas AM have found that the illness detection features common to modern smartwatches are advanced enough to help people make the call to stay home or mask up and avoid getting others sick. They note were already at 88% accuracy for early detection of COVID-19 and 90% for the flu. Combining data from a number of other studies on smartwatch accuracy, epidemiology, behavior, and biology, the researchers were able to model the possible outcomes of this early detection on the spread of future diseases.\nEven just a 66-75 percent reduction in social contacts soon after detection by smartwatches \u2014 keeping in mind that that\u2019s on a par with what you\u2019d normally do if you had cold symptoms \u2014 can lead to a 40-65 percent decrease in disease transmission compared to someone isolating from the onset of symptoms, says M\u00e4rt Vesinurm.\nWeve got you covered if youre looking for a smartwatch that looks a bit like a hospital wristband and weve also covered one thats alive. That way, youll have a slimy friend when youre avoiding other humans this time around. And when its time to develop a vaccine for whatever new bug is after us, how do MRNA vaccines work anyway?"}

OpenSCAD is a coding language for generating 3D objects. ChatGPT can write code. What could possibly go wrong? You should go read his article because it\u2019s enlightening and hilarious, but the punchline is that it ran afoul of syntax errors, but also gave him enough of a foothold that he could teach himself enough OpenSCAD to get the project done anyway. As with many people who have asked the AI to create some code, Dan finds that it\u2019s not as good as asking someone who knows what they\u2019re doing, but that it\u2019s also better than nothing.\nAnd this is where I start grumbling. When you type your desires into the word-follower machine, your alternative isn\u2019t nothing. Your alternative is to fire up a search engine instead and type \u201copenscad tutorial\u201d. That, for nearly any human endeavor, will get you a few good guides, written by humans who are probably expert in the subject in question, and which are aimed at teaching you the thing that you want to learn. It doesn\u2019t get better than that. You\u2019ll be up and running with your design in no time.\nIndeed, if you think about the relevant source material that the LLM was trained on, it\u2019s exactly these tutorials. It can\u2019t possibly do better than the best of them, although the resulting average tutorial might be better than the worst you\u2019ll find. (Some have speculated on what happens when the entire Internet is filled with these generated texts \u2013 what will future AIs learn from?)\nIn Dan\u2019s case, though, he didn\u2019t necessarily want to learn OpenSCAD \u2013 he just wanted the latch designed. But in the end, he had to learn enough OpenSCAD to get the AI code compiling without error. He spent an hour learning OpenSCAD and now he\u2019s good to go on his next project too.\nSo the next time you hear someone say that they got an answer back from a large language model that wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d, think critically if \u201cnothing\u201d is really the right benchmark.\nDo you really want to learn nothing? Do you really have no resources to get started with? I would claim that we have the most amazing set of tutorial resources the world has ever known at our fingertips. Compared to the ability to teach millions of humans to achieve their own goals, that makes the LLM party tricks look kinda weak, in my opinion.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

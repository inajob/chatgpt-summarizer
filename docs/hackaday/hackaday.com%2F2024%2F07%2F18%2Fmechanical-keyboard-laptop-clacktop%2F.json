Well, most people might use an external keyboard until they couldnt take it anymore and bought a new machine. But [Marcin Plaza] isnt most people.\nIt took more than twelve hours of CAD, but [Marcin] redesigned the case to be at least twice as thick as the Lenovo Yoga that inspired this project in order to accommodate a slimmed-down mechanical keyboard. Further weight-loss surgery was required in order to make the keyboard fit, but the end result is kind of a marvel of engineering. Its marriage of sleek modernity and early laptop chonky-ness, and we love it.\nLacking a complete metal fab shop of ones own, [Marcin] elected to have a board house fab it out of titanium and was quite surprised by the result. We really like the clear acrylic bottom, into which [Marcin] drilled many holes for airflow. Be sure to check out the build and demo video after the break.\nDid you initially wonder whether the new case was printed? Thats totally a thing, too.\n\n\nThanks to [Katie] for the tip!", "title": "\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01", "body": "\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u3089\u3001\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u5916\u4ed8\u3051\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u304c\u3001[Marcin Plaza]\u306f\u539a\u3055\u304c2\u500d\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u3001\u8584\u578b\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3002\u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u3068\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u878d\u5408\u3057\u3001\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01", "\u6a5f\u68b0\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30bf\u30a4\u30bf\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0\u88fd\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u5e95\u677f\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7d50\u5a5a", "CAD\u306712\u6642\u9593\u304b\u3051\u3066\u8a2d\u8a08\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7"]}

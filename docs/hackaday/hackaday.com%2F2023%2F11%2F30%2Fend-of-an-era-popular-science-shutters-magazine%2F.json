The brand itself will live on  their site will still run tech stories and news articles, and they have two podcasts that will keep getting new episodes  but no more quarterly releases. While you cant complain too much about a 151 year run, its still sad to see what was once such an influential publication slowly become just another cog in the content mill.\nStarted as a monthly magazine all the way back in 1872, Popular Science offered a hopeful vision of what was over the horizon. It didnt present a fanciful version of what the next 100 years would look like, but rather, tried to read the tea leaves of cutting edge technology to offer a glimpse of what the next decade or so might hold. Flip through a few issues from the 1950s and 60s, and you wont see pulpy stories about humanity conquering the stars or building a time machine. Instead the editors got readers ready for a day when theyd drive cars with warbird-derived turbochargers, and enjoy more powerful tools once transistor technology allowed for widespread use of small brushless motors. It wasnt just armchair engineering either, issues would often include articles written by the engineers and researchers that were on the front lines.\nBut Popular Science wasnt just about the future, it also provided plenty of contemporary content for those who liked to toy with technology at home. You could find articles about building your own test equipment, or setting up your own workshop. From woodworking to homebrew Geiger counters, there was a little something for everyone.\nThis focus on the hobbyist wasnt without its downside. For the last decade or two, the magazine seemed to have more advertisements trying to sell the reader on the latest wiz-bang gadgetry than it did articles. Then again, there are precious few printed publications that didnt suffer that particular fate.\nMuch like when MAKE went through its troubles back in 2019, we have to admit theres a bit of irony at work here. The reality is, sites like the one youre reading right now are the reason tech magazines have become a dying breed. But even if the age of print is coming to a close, we still have great respect for the seminal publications that came before the Internet took over our lives.\nSurely many of the people in this community were inspired to pick up their first soldering iron by something they saw in a magazine like Popular Science, Byte, Popular Electronics, or Hands-On Electronics. We can only hope to do their legacy justice for the next generation."}

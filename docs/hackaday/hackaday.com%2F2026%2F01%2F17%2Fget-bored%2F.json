This meant she had an hour or so of unexpected free time. Momentarily at a loss, she asked me what she should do, and my reply was \u201cslack off\u201d, meaning do something fun and creative instead of doing housework or whatever. Take a break! She jokingly replied that slacking off wasn\u2019t on her to-do list, so she wouldn\u2019t even know how to start.\nBut as with every joke, there\u2019s more than a kernel of truth to it. We often get so busy with stuff that we\u2019ve got to do, that we don\u2019t leave enough time to slack, to get bored, or to simply do nothing. And that\u2019s a pity, because do-nothing time is often among the most creative times. It\u2019s when your mind wanders aimlessly that you find inspiration for that upgrade to the z-stage on your laser cutter, or whatever the current back-burner project of the moment is.\nYou don\u2019t get bored when you\u2019re watching TV, playing video games, or scrolling around the interwebs on your phone, and it\u2019s all too easy to fall into these traps. To get well and truly bored requires discipline these days, so maybe putting \u201cslack\u201d into your to-do list isn\u2019t a bad idea after all. My wife was right! And that\u2019s why I volunteered to take my son to parkour on Sundays \u2013 it\u2019s and hour of guaranteed, 100% uninterruptible boredom. How do you make sure you get your weekly dose of slack?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

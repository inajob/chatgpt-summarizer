Meet Stevens, the AI assistant who provides the family with useful daily briefs. The back end? Little more than one SQLite table and a few cron jobs.\nA sample of Stevens notebook entries, both events and things to simply remember.\nEvery day, Stevens sends a daily brief via Telegram that includes calendar events, appointments, weather notes, reminders, and even a fun fact for the day. Stevens isnt just send-only, either. Users can add new entries or ask questions about items through Telegram.\nIts rudimentary, but [Geoffrey] already finds it far more useful than Siri. This is unsurprising, as it has been astutely observed that big techs digital assistants are designed to serve their makers rather than their users. Besides, its also fun to have the freedom to give an assistant its own personality, something existing offerings sorely lack.\nArchitecture-wise, the assistant has a notebook (the single SQLite table) that gets populated with entries. These entries come from things like reading family members Google calendars, pulling data from a public weather API, processing delivery notices from the post office, and Telegram conversations. With a notebook of such entries (along with a date the entry is expected to be relevant), generating a daily brief is simple. After all, LLMs (Large Language Models) are amazingly good at handling and formatting natural language. Thats something even a locally-installed LLM can do with ease.\n[Geoffrey] says that even this simple architecture is super useful, and its not even a particularly complex system. He encourages anyone whos interested to check out his project, and see for themselves how useful even a minimally-informed assistant can be when its designed with ones own needs in mind."}

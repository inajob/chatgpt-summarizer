Many existing suits pack in a few speakers or vibration motors to give feedback to the wearer. Kinethreads aims to go further, serving as a full-body haptic suit using an innovative mechanical setup.\nKinethreads is effectively an exosuit, which mounts several motorized pulley systems to the wearers body. These pulleys are attached to the users hands, feet, back, torso, and head via strings. By winding in the pulleys, its possible for the device to effectively tug on different parts of the body, creating rich, dynamic physical feedback that can easily be felt and interpreted by the user. The whole system weighs 4.6 kilograms\u2014not light, but very practical. It can also run for 6 hours on a single charge. The whole suit can be donned or doffed in under a minute. Cost is stated to be under $500.\n\nIts a particularly interesting device for VR use. The team notes applications such as simulating the weight of picking up a virtual object, creating the feeling of virtual gravity, or giving continuous dynamic feedback during a driving simulation. Other demos include mimicking the sensation of touching hard objects, or the more diffuse feeling of standing under a waterfall.\nAs virtual worlds become a bigger part of our daily lives, expect ever more developments in these kinds of exosuit feedback systems. Weve seen other great work in this space before, too.

However, they can also be a little more artistic and eye-catching, like this windmill lamp from [Huy Vector].\nIts somewhat of a charming desk toy, constructed out of copper wire soldered into the form of a traditional windmill. At its base, lives a simple motor speed controller, while up top, a brushed DC gearmotor is responsible for turning the blades. As you might imagine, its a little tricky to get power to flow to the LED filaments installed on those blades while they happen to be rotating. Thats where the build gets tricky, using the output shaft of the motors gear drive and a custom slip ring to pass power to the LEDs. That power comes courtesy of a pair of 16340 lithium-ion cells, which can be juiced up with the aid of a USB-C charger board.\nIts an elegant build, and rather charming to watch in motion to boot. We love a good lamp build here at Hackaday, particularly when theyre aesthetically beautiful.\n\n"}

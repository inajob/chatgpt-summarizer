Mars has been an obvious choice since before the Space Age; in the orbit of Jupiter, Europas oceans have been of interest since Voyagers day; the geysers of Enceladus give Saturn two moons of interest, if you count the possibility of a methane-based chemistry on Titan. Even faraway Neptunes giant moon Triton probably has an ocean layer deep inside. Now the planet Uranus is getting in on the act, offering its moon Miranda for consideration in a kinda-recent\u00a0study in the Planetary Science Journal.\n\nMiranda and Uranus, the new hot spot for life-hunters.\u00a0Photomontage credit NASA.\nEven if youre into astronomy, it may seem like this is coming out of left field. Miranda, really? What new data could we possibly have on a moon of Neptune nobodys visited since the 1980s? Well, none, really. This study relies on reexamining the data collected during the Voyager 2 encounter and trying to make sense of the chaotic, icy world that the space probe revealed.\nThe faults and other features on Miranda indicated it was geologically active at some point; this study tries to recreate the moons history through computer modelling to find that Miranda probably had a \u2265100 km thick ocean sometime in the last 100-500 million years, and that while some of it has likely frozen since, tidal heating could very well keep a layer of liquid water within the moons interior. Since the moon itself is only 470 km (290 mi) in diameter, a 100km deep ocean layer would actually be a huge proportion of its volume.\nThe model is a fairly simple one, with the ocean sandwiched between two layers of ice and a rocky core.

It remains to be seen if Miranda, or indeed any of the icy moons, ever evolved so much as a microbe. Aside from the supposed presence of liquid dihydrogen monoxide, theres nothing to suggest they have. Finding out is going to take a while: even with boots  er, robots  on the ground, Mars isnt giving up that secret easily. Still, if were able to discover irrefutable evidence for such extraterrestrial life, it will provide an important constraint on one term of The Drake Equation: what fraction of worlds develop life. That by itself wont tell us are we alone, but it will be interesting.\nOf course, even if all these worlds are barren now, they might not be for long, once our probes start visiting.\nStory via Earth.com\nHeader image: Miranda, imaged by Voyager 2.

Unfortunately, full-sized versions are bulky and not ideal when youre travelling or for certain portable applications. [Applepie1928] decided to create a small travel keyboard to solve these problems.\nMeet the Micro Planck. Its a simple ortholinear mechanical keyboard in a decidedly compact form factor\u2014measuring just 23 cm wide, 9.5 cm tall, and 2 cm deep. You could probably stuff it in your pocket if you wear baggy jeans. Oh, and if you dont know what ortholinear means, it just means that the keys are in a straight grid instead of staggered. Kind of like those keyboards at the bowling alley.\nThe build relies on Gateron KS-33 switches installed on a custom PCB, with a ATmega32U4 microcontroller running the popular open source QMK firmware. The keyboard has a USB-C port because its 2024, and all the components are wrapped up in a neat 3D printed shell.\nOverall, its a tasteful design that packs in a lot of functionality. Its also neat to see a mechanical design used which offers more tactile feedback than the rubber dome designs more typical at this scale. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own nifty keyboard designs, dont hesitate to let us know what youre up to!"}

It seems like [Miles Goodhew] heard the call, and wanted to put a Dell Wyse 3040 thin client to use  in this case as a wireless router. It seems simple enough. OpenWrt supports x64_64 targets, and the thin client has 2G of ram and 8G of flash. It should make for a very capable router.\nAnd before you tell us that its just another computer, and that installing OpenWrt on a miniature x86 machine isnt a hack, note that there were some speedbumps along the way. First off, the motherboard has integrated storage, with the not-very-useful ThinLinux installed, and the system BIOS locked down to prevent reinstall. There is a BIOS clear button on the systems diminutive motherboard. With the BIOS lock out of the way, a real Linux system can be installed on the small 8 GB mmcblk device.\nThe next issue the the CPU. Its an Intel Atom x5 z-series. OpenWrt wont actually boot on that oddball, not-quite- processor, so [Miles] opted to install Fedora and test via virtualization instead. If that statement makes you do a double-take, youre not alone. The initial explanation sounded like the mobile-centric processor was missing instructions to make OpenWrt run, but virtualization doesnt add any instructions for a guest to use. It turns out, the problem is a missing serial port that OpenWrt uses as a debugging output by default.\nAfter a custom OpenWrt compile, the device comes up just as youd expect, and while it would be underpowered as a desktop, OpenWrt runs happily shuffling bits from Ethernet to wireless adapter at respectable speeds. As [Miles] points out, theres nothing ground-breaking here, but its nice to have the details on re-using these machines compiled in one place. And if you too love the idea of putting OpenWrt in places where nobody intended, weve got you covered.", "title": "Dell Wyse 3040 thin client\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Dell Wyse 3040 thin client\u3092\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001OpenWrt\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002BIOS\u306e\u5236\u9650\u3092\u89e3\u9664\u3057\u3001Linux\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3002Intel Atom x5 z\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u8d77\u52d5\u3057\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u4eee\u60f3\u5316\u3067Fedora\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002OpenWrt\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u5229\u7528\u3002\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u8ee2\u9001\u901f\u5ea6\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3002", "titles": ["Dell Wyse 3040 thin client\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u8ab0\u3082\u4e88\u60f3\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u5834\u6240\u306bOpenWrt\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2x86\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306bOpenWrt\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3059\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "Intel Atom x5 z-series\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u4e0a\u3067\u306eOpenWrt\u306e\u8d77\u52d5\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

A word-of-the-day calendar can help, and theyre often readily available off the shelf. Or, you can grab some hardware and build your own, as [daedal-tech] did!\nThe project was built as a gift to help [daedal-tech]s partner with their efforts to pick up French. Thus, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W was employed and paired with a small Waveshare e-Paper display. These were stuffed inside a fancy light switch plate from Hobby Lobby and a small stand, the pair of which act as a pretty nice little frame for the build. The Pi runs a small Python script which employs the BeautifulSoup4 library and the Python Image library. Basically, the script grabs French words and spits them out on the display with a small description such that one might understand their meaning.\nIts a simple build, but one that has some real utility and is fun to boot. We might see more word clocks than calendars around these parts, but we love both all the same!", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300c\u8a00\u8449\u306e\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u300d", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u8a00\u8449\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u8a9e\u5b66\u7fd2\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u300c\u8a00\u8449\u306e\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u300d", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u8a9e\u5b66\u7fd2\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046", "e-Paper\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5358\u8a9e\u8868\u793a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Python\u3068BeautifulSoup4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8a00\u8449\u5b66\u7fd2\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u5b8c\u6210\u3055\u305b\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

Well, it doesnt get much more portable than a hat keyboard, now does it?\nEvery October 1st, Google Japan likes to celebrate the 101-key keyboard by building something revolutionary off the top of their heads. (10/1 101 get it?) This year was no exception  they created the GCAPS, a ballcap-like device with a single switch inside.\nIn order to use it, you spin the hat left and right until the desired character is reached, and the rotation is detected by a gyroscope. Then you press down on the top of the hat to send the key codes via Bluetooth.\nUnder the hood, the hat uses an M5Stick C Plus and, to our dismay, a micro switch that wasnt even made by Cherry. Oh well \u00a0 we landed on the clicky side, so thats great in our book. Surprisingly, there exists a skull cap/hat skeleton thing on which to build a platform for pressing down on the switch. Just like the teaboard and the long boi keyboards, this thing is completely open source.\nSince it types in Japanese, theres no word on whether it types in all caps, though we like to think that it would given the object it represents. Be sure to check out the product reveal video after the break.\n\n"}

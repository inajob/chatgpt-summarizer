Unfortunately the company went bankrupt a few years ago, but there are still plenty of them about, and its one of these that [Doctor D.S.] gives an electric conversion in the video below the break.\nThe electronics are a standard 5 kW off-the-shelf Chinese kit, but in this they arent the star of the show so much as the work on the bike. As with any old moped its a bit ropey, and he strips it down and reconditions every part of it alongside his work fabricating brackets, a battery box, and a seat. Its a long video, but its one of those workshop sequences that you can become engrossed in.\nThe result appears to be a very practical, powerful (for a moped) and rideable bike, and its one wed have for buzzing around town any day. Wed like to take a look at that battery box and seat combo on the interests of safety, but otherwise its pretty spot-on. Sit back and enjoy a bit of quality workshop video!\nIf youre hungry for more, this is by no means the first road bike electric conversion weve brought you.\n\n"}

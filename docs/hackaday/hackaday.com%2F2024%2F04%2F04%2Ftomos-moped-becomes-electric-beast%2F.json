Unfortunately the company went bankrupt a few years ago, but there are still plenty of them about, and its one of these that [Doctor D.S.] gives an electric conversion in the video below the break.\nThe electronics are a standard 5 kW off-the-shelf Chinese kit, but in this they arent the star of the show so much as the work on the bike. As with any old moped its a bit ropey, and he strips it down and reconditions every part of it alongside his work fabricating brackets, a battery box, and a seat. Its a long video, but its one of those workshop sequences that you can become engrossed in.\nThe result appears to be a very practical, powerful (for a moped) and rideable bike, and its one wed have for buzzing around town any day. Wed like to take a look at that battery box and seat combo on the interests of safety, but otherwise its pretty spot-on. Sit back and enjoy a bit of quality workshop video!\nIf youre hungry for more, this is by no means the first road bike electric conversion weve brought you.\n\n", "title": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u3068\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u3067\u88fd\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4TOMOS 50cc\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u5316", "body": "\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u306e\u9053\u8def\u3067\u983b\u7e41\u306b\u898b\u304b\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308bTOMOS 50cc\u30e2\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u82e5\u8005\u306b\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u72ec\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u79fb\u52d5\u624b\u6bb5\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4f1a\u793e\u306f\u6570\u5e74\u524d\u306b\u7834\u7523\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u304d\u308b5 kW\u306e\u4e2d\u56fd\u88fd\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u4e57\u7528\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3068\u3057\u3066\u512a\u308c\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u304c\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3068\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e6\u30fc\u30b4\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u3068\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u3067\u88fd\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4TOMOS 50cc\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u5316", "TOMOS 50cc\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u3059\u308b\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa", "TOMOS 50cc\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3078\u306e\u5909\u63db\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "TOMOS 50cc\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u30d1\u30ef\u30d5\u30eb\u306a\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u306b", "TOMOS 50cc\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080"]}

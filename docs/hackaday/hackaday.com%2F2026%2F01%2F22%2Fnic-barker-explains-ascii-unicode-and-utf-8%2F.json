And when you deal with text data, in this day and age, there are really only two main things you need to know: 7-bit ASCII and UTF-8. In this video [Nic] explains 7-bit ASCII and Unicode, and then explains UTF-8 and how it relates to Unicode and ASCII. [Nic] goes into detail about some of the clever features of Unicode and UTF-8 such as self-synchronization, single-byte ASCII, multi-byte codepoints, leading bytes, continuation bytes, and grapheme clusters.\n[Nic] mentions about UTF-16, but UTF-16 turned out to be a really bad idea. UTF-16 combines all of the disadvantages of UTF-8 with all of the disadvantages of UTF-32. In UTF-16 there are things known as surrogate pairs, which means a single Unicode codepoint might require two UTF-16 characters to describe it. Also the Byte Order Marks (BOM) introduced with UTF-16 proved to be problematic. Particularly if you cat files together you can end up with stray BOM indicators randomly embedded in your new file. They say that null was a billion dollar mistake, well, UTF-16 was the other billion dollar mistake.\ntl;dr: dont use UTF-16, but do use 7-bit ASCII and UTF-8.\nOh, and as were here, and talking about Unicode, did you know that you can support The Unicode Consortium with Unicode Adopt-a-Character? You send money to sponsor a character and they put your name up in lights! Win, win! (We noticed while doing the research for this post that Jeroen Frijters of IKVM fame has sponsored #, a nod to C#.)\nIf youre interested in learning more about Unicode check out Understanding And Using Unicode and Building Up Unicode Characters One Bit At A Time.\n\n", "title": "- UTF-8\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u52d5\u753b\u3067UTF-8\u30687-bit ASCII\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002UTF-16\u306f\u63a8\u5968\u3055\u308c\u305a\u3001\u554f\u984c\u70b9\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- UTF-8\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- Unicode\u3068ASCII\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u306a\u305cUTF-16\u306f\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3079\u304d\u306a\u306e\u304b\uff1f", "- \u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u51e6\u7406\u306b\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u77e5\u8b58", "- Unicode\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u652f\u63f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f"]}

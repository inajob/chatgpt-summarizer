Even astronomers werent aware of its existence until the Kepler Space Telescope picked it out back in 2015, just one of the more than 2,700 planets the now defunct observatory was able to identify during its storied career. But now, thanks to recent observations by the James Web Space Telescope, this obscure planet has been thrust into the limelight by the discovery of what researchers believe are the telltale signs of life in its atmosphere.\nArtists rendition of planet K2-18b.\nWell, maybe. As you might imagine, being able to determine if a planet has life on it from 124 light-years away isnt exactly easy. We havent even been able to conclusively rule out past, or even present, life in our very own solar system, which in astronomical terms is about as far off as the end of your block.\nTo be fair the University of Cambridges Institute of Astronomy researchers, lead by Nikku Madhusudhan, arent claiming to have definitive proof that life exists on K2-18b. We probably wont get undeniable proof of life on another planet until a rover literally runs over it. Rather, their paper proposes that abundant biological life, potentially some form of marine phytoplankton, is one of the strongest explanations for the concentrations of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide that theyve detected in the atmosphere of K2-18b.\nAs you might expect, there are already challenges to that conclusion. Which is of course exactly how the scientific process is supposed to work. Though the findings from Cambridge are certainly compelling, adding just a bit of context can show that things arent as cut and dried as we might like. Theres even an argument to be made that we wouldnt necessarily know what the signs of extraterrestrial life would look like even if it was right in front of us.\n\nLife as We Know It\nCredit where credit is due, most of the news outlets have so far treated this story with the appropriate amount of skepticism. Reading though the coverage, Cambridges findings are commonly described as the strongest evidence yet of potential extraterrestrial life, rather than being treated as definitive proof. Well, other than the Daily Mail anyway. They decided to consult with ChatGPT and other AI tools in an effort to find out what lifeforms on K2-18b would look like.\nSo, AI-generated frogmen renders not withstanding, what makes these findings so difficult to interpret? For one thing, we have very little idea of what extraterrestrial life would actually be like, so proving that it exists is exceptionally difficult. Scientists have precisely one data point for what constitutes as life, and youre sitting on it. We only know what life on Earth looks like, and while theres an incredible amount of biodiversity on our home planet, it all still tends to play by the same established rules.\nOn Earth, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced by phytoplankton.\nWe assume those rules to be a constant on other planets, but thats only because we dont know what else to look for. Consider that the bulk of our efforts in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) thus far have been based on the idea that other sentient beings would develop some form of radio technology similar to our own, and that if we simply pointed a receiver at their star, we would be able to pick up their version of I Love Lucy.\nThis is a preposterous presupposition, which doesnt even make much sense when compared to humanitys history. Consider the science, literature, and art that humankind was able to produce before the advent of the electric light. Now imagine that Proxima Centauris answer to Beethoven is putting the finishing touches on their latest masterpiece as our radio telescope silently checks their planet off the list of inhabited worlds because it wasnt emanating any RF transmissions we recognize.\nSimilarly, here on Earth dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) are produced exclusively by biological processes. DMS specifically is so commonly associated with marine phytoplankton that we often associate its smell with being in proximity of the sea. This being the case, you could see how finding large quantities of these gases in the atmosphere of an alien planet would seem to indicate that it must be teaming with aquatic life.\nBut just because thats true on Earth doesnt mean its true on K2-18b. We know these gases can be created abiotically in the laboratory, which means there are alternative explanations to how they could be produced on another planet  even if we cant explain them currently. Further, a paper released in November 2024 pointed out that DMS was detected on comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko by the European Space Agencys Rosetta spacecraft, indicating theres some unknown method by which it can be produced in the absence of any biological activity.\nFinding What Youre Looking For\nAll that being said, lets assume for the sake of argument that the presence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide was indeed enough to confirm there was life on the planet. Youd still need to confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt that those gases were present in the atmosphere. So how do you do that?\nWithin our own solar system, you could send a probe. Which is whats been suggested to investigate the possibility that phosphine gas exists on Venus. But remember, were talking about a planet thats 124 light-years away. In this case, the only way to study the atmosphere is through spectroscopy  that is, examining the degree to which various wavelengths of light (visible and otherwise) are blocked as they pass through it.\n\nThis is, as you may have guessed, easier said than done. The amount of data you can collect from such a distant object, even with an instrument as powerful as the James Webb Space Telescope is minuscule. You need to massage the data with various models to extract any useful information from the noise, and according to some critics, thats when bias can creep in.\nIn a recently released paper, Jake Taylor from the University of Oxford argues that the only reason Nikku Madhusudhan and his team found signs of DMS and DMDS in the spectrographic data is because thats what they were looking for. Given their previous research that potentially detected methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of K2-18b, its possible the team was already primed to find further evidence of biological processes on the planet, and were looking a bit too hard to find evidence to back up their theory.\nWhen analyzing the raw data without any preconceived notion of what youre looking for, Taylor says theres no strong statistical evidence to support the detection of DMS and DMDS in the atmosphere of K2-18b. This conclusion itself will need to be scrutinized, of course, though it does have the benefit of Occams razor on its side.\nIn short, there may or may not be dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide gases in the atmosphere of K2-18b, and that may or may not mean theres potentially some form of biological life in the planets oceanswhich it may or may not actually have. If youre looking for anything more specific than that, the science is still out."}

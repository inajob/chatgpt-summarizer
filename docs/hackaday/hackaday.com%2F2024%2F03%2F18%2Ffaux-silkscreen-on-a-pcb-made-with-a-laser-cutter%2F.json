However, if youre making your own, the job is on you. [Tony Goacher] makes his own PCBs on a CNC router, so hes not getting any silkscreening as part of that bargain. But he wondered\u2014could he do something analogous with a laser cutter?\nThe answer is yes. The silkscreen layer was first exported from DesignSpark, with the file then sent to LightBurn to prep it for laser cutting. The board outline layer was first engraved on to a piece of scrap as an alignment aid. Then, the board was placed in the laser cutter, with the silkscreen scorched directly on to the fiberglass.\nThe results are encouraging, if imperfect. [Tony] says he ran at quite fast speed at quite high power. The markings are all there, but theyre a little melty and difficult to read. He noted at lower speeds and lower power, the results were a bit more readable.\nPCBs arent really an ideal engraving or laser marking material, but this technique could be servicable for some basic markings on DIY PCBs. We look forward to seeing how [Tony] improves the process in future. Video after the break.\n\n"}

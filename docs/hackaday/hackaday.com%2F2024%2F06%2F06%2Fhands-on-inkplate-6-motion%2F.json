While saying the technology is now cheap might be overstating the situation a bit, the prices on at least small e-paper panels have certainly become far more reasonable for the hobbyist. Pair one of them with a modern microcontroller such as the RP2040 or ESP32, sprinkle in a few open source libraries, and youre well on the way to creating an energy-efficient smart display for your home or office.\nBut therein lies the problem. Theres still a decent amount of leg work involved in getting the hardware wired up and talking to each other. Putting the e-paper display and MCU together is often only half the battle  depending on your plans, youll probably want to add a few sensors to the mix, or perhaps some RGB status LEDs. An onboard battery charger and real-time clock would be nice as well. Pretty soon, your homebrew e-paper gadget is starting to look remarkably like the bottom of your junk bin.\nFor those after a more integrated solution, the folks at Soldered Electronics have offered up a line of premium open source hardware development boards that combine various styles of e-paper panels (touch, color, lighted, etc) with a microcontroller, an array of sensors, and pretty much every other feature they could think of. To top it off, they put in the effort to produce fantastic documentation, easy to use libraries, and free support software such as an online GUI builder and image converter.\nWeve reviewed a number of previous Inkplate boards, and always came away very impressed by the attention to detail from Soldered Electronics. When they asked if wed be interested in taking a look at a prototype for their new MOTION 6 board, we were eager to see what this new variant brings to the table. Since both the software and hardware are still pre-production, we wont call this a review, but it should give you a good idea of what to expect when the final units start shipping out in October.\n\nFaster and Stronger\nAs mentioned previously, the Inkplate boards have generally been differentiated by the type of e-paper display theyve featured. In the case of the new MOTION, the theme this time around is speed  Soldered says this new display is capable of showing 11 frames per second, no small feat for a technology thats notoriously slow to refresh. You still wont be watching movies at 11 FPS of course, but its more than enough to display animations and dynamic information thanks to its partial refresh capability that only updates the areas of the display where the image has actually changed.\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/inkplate6m_demo.mp4\nBut its not just the e-paper display thats been swapped out for a faster model. For the MOTION 6, Soldered traded in the ESP32 used on all previous Inkplates for the STM32H743, an ARM Cortex-M7 chip capable of running at 480 MHz. Well, at least partially. Youll still find an ESP32 hanging out on the back of the MOTION 6, but its there as a co-processor to handle WiFi and Bluetooth communications. The STM32 chip features 1 MB of internal SRAM and has been outfitted with a whopping 32 MB of external DRAM, which should come in handy when youre throwing 4-bit grayscale images at the 1024 x 758 display.\n\nThe Inkplate MOTION 6 also features an impressive suite of sensors, including a front-mounted APDS-9960 which can detect motion, proximity, and color. On the backside youll find the SHTC3 for detecting temperature and humidity, as well as a LSM6DSO32 accelerometer and gyroscope. One of the most impressive demos included in the MOTION 6s Arduino library pulls data from the gyro and uses it to rotate a wireframe 3D cube as you move the device around. Should you wish to connect other sensors or devices to the board, youve got breakouts for the standard expansion options such as I\u00b2C and SPI, as well as Ethernet, USB OTG, I\u00b2S, SDMMC, and UART.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough no battery is included with the MOTION 6, theres a connector for one on the back of the board, and the device includes a MCP73831 charge controller and the appropriate status LEDs. Primary power is supplied through the boards USB-C connector, and theres also a set of beefy solder pads along the bottom edge where you could wire up an external power source.\nFor user input you have three physical buttons along the side, and a rather ingenious rotary encoder  but to explain how that works we need to switch gears and look at the 3D printed enclosure Soldered has created for the Inkplate MOTION 6.\nWrapped Up Tight\nUnder normal circumstances I wouldnt go into so much detail about a 3D printed case, but Ive got to give Soldered credit for the little touches they put into this design. Living hinges are used for both the power button and the three user buttons on the side, theres a holder built into the back for a pouch battery, and theres even a little purple programming tool that tucks into a dedicated pocket  youll use that to poke the programming button when the Inkplate is inside the enclosure.\n\nBut the real star is the transparent wheel on the right hand side. The embedded magnet in the center lines up perfectly with a AS5600 magnetic angle encoder on the Inkplate, with an RGB LED just off to the side. Reading the value from the AS5600 as the wheel rotates gives you a value between 0 and 4048, and the library offers macros to convert that to radians and degrees. Combined with the RGB LED, this arrangement provides an input device with visual feedback at very little cost.\n\n\n\n\nIts an awesome idea, and now Im looking for an excuse to include it in my own hardware designs.\n\nThe 3D printed case is being offered as an add-on for the Inkplate MOTION 6 at purchase time, but both the STLs and\u00a0 Fusion 360 files for it will be made available with the rest of the hardware design files for those that would rather print it themselves.\nAn Exciting Start\nAs I said in the beginning of this article, the unit I have here is the prototype  while the hardware seems pretty close to final, the software side of things is obviously still in the early stages. Some of the libraries simply werent ready in time, so I wasnt able to test things like WiFi or Bluetooth. Similarly, I wasnt able to try out the MicroPython build for the MOTION 6. That said, I have absolutely no doubt that the team at Soldered Electronics will have everything where it needs to be by the time customers get their hands on the final product.\nTheres no denying that the $169 USD price tag of the Inkplate MOTION 6 will give some users pause. If youre looking for a budget option, this absolutely isnt it. But what you get for the price is considerable. Youre not just paying for the hardware, youre also getting the software, documentation, schematics, and PCB design files. If those things are important to you, Id say its more than worth the premium price.\nSo far, it looks like plenty of people feel the same way. As of this writing, the Inkplate MOTION 6 is about to hit 250% of its funding goal on Crowd Supply, with more than 30 days left in the campaign."}

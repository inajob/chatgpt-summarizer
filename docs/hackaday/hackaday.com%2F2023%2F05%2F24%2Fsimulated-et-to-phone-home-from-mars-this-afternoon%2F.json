In real life, though, we think it will be tough. Today, youll get your chance to see how tough when a SETI project uses the European Space Agencys ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to send a simulated alien message to the Earth. The transmission is scheduled to happen at 1900 UTC and, of course, the signal will take about 16 minutes to arrive here on planet Earth. You can see a video about the project, A Sign in Space,\u00a0below.\nYou dont need to receive the message yourself. That will be the job of observatories at the SETI Institute, the Green Bank Observatory, and the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics. Theyll make the signal available to everyone, and you can join others on Discord or work solo and submit your interpretation of the message.\nDrakes message properly arranged\nThere are a host of issues involved in alien communication. What communication medium will they use? How will they encode their message? Will the message even make sense? Imagine an engineer from 1910 trying to find, decode, and understand an ad on FM radio station 107.9. First, theyd have to find the signal. Then figure out FM modulation. Then theyd probably wonder what the phrase smartphone could possibly mean.\nWhen [Frank Drake] created a test message to send to aliens via the Arecibo dish, almost no one could decode it unless they already knew how it worked. But even looking at the message in the accompanying image, you probably can only puzzle out some of it. Dont forget; this message was created by another human.\nIf you want a foreshadowing of how hard this is, you can try decoding the bitstream yourself. Of course, that page assumes you already figured out that the stream of bits is, in fact, a stream of bits and that it should be set in an image pattern. You also have the advantage of knowing what the right answer looks like. It could easily become an extraterrestrial Rorschach test where you find patterns and meaning in every permutation of bits.\nSpeaking of the Drake message, it saddens us to think that Arecibo is gone. The closest we think weve come to intercepting alien messages is the Wow signal.\n\n"}

Although the format became synonymous with the digital music revolution that started in the late 90s, as an audio compression format there is an argument to be made that it has long since been superseded by better formats and other changes. [Ibrahim Diallo] makes that very argument in a recent blog post. In a world with super fast Internet speeds and the abstracting away of music formats behind streaming services, few people still care about MP3.\nThe last patents for the MP3 format expired in 2012 in the EU and\u00a0 2017 in the US, ending many years of incessant legal sniping. For those of us learning of the wonders of MP3 back around 98 through services like Napster or Limewire, MP3s meant downloading music on 56k dialup in a matter of minutes to hours rather than days to weeks with WAV, and with generally better quality than Microsofts WMA format at lower bitrates. When portable media players came onto the scene, they were called MP3 players, a name that stuck around.\nBut is MP3 really obsolete and best forgotten in the dustbin of history at this point? Would anyone care if computers dropped support\u00a0 for MP3 tomorrow?\n\nAlternatives\nIts hard to disagree with [Ibrahim]s point that MP3 isnt quite as important anymore. Still, his argument of AAC being a good alternative to MP3 misses that the AAC format is also patent-encumbered. Specifically, theres a patent license for all manufacturers and developers of end-user codecs, which involves per-unit pricing. Effectively, every device (computer, headphones, smartphone, etc.) incurs a fee. Thats why projects like FFmpeg implement AAC and other encumbered formats while leaving the legal responsibilities to the end-user who actually uses the code.\nWhile FLAC and Vorbis (ogg) are truly open formats, theyre not as widely supported by devices. Much like VGA, MP3 isnt so much sticking around because its a superior technological solution but because it Just Works\u00ae anywhere, unlike fancier formats. From dollar store MP3 players to budget boomboxes to high-end audio gear, theyll all playback MP3s just fine. Other formats are likely to be a gamble, at best.\nThis compatibility alone means that MP3 is hard to dislodge, with formats like Ogg Vorbis trying to do so for decades and still being relatively unknown and poorly supported, especially when considering hardware implementations.\nAudio Quality\nSince the average person is not an audiophile who is concerned with exact audio reproduction and can hear every audio compression artefact, MP3 is still perfectly fine in an era where the (MP2-era) Bluetooth SBC codec is what most people seem to be content with. In that sense, listening to 320 kbps VBR MP3 files with wired headphones is a superior experience over listening to FLAC files with the Bluetooth SBC codec in between.\nThis leads to another point made by [Ibrahim]. The average person does not deal with files anymore. Many people use online applications for everything from multimedia to documents, which happily abstract away the experience of managing file formats. Yet, at the same time, theres a resurgence in interest in physical media and owning a physical copy of content, which means dealing with files.\nWe see this also with MP3 players. Even though companies like Apple abandoned their iPod range and Sonys current Walkmans are mostly rebranded Android smartphones with the phone part stripped out, plenty of portable media players are available brand-new. People want portable access to their media in any format.\nAmidst this market shift back to a more basic, less online focus, the MP3 format may not be as visible as it was even a decade ago, but it is by no means dead.\nThese days, rolling your own MP3 player is almost trivial. Weve seen some fairly small ones.\n"}

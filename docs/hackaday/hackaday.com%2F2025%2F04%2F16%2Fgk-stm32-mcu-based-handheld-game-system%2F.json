A case in point is the GK handheld gaming system by [John Cronin], which uses an MCU from relatively new and very capable STM32H7S7 series, specifically the 225-pin STM32H7S7L8 in TFBGA package with a single Cortex-M7 clocked at 600 MHz and a 2D NeoChrom GPU.\nCoupled with this MCU are 128 MB of XSPI (hexa-SPI) SDRAM, a 640480 color touch screen, gyrometer, WiFi network support and the custom gkOS in the firmware for loading games off an internal SD card. A USB-C port is provided to both access said SD cards contents and for recharging the internal Li-ion battery.\nAs can be seen in the demonstration video, it runs a wide variety of games, ranging from Doom (of course), Quake (doh), as well as Red Alert and emulators for many consoles, with the Mednafen project used to emulate GB, SNES and other systems at 20+ FPS. Although there arent a lot of details on how optimized the current firmware is, it seems to be pretty capable already.\n\n", "title": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308bDIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "body": "\u6700\u65b0\u306eMCU\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fGK\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3067\u3001\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u4f5c\u308bDIY\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f", "STM32H7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fGK\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "600MHz Cortex-M7\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u5185\u8535SD\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0gkOS", "USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

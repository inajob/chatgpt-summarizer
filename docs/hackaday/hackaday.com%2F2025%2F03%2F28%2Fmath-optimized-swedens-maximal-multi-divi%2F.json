Adding machines existed, but they werent exactly convenient nor cheap. Enter Vilin Vinson and his Maximal Multi-Divi, a massive multiplication and division table that turned math into an industrialized process. Originally published in Sweden in the 1910s, and refined over decades, his book was more than a reference. It was a modular calculating instrument, optimized for speed and efficiency. In this video, [Chris Staeker] tells all about this fascinating relic.\nWhat makes the Multi-Divi special isnt just its sheer size  handling up to 9995 \u00d7 995 multiplications  but its clever design. Vinson formatted the book like a machine, with modular sections that could be swapped out for different models. If you needed an expanded range, you could just swap in an extra 200 pages. To sell it internationally, just replace the insert  no translation needed. The book itself contains zero words, only numbers. Even the marketing pushed this as a serious calculating device, rather than just another dusty math bible.\nWhile pinwheel machines and comptometers were available at the time, they required training and upkeep. The Multi-Divi, in contrast, required zero learning curve  just look up the numbers for instant result. And it wasnt just multiplication: the book also handled division in reverse, plus compound interest, square roots, and even amortizations. Vinson effectively created a pre-digital computing tool, a kind of pocket calculator on steroids (if pockets were the size of briefcases).\nOf course, no self-respecting hacker would take claims of the greatest invention ever at face value. Vinsons marketing, while grandiose, wasnt entirely wrong  the Multi-Divi outpaced mechanical calculators in speed tests. And if youre feeling adventurous, [Chris Staeker] has scanned the entire book, so you can try it yourself.

To be clear, the sound is never that great. But perhaps a selling point for this crowd is that they usually come in hinged cases with handles, and you know what that means  cyberdeck that thing!\n[Mx. Jack Nelson] started gutting this Crosley CR40 record player to make a Raspberry Pi housing, but it quickly turned into a cyberdeck project with the addition of a 10.1 portable monitor, a Planck ortholinear keyboard, and a gutted trackball mouse.\nWe love that [Mx. Jack Nelson] made use of the Crosleys original speakers  this was the wifes idea!  as well as the volume and tone knobs. But our favorite part has to be the clear acrylic top that both protects the electronics and provides a platform for the keyboard and mouse buttons. Be sure to check out the demo video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n"}

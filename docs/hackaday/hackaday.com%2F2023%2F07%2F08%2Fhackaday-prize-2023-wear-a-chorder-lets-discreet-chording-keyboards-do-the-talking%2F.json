Keeping the chorders at waist level and ensuring high-quality speech is generated and delivered quickly goes a long way towards making interaction and communication flow more naturally.\nThe VoiceBox software is doing the heavy lifting, and theres not yet much detail about the rest of the hardware used in the prototype. Its currently up to the user to figure out a solution for a wearable computer or a suitable chording keyboard. Still, the prototype looks like the Charachorder with a 3D-printed mounting solution to locate them at ones beltline. Of course, the beauty of the underlying system being so standard is that one can use whatever is most comfortable.\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\u624b\u8a71\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u8aad\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "2023\u5e74\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u3078\u306e\u8ca2\u732e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u767a\u8a71\u969c\u5bb3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3002\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306e\u767a\u8a71\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308bWeb\u30a2\u30d7\u30eaVoiceBox\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u672a\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["\u624b\u8a71\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u8aad\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30b9\u30e0\u30fc\u30ba\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "\u4f4e\u3044\u4f4d\u7f6e\u306b\u914d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u5bfe\u8a71\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u81ea\u5206\u306b\u5408\u3063\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u8aad\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u3092\u884c\u3046\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

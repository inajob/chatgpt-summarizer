There are a lot of benefits, largely that it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry since it greatly reduces the need for expensive analog instruments. Its possible to get by with an impressively small computer and only a handful of other components too, as [BAussems] demonstrates with this tiny digital audio workstation (DAW).\nThe DAW is housed inside a small wooden box and is centered around a Behringer JT-4000 which does most of the heavy lifting in this project. Its a synthesizer designed to be as small as possible, but [BAussems] has a few other things to add to this build to round out its musical capabilities. A digital reverb effects pedal was disassembled to reduce size and added to the DAW beneath the synthesizer. At its most basic level this DAW can be used with nothing but these components and a pair of headphones, but its also possible to add a smartphone to act as a sequencer and a stereo as well.\nFor a portable on-the-go rig, this digital audio workstation checks a lot of the boxes needed including MIDI and integration with a computer. Its excellent inspiration for anyone else who needs a setup like this but doesnt have access, space, or funds for a more traditional laptop- or desktop-centered version. For some other small on-the-go musical instruments we recently saw a MIDI-enabled keyboard not much larger than a credit card.", "title": "\u30bf\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "1992\u5e74\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u53cb\u9054\u3084\u697d\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304c\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u8981\u6c42\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u524a\u6e1b\u3057\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3067DWA\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bf\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5c0f\u578b\u6728\u88fd\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u305f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u52d5\u5411", "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3092\u30b7\u30fc\u30b1\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "MIDI\u3084\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3068\u306e\u7d71\u5408\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3"]}

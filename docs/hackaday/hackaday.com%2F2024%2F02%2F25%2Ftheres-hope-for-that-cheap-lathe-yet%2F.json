The less you spend on a lathe, the closer you get to a lathe-shaped object and the further from, well, a lathe. [Camden Bowen] has bought a cheap lathe, and hes not content with a lathe-shaped object, so he takes us in the video below through a set of upgrades for it. In the process he makes a much nicer lathe for an entirely reasonable sum.\nFirst up are the bearings, in this case a set of ball races which arent really appropriate for taking lateral force. After a lot of effort and a tiny bit of damage he manages to remove the old bearings and get the new ones in place, though their slightly different dimensions means he has to replace a spacer with a temporary 3D printed item which hell turn in metal later. We learn quite a bit about cheap lathe tools and tool alignment along the way, and he ends up buying a better tool post to solve some of its problems. We were always not very good at grinding HSS edges, too.\nAt the end of it all he has a much better lathe, upping cost from $774 to $1062 which is still pretty good for what he has. Worth a look, if you too have a lathe-shaped object.\n\n", "title": "\u5b89\u3044\u65cb\u76e4\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u5b89\u7269\u306e\u65cb\u76e4\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u60aa\u304f\u3001\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u30843D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u306e\u5229\u7528\u306a\u3069\u88fd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u5411\u4e0a\u3002\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3082$774\u304b\u3089$1062\u306b\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u683c\u5b89\u3068\u8003\u3048\u308b\u4fa1\u5024\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u5b89\u3044\u65cb\u76e4\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u65b9\uff1a\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\uff1a\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u65cb\u76e4\u306e\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5", "\u4e88\u7b97$774\u304b\u3089$1062\uff1a\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u65cb\u76e4\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b", "\u65cb\u76e4\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff1a\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65cb\u76e4\u3092\u4f53\u9a13"]}

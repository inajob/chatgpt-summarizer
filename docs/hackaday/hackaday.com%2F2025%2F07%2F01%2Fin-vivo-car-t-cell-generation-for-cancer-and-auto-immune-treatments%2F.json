This is especially true for therapies involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which so far required a cumbersome process of extracting the patients T cells, modifying them ex vivo and returning the now CAR T cells to the patients body. After a recently published study, it seems that we may see in vivo\u00a0 CAR T cell therapy become reality, with all the ease of getting a vaccine shot.\nWe covered CAR T cells previously in the context of a way to prevent T cell exhaustion and making them more effective against certain tumors. This new study (paywalled) by [Theresa L. Hunter] et al. as published in Science demonstrates performing the CAR manipulation in vivo using CD8+ T cell targeting lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA to reprogram these T cells directly.\nIn rodent and non-human primate studies a clear effect on tumor control was demonstrated, with for auto-immune diseases the related B cells becoming effectively depleted. Although its still a long way off from human trials and market approval, this research builds upon the knowledge gained from existing mRNA vaccines, raising hopes that one day auto-immune or cancer therapy could be as simple as getting a cheap, standardized shot.", "title": "**CAR T\u7d30\u80de\u6cbb\u7642\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5c55\uff1a\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u624b\u8efd\u3055\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3078**", "body": "\u514d\u75ab\u7642\u6cd5\u306eCAR T\u7d30\u80de\u304c\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u7c21\u4fbf\u306b\u5b9f\u65bd\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u9032\u5c55\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["**CAR T\u7d30\u80de\u6cbb\u7642\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5c55\uff1a\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u624b\u8efd\u3055\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3078**", "**\u514d\u75ab\u7642\u6cd5\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1ain vivo\u3067\u306eCAR T\u7d30\u80de\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027**", "**mRNA\u30ca\u30ce\u7c92\u5b50\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3093\u6cbb\u7642\u6cd5\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c**", "**\u81ea\u52d5\u514d\u75ab\u75be\u60a3\u306e\u6cbb\u7642\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305fCAR T\u7d30\u80de\u306e\u76f4\u63a5\u6539\u5909**", "**\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u6cbb\u7642\u6cd5\uff1a\u304c\u3093\u3068\u81ea\u52d5\u514d\u75ab\u75be\u60a3\u3078\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1**"]}

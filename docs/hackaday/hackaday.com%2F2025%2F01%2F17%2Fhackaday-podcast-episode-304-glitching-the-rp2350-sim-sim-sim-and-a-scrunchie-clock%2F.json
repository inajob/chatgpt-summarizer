We started off talking about Hackaday Europe, which is coming up in March  seems unlikely that its just around the corner, but there it is. Theres also good news: the Hack Chat is back, and we started things off with a bang as Eben Upton stopped by to talk all things Pi. Separately, we talked about fault injection attacks, including how to find the hidden cup of\u00a0 0xC0FFEE in an RP2350.\nWe saw a very cool piece of LED jewelry that does a fluid simulation, a direct conversion radio thats all laid out in front of you, and the scrunchiest mechanical digital clock youll ever see. We saw blinkenlights for blinkenlights sake, all the ways to put threads in your prints, and how to ditch to coax and wire up your antennas with Cat 6 cable. Plus, its an Al Williams twofer in the Cant-Miss Articles, with a look back at life before GPS and how you can tune into digital ham radio, no radio required.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload the zero-calorie MP3.\n\nEpisode 304 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Europe 2025 Tickets On Sale, and CFP Extended Until Friday\nEben Upton Hack Chat Transcript\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [Egon] for getting the Ross ice shelf, and not some sci-fi computer at all.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nAll The Attacks On The RP2350\nA Direct Conversion Receiver Anyone Can Build\n\nAmateur Radio Homebrewing Hack Chat\nMake Your Own Variable Inductor\nDIY Tuning Capacitors From Washers And 3D-Printed Parts\nA Variable Capacitor For Not A Lot\n\n\nFluid Simulation Pendant Teaches Lessons In Miniaturization\nUsing The ESP8266 For Low-Cost Fault Injection\nComparing Ways To Add Threads To Your 3D Prints\nSprings And Things Make For A Unique Timepiece\n\nUnique Clock Finally Unites Hackers And Sequins\n\n\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nAvian-Inspired Drones: How Studying Birds Of Prey Brings More Efficient Drones Closer\nAudio On A Shoestring: DIY Your Own Studio-Grade Mic\nSecond CNC Machine Is Twice As Nice\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nForget The Coax, Wire Up Your Antennas With Cat 6 Cable\nProcedurally Generated Terrain In OpenSCAD\nBlinkenlights-First Retrocomputer Design\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nBefore GPS There Was LORAN\nNo Ham License?

Theyre largely absent from our modern lives, but [Arnov Sharma] is bringing them back. After all, who doesnt want a cool visualizer hanging on the wall in their living room?\nThe build is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. Its paired with a small microphone hooked up to a MAX9814 chip, which amplifies the signal and offers automatic gain control to boot. This is a particularly useful feature, which allows the microphone to pick up very soft and very loud sounds without the output clipping. The Pi Pico 2 picks up the signals from the mic, and then displays the waveforms on a 64 x 32 HUB75 RGB matrix. Its a typical scope-type display, which allows one to visualize the sound waves quite easily. [Arnov] demonstrates this by playing tones on a guitar, and its easy to see the corresponding waveforms playing out on the LED screen.\nIts a fun project, and its wrapped up in a slick 3D printed housing. This turns the visualizer into a nice responsive piece of wall art that would suit any hackers decor. Weve featured some other great visualizers before, too. \n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u304a\u3057\u3083\u308c\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc", "body": "Arnov Sharma\u304cRaspberry Pi Pico 2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u6ce2\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u304a\u3057\u3083\u308c\u306a\u97f3\u58f0\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u97f3\u306e\u6ce2\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8", "- MAX9814\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u97f3\u58f0\u53ef\u8996\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u58c1\u639b\u3051\u578b\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u751f\u6d3b\u7a7a\u9593\u3092\u5f69\u308b", "- \u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u97f3\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\uff01\u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

Theyre largely absent from our modern lives, but [Arnov Sharma] is bringing them back. After all, who doesnt want a cool visualizer hanging on the wall in their living room?\nThe build is based around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. Its paired with a small microphone hooked up to a MAX9814 chip, which amplifies the signal and offers automatic gain control to boot. This is a particularly useful feature, which allows the microphone to pick up very soft and very loud sounds without the output clipping. The Pi Pico 2 picks up the signals from the mic, and then displays the waveforms on a 64 x 32 HUB75 RGB matrix. Its a typical scope-type display, which allows one to visualize the sound waves quite easily. [Arnov] demonstrates this by playing tones on a guitar, and its easy to see the corresponding waveforms playing out on the LED screen.\nIts a fun project, and its wrapped up in a slick 3D printed housing. This turns the visualizer into a nice responsive piece of wall art that would suit any hackers decor. Weve featured some other great visualizers before, too. \n"}

Colors as numbers can be used outside resistors, for example in a clock, as [Det Builds Stuff] shows us with an ESP32 TFT dev board.\nIts fair to say that this is more of a software project than a hardware one, but thats not necessarily a bad thing as he takes us though the process of creating a Network Time Protocol (NTP) capable clock with the dev board. He claims it may be the worlds first resistor clock, something wed have to disagree with, but beside that we can see this could make a neat little desk ornament with a 3D printed case.\nOddly though, wed expect older engineers to face the same steep learning curve as younger ones when reading it, because its easier to recognize visual sequences of numbers as preferred resistor values than it is to visually decode each one every time.\n\n"}

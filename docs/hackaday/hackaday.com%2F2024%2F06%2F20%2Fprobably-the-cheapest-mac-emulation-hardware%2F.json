But the Mac has been around for a very long time now, and its earliest incarnation only has 128k of RAM and a 68000 processor. What can emulate one of those? Along comes [Matt Evans], with a working Mac 128k emulated on a Raspberry Pi Pico. Such is the power of a modern microcontroller that an RP2040 can now be a Mac!\nThe granddaddy of all Macs might have been a computer to lust after four decades ago, but the reality was that even at the time the demands of a GUI quickly made it under-powered. The RP2040 has plenty of processing power compared to the 68000 and over twice the Macs memory, so it seemed as though emulating the one with the other might be possible. This proved to be the case, using the Musashi 68000 interpreter and a self-built emulator which has been spun into a project of its own called umac. With monochrome VGA and USB for keyboard and mouse, theres MacPaint on a small LCD screen looking a lot like the real thing.\nIf you want a 1980s Mac for anything without the joy of reviving original hardware, this represents an extremely cheap way to achieve it. If it can be compiled for microcontrollers with more available memory we could see it would even make for a more useful Mac, though your Mac mileage may vary.\nOf course, this isnt the only take on an early Mac weve brought you.", "title": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bMac 128k\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "body": "Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Macintosh 128k\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002Musashi 68000\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001Monochrome VGA\u3068USB\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3088\u308a\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044Mac\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bMac 128k\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "RP2040\u306b\u3088\u308bMac 128k\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "RP2040\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fMac 128k\u518d\u73fe", "Mac 128k\u306e\u518d\u73fe: Raspberry Pi Pico\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eMac\u3092Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u518d\u73fe"]}

[Vals Virtuals] managed to improve fitment even more by redesigning a facial interface and using a 3D scan of ones own head to fine-tune the result even further. The new designs distribute weight more evenly while also providing an optional flip-up connection.\n\nIt may be true that only a minority of people own a Bigscreen Beyond headset, and even fewer of them are willing to DIY their own custom facial interface. But [Val]s workflow and directions for using Blender to combine a 3D scan of ones face with his redesigned parts to create a custom-fitted, foam-lined facial interface is good reading, and worth keeping in mind for anyone who designs wearables that could benefit from custom fitting. Its all spelled out in the projects documentation  look for the .txt file among the 3D models.\nWeve seen a variety of DIY approaches to VR hardware, from nearly scratch-built headsets to lens experiments, and one thing thats clear is that better comfort is always an improvement. With newer iPhones able to do 3D scanning and 1:1 scale scanning in general becoming more accessible, we have a feeling were going to see more of this DIY approach to ultra-customization.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u624b\u8efd\u3067\u8efd\u91cf\u306aVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300cBigscreen Beyond\u300d\u306f\u3001\u9854\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306f\u91cd\u91cf\u3092\u5747\u7b49\u306b\u5206\u6563\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u63a5\u7d9a\u3082\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002DIY\u5411\u3051\u306eBlender\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5", "VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u6539\u9020: 3D\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5feb\u9069\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u660e\u8a18: Blender\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u500b\u5225\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210", "DIY\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba: wearables\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

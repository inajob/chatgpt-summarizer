The post is in Japanese, but the video is very much show, dont tell and its perfectly clear how it all works. The results look fantastic!\nSuited to filming small subjects.\nThe device consists of a frame that forms a sort of enclosed track in which ones mobile phone can slide horizontally. The phone butts up against the plunger of an ordinary syringe built into the frame. As the phone is pushed along, it depresses the plunger which puts up enough resistance to turn the phones slide into a slow, even, and smooth glide. Want to fine-tune the resistance and therefore the performance? Simply attach different diameter tips to the syringe.\nThe results speak for themselves, and its a fantastically clever bit of work. There are plenty of DIY slider designs (some of which get amazingly complex) but they are rarely small things that can be easily gotten up close and personal with small subjects like mini train terrain.\n\n\n\u300c\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u300d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6ed1\u3089\u304b\u64ae\u5f71\u30c6\u30af\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\uff01\u67a0\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u3068\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3092\u53ce\u3081\u3001\u3044\u308d\u3093\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u3067\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u52d5\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\u52d5\u753b10\u79d2\u76ee\u304b\u3089\u306e\u4f5c\u4f8b\u3082\u305c\u3072\u898b\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01#\u9244\u9053\u6a21\u578b #N\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8 #B\u30c8\u30ec #\u30b8\u30aa\u30e9\u30de pic.twitter.com/57uVTeHOxq\n B\u4f5c (@Btoretsukuru) September 24, 2024\n"}

Hes got one but it needed some tender loving care, and you can see how he approaches a restoration like this in the video below.\nThe radio was actually in better shape physically than most of the old radios we see. It wasnt perfect, but it looked good on the outside. Electrically, though, it did need some work, and the dial had problems, too. The first obstacle was identifying exactly the model of the radio since there were a number of Sultan radios produced.\n\nArmed with the correct model number, he could find the service documentation. The radio apparently was made for the international market because the service information was in both English and German. It also had a transformer you could configure for different line voltages.\nThe insides didnt look too bad, either, although the old printed circuit board was brittle. This video is just part 1 of the troubleshooting and we hope to see some more video soon. But it was great to see inside what looked like a premium tube radio from the 1960s and we cant wait to hear it working again.\n", "title": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3001Blaupunkt Sultan 24300\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306b\u88fd\u9020\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30d7\u30f3\u30af\u30c8\u30b9\u30eb\u30bf\u30f324300\u306f\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e1\u3064\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u4fee\u5fa9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306f\u5916\u898b\u306f\u826f\u597d\u3067\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u3068\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u306b\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6b63\u3057\u3044\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u756a\u53f7\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u5f8c\u3001\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u5165\u624b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5185\u90e8\u3082\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u60aa\u304f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u57fa\u677f\u306f\u8106\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u4fee\u5fa9\u306e\u69d8\u5b50\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u304c\u9ad8\u307e\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u3001Blaupunkt Sultan 24300\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u65b9\u6cd5", "Sultan 24300\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u4fee\u5fa9\u3068\u5916\u89b3\u6539\u4fee", "\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u516c\u958b\uff01Blaupunkt Sultan 24300\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u82f1\u8a9e\u3068\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u8a9e\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fBlaupunkt Sultan 24300\u306e\u56fd\u969b\u5e02\u5834\u5411\u3051\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u611f\u6e80\u8f09\u306e1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eBlaupunkt Sultan 24300\u306e\u5fa9\u65e7\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059"]}

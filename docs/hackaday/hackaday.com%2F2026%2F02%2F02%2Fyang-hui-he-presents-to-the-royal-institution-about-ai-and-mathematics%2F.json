He says that right now AI is poised to change the very nature of how mathematics is done. He is part of a community of hundreds of mathematicians pursuing the use of AI for research purposes.\n[Yang-Hui He] traces the genesis of the term artificial intelligence to a research proposal from J. McCarthy, M.L. Minsky, N. Rochester, and C.E. Shannon dated August 31, 1955. He says that his mantra has become: connectivism leads to emergence, and goes on to explain what he means by that, then follows with universal approximation theorems.\nHe goes on to enumerate some of the key moments in AI: Descartess b\u00eate-machine, 1617; Lovelaces speculation, 1842; Turing test, 1949; Dartmouth conference, 1956; Rosenblatts Perceptron, 1957; Hopfields network, 1982; Hintons Boltzmann machine, 1984; IBMs Deep Blue, 1997; and DeepMinds AlphaGo, 2012.\nHe continues with some navel-gazing about what is mathematics, and what is artificial intelligence. He considers how we do mathematics as bottom-up, top-down, or meta-mathematics. He mentions about one of his earliest papers on the subject Machine-learning the string landscape (PDF) and his books The Calabi\u2013Yau Landscape: From Geometry, to Physics, to Machine Learning and Machine Learning in Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.\nHe goes on to explain about Mathlib and the Xena Project. He discusses Machine-Assisted Proof by Terence Tao (PDF) and goes on to talk more about the history of mathematics and particularly experimental mathematics. All in all a very interesting talk, if you can find a spare hour!\nIn conclusion: Has AI solved any major open conjecture? No. Is AI beginning to help to advance mathematical discovery? Yes. Has AI changed the speakers day-to-day research routine? Yes and no.\nIf youre interested in more fun math articles be sure to check out Digital Paint Mixing Has Been Greatly Improved With 1930s Math and Painted Over But Not Forgotten: Restoring Lost Paintings With Radiation And Mathematics.\n\n", "title": "- AI\u304c\u6570\u5b66\u306b\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\uff1aYang-Hui He\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14", "body": "AI\u304c\u7d14\u7c8b\u6570\u5b66\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u3092\u4fc3\u9032\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u8b1b\u6f14\u3002", "titles": ["- AI\u304c\u6570\u5b66\u306b\u9769\u547d\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\uff1aYang-Hui He\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14", "- \u6570\u5b66\u3068\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\uff1a\u9032\u5c55\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "- AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u6a5f\u68b0\u5b66\u7fd2\u3068\u6570\u5b66\u306e\u4ea4\u5dee\u70b9\uff1aYang-Hui He\u306e\u898b\u89e3", "- \u6570\u5b66\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3059\u308bAI: \u73fe\u72b6\u3068\u5c55\u671b"]}

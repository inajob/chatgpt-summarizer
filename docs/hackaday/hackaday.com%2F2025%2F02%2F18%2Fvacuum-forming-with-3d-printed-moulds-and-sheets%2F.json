Weve created our own vacuum forms on 3D printed moulds for ages, so its interesting to see [Pisces Printing ] following the same path. But what you might not realize at first is that the vacuum forming sheets themselves are also 3D printed.\nThe full video is below the break, and in it he details making a mould from PETG, and in particular designing it for easy release. The part hes making is a belt guard for a table top lathe, and the PETG sheet hes forming it from is also 3D printed. He makes the point that its by no means perfect, for example he shows us a bit of layer separation, but it seems promising enough for further experimentation.\u00a0 His vacuum forming setup seems particularly small, which looks as though it makes the job of making a sheet somewhat simpler.\nThe cost of a vacuum forming sheet of whichever polymer is hardly high, so we cant see this technique making sense for everyday use. But as weve seen in previous experiments, the printed sheets so make it easy to add color and texture to the final product, which obviously adds some value to the technique.\n\n\nThanks [Tomas Harvie Mudrunka] for the tip."}

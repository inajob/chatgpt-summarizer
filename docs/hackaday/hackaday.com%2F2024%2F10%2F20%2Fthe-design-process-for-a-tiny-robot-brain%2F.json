If not, we can at least build them for less cost. But the design process can get exponentially more complicated when miniaturizing things. [Carl] wanted to build the smallest 9-axis robotic microcontroller with as many features as possible, and went through a number of design iterations to finally get to this extremely small robotics platform.\nAlthough there are smaller wireless-enabled microcontrollers, [Carl] based this project around the popular ESP32 platform to allow it to be usable by a wider range of people. With that module taking up most of the top side of the PCB, he turned to the bottom to add the rest of the components for the platform. The first thing to add was a power management circuit, and after one iteration he settled on a circuit which can provide the board power from a battery or a USB cable, while also managing the batterys charge. As for sensors, it has a light sensor and an optional 9-axis motion sensor, allowing for gesture sensing, proximity detection, and motion tracking.\nOf course there were some compromises in this design to minimize the footprint, like placing the antenna near the USB-C charger and sacrificing some processing power compared to other development boards like the STM-32. But for the size and cost of components its hard to get so many features in such a small package. [Carl] is using it to build some pretty tiny robots so it suits his needs perfectly. In fact, its hard to find anything smaller that isnt a bristlebot.\n\n", "title": "\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u75289\u8ef8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "body": "\u6280\u8853\u304c\u9032\u3080\u306b\u3064\u308c\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3088\u308a\u591a\u304f\u306e\u51e6\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u53ce\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u74b0\u5883\u3068\u5bfe\u8a71\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002\u6700\u5c0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e9\u8ef8\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u904e\u7a0b\u304c\u8907\u96d1\u5316\u3059\u308b\u304c\u3001ESP32\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u75289\u8ef8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "ESP32\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0", "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9", "\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8a2d\u8a08\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3057\u305f\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

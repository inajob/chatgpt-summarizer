From what we hear, it\u2019s all-hands-on over in Pasadena right now, as everyone is putting the finishing touches on preparations for Hackadays annual\u00a0 US gathering.\nWe\u2019ve been heads-down in the badge for a little while, and between that and all of the logistics, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the work. And then we saw this video that [InstantArcade] shot, just casually walking through the event a couple years back. It\u2019s not particularly a highlights reel, but seeing so many of the people I recognized, and remembering the many fantastic conversations we\u2019d had. So much energy, interest, and simple excitement in sharing stories, what they\u2019re working on, or just what they\u2019ve seen lately that blew their mind.\nThere is no substitute for being there in person, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to try! We\u2019ll be putting the talks up on our YouTube channel next Saturday, and as always, you\u2019re invited to join in the discussion on our Discord server both during the event and whenever. If you\u2019re not going to be there in the alley, join us virtually!\nWe\u2019ll be meeting up Thursday night at 7:00 pm at King\u2019s Row for an informal pre-meetup. Bring a hack if you\u2019ve got something to share! Then things start for real on Friday morning over at Supplyframe HQ. We\u2019ll talk badges, get to know each other, and just nerd out and chill. (I love Fridays!) Halloween / sci-fi costume party Friday night, get some sleep, and head on over to the LACM and Design Lab for two tracks of talks and a full day on Saturday going late into the night. And as usual, the change back to standard time gets you an extra hour of sleep so that you\u2019re rested and ready for Sunday.\nThere is still a lot to do behind the scenes, but seeing you all there makes it more than worth it! See you at Supercon.\n(Oh, and no newsletter next week, but you can spend all day Saturday and Sunday watching the talks. That makes up for it, right?)\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks. It also includes our favorite articles from the last seven days that you can see on the web version of the newsletter.\n\nWant this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning?

Take [maurycyz]s radiation survey meter modifications, for instance; were not sure why such a thing is needed, but were pretty glad we stumbled across it.\nTo be fair, [maurycyz] does give us a hint of whats going on here by choosing the classic Ludlum Model 3 to modify. Built like a battleship, these meters would be great for field prospecting except that the standard G-M tube isnt sensitive to gamma rays, the only kind of radiation likely not to be attenuated by soil. A better choice is a scintillation tube, but those greatly increase the background readings, making it hard to tease a signal from the noise.\nTo get around this problem and make rockhounding a little more enjoyable, [maurycyz] added a little digital magic to the mostly analog Ludlum. An AVR128 microcontroller taps into the stream of events the meter measures via the scintillation tube, and a little code subtracts the background radiation from the current count rate, translating the difference into an audible tone. This keeps [maurycyz]s eyes on the rocks rather than on the meter needle, and makes it easier to find weakly radioactive or deeply buried specimens.\nIf youre not ready to make the leap to a commercial survey meter, or if you just want to roll your own, weve got plenty of examples to choose from, from minimalist to cyberpunkish.", "title": "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\uff01\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "[maurycyz]\u306f\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u653e\u5c04\u3092\u88dc\u6b63\u3057\u97f3\u3067\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\uff01\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u5730\u8cea\u5b66\u9451\u5b9a\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u6a5f\u80fd\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0", "- AVE128\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u63a1\u77f3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u30b5\u30fc\u30d9\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u9020\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

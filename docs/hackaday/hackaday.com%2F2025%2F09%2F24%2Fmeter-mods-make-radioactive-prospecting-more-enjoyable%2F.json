Take [maurycyz]s radiation survey meter modifications, for instance; were not sure why such a thing is needed, but were pretty glad we stumbled across it.\nTo be fair, [maurycyz] does give us a hint of whats going on here by choosing the classic Ludlum Model 3 to modify. Built like a battleship, these meters would be great for field prospecting except that the standard G-M tube isnt sensitive to gamma rays, the only kind of radiation likely not to be attenuated by soil. A better choice is a scintillation tube, but those greatly increase the background readings, making it hard to tease a signal from the noise.\nTo get around this problem and make rockhounding a little more enjoyable, [maurycyz] added a little digital magic to the mostly analog Ludlum. An AVR128 microcontroller taps into the stream of events the meter measures via the scintillation tube, and a little code subtracts the background radiation from the current count rate, translating the difference into an audible tone. This keeps [maurycyz]s eyes on the rocks rather than on the meter needle, and makes it easier to find weakly radioactive or deeply buried specimens.\nIf youre not ready to make the leap to a commercial survey meter, or if you just want to roll your own, weve got plenty of examples to choose from, from minimalist to cyberpunkish."}

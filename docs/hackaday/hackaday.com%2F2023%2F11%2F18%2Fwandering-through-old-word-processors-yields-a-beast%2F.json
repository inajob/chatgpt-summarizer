Today, word processors and digital documents are so ubiquitous that they are hardly worth a thought, but that didnt happen all at once. [Cathode Ray Dude] has a soft spot for old word processors and the journey they took over decades, and he walks through the Olivetti ETV 2700.\nIn the days of character displays and no multitasking, WYSIWYG as a concept was still a long ways off.\nThe ETV 2700 is a monstrous machine; a fusion of old-school word processor, x86-based hardware, and electric 17 inch-wide typewriter.\nWith it one could boot up a word processor that is nothing like the WYSIWYG of today, write and edit a document, and upon command, the typewriter portion could electronically type out a page. A bit like a printer, but it really is an electric typewriter with a computer interface. Characters were hammered out one at a time with daisy wheel and ink ribbon on a manually-loaded page using all the usual typewriter controls.\nWhile internally the machine has an x86 processor, expects a monitor and even boots MS-DOS, the keyboard had its own layout (and even proprietary keys and functions), did not support graphical output, and in other ways was unusual even by the standards of the oddball decades during which designers and products experimented with figuring out what worked best in terms of functionality and usability.\nNowadays, we see AI-enabled typewriter projects and porting vintage OSes to vintage word processor hardware, but such projects are in some part possible in part thanks to the durability of these devices. The entire video is embedded below, but you can jump directly to what the Olivetti ETV 2700 looked like on the inside if thats what interests you most.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u77e5\u308d\u3046", "body": "\u30aa\u30ea\u30d9\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3ETV 2700\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u77e5\u308d\u3046", "\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3068\u96fb\u6c17\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "WYSIWYG\u4ee5\u524d\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u6b74\u53f2", "\u96fb\u5b50\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9", "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\uff1aOlivetti ETV 2700\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

Sometimes though, you want remote control for your own purposes, and thats what [ABy] achieved. Hes got a HP ProDesk 600 G3 Mini, decided to put it into a hard to reach spot in his flat, somewhere you couldnt easily fetch a monitor and a keyboard for any debugging needs. So, he started looking into some sort of remote access option in case hed need to access the BIOS remotely, and went as far as it took to make it work. (Google Translate)\nThe features he needed are covered by Intel AMT  specifically, BIOS access over a WiFi connection. However, his mini PC only had SMT enabled from the factory, the cut-down version of AMT without features like wireless support. He figured out that BIOS dumping was the way, promptly did just that, found a suitable set of tools for his ME region version, and enabled AMT using Intels FIT (Flash Image Tool) software.\n\nNow, dumping the image could be done from a running system fully through software, but apparently, flashing back requires an external programmer. He went with the classic CH341, did the 3.3 V voltmod thats required to make it safe for flash chip use, and proceeded to spend a good amount of time making it work. Something about the process was screwy, likely the proprietary CH341 software. Comments under the article highlight that you should use flashrom for these tasks, and indeed, you should.\nThis article goes into a ton of detail when it comes to working with Intel BIOS images  whichever kind of setting you want to change, be it AMT support or some entirely different but just as tasty setting, you will be well served by this write-up. Comments do point out that you might want to upgrade the Intel ME version while at it, and for what its worth, you can look into disabling it too; weve shown you a multitude of reasons why you should, and a good few ways you could.", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30ebME\u3068AMT: \u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Intel\u306eME\u3001AMT\u3001SMT\u3001V-Pro\u306f\u3001\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u6280\u8853\u306b\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Operating System\u3088\u308a\u3082\u6df1\u304fIntel\u306eCPU\u306b\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002ABy\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001HP ProDesk 600 G3 Mini\u3092\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c8\u30a5\u30ea\u30fc\u30c1\u306a\u5834\u6240\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3057\u3001BIOS\u306b\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u3053\u3067\u3001BIOS\u30c0\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066AMT\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u306b\u3057\u3001CH341\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u884c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Intel ME\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 (Google Translate)\n\n", "titles": ["\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30ebME\u3068AMT: \u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3082BIOS\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "CH341\u3067\u306eBIOS\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5: \u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u624b\u9806\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Intel ME\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9: \u52b9\u679c\u3068\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\uff01", "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30ebME\u306e\u7121\u52b9\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5: \u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3068\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8003\u5bdf"]}

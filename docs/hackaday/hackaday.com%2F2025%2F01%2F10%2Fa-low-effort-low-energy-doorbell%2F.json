However, it can drain batteries which is one reason Bluetooth Low Energy  BLE  exists. [Drmph] shows how easy it is to deploy BLE to make, in this case, a doorbell. He even shows how you can refit an existing doorbell to use the newer technology.\nLike many projects, this one started out of necessity. The existing wireless doorbell failed, but it was difficult to find a new unit with good review. Cheap doorbells tend to ring spuriously due to interference. BLE, of course, doesnt have that problem. Common BLE modules make up the bulk of the project. It is easy enough to add your own style to the doorbell like a voice announcement or musical playback. The transmitter is little more than a switch, the module, a coin cell, and an LED.\nIt is, of course, possible to have a single receiver read multiple doorbells. For example, a front door and back door with different tones. The post shows how to make a remote monitor, too, if you need the bell to ring beyond the range of BLE.\nA fun, simple, and useful project. Of course, the cool doorbells now have video. Just be careful not to get carried away.", "title": "- BLE\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "body": "BLE\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["- BLE\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "- \u7701\u30a8\u30cdBluetooth\u3067\u7121\u7dda\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u3092BLE\u306b\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u8907\u6570\u306e\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u7ba1\u7406\u3059\u308bBLE\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cBLE\u30c9\u30a2\u30d9\u30eb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

But sometimes its a piece of electronics were not quite ready to let go, and something has to be fixed. Chris Greening had a board just like that, a 27 volt generator from an LCD panel, and he crafted a new circuit for it.\nThe original circuit (which we think he may have drawn incorrectly), uses a small boost converter IC with the expected inductor and diode. His replacement is the tried and tested joule thief, but with a much higher base resistor than its normal application in simply maintaining a battery voltage. It sucks 10 mA from the battery and is regulated with a Zener diode, but theres still further room for improvement. Adding an extra transistor and using the Zener as a feedback component causes the oscillator to shut off as the voltage increases, something which in this application is fine.\nIts interesting to see a joule thief pushed into a higher voltage application like this, but we sense perhaps it could be made more efficient by seeking out an equivalent to the boost converter chip. Or even a flyback converter.", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u4fee\u7406\uff1a27\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u751f", "body": "Chris Greening\u306fLCD\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e27V\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3002\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30d5\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u52b9\u7387\u6539\u5584\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u4fee\u7406\uff1a27\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u751f", "- \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30d5\u56de\u8def\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u5909\u63db\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5", "- \u58ca\u308c\u305f\u56de\u8def\u3092\u4fee\u6b63\u3059\u308b\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u3068\u6539\u5584\u70b9", "- \u30bc\u30ca\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u306e\u6280\u8853", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u96fb\u6e90\u8a2d\u8a08\uff1a\u30d6\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u63a2\u6c42"]}

This inability to accurately represent pi is just one of the ways in which these systems resemble a computer, a similarity that [0x0mer] explored in CasNum.\nThe core of the program represents operations with a drawing compass and unmarked straightedge. There are only a few operations that can be used for calculation: constructing a line through two points, constructing a circle centered at one point and intersecting another point, and constructing the intersection(s) of two lines, a line and a circle, or two circles. An optional viewer visualizes these operations. Another class builds on top of this basic environment to perform arithmetic and logical operations, representing numbers as points in the Cartesian plane. To add two numbers, for example, it constructs the midpoint between them, then doubles the distance from the origin.\nThere are some examples available, including the RSA algorithm. [0x0mer] also altered a Game Boy emulator to implement the ALU instructions using compass and straightedge operations. In testing, it took about fifteen minutes to boot, and runs at a \u201ctotally almost playable\u201d speed, near one FPS. This is after extensive caching has been applied to minimize computation time; the performance here is impressive, but in a more qualitative than quantitative sense.\nBeing virtual, this system is discrete, but a physical compass and straightedge form a simple analog computer capable of dealing with continuous values.", "title": "- \u5186\u3068\u5e73\u65b9\u306e\u9762\u7a4d\u3092\u7b49\u3057\u304f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1882\u5e74\u306e\u767a\u898b", "body": "\u5186\u3092\u63cf\u304f\u306e\u306f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3068\u3055\u308c\u30011882\u5e74\u306b\u8a3c\u660e\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u3068\u5b9a\u898f\u3067\u306e\u8a08\u7b97\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5186\u3068\u5e73\u65b9\u306e\u9762\u7a4d\u3092\u7b49\u3057\u304f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1882\u5e74\u306e\u767a\u898b", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u3068\u5b9a\u898f\u3067\u8a08\u7b97\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u306e\u63a2\u6c42", "- \u6570\u5b57\u3092\u70b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6271\u3046\uff01\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- RSA\u6697\u53f7\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9\u3068\u5b9a\u898f\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3092\u8996\u899a\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

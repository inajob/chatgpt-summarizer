The game isnt trivial, but the rules are managably simple. However, the game is too complex to be easily solved entirely, so you have to use tricky software to play a credible game. Big computers do have an advantage, of course. But Microchess  arguably the first commercial game for home computers  was able to play on tiny machines like the Kim-1. [Joachim Froholt] interviewed [Peter Jennings]  the man behind Microchess to learn the whole story of its creation.\nIn 1960, [Jennings] was ten years old and had to persuade the local librarian to let him read adult books on electronics and computers. Five years later, a ham radio teletype and some circuitry helped him practice chess openings and was the first of many chess-playing machines hed build or program.\nMicrochess itself took six months of painstaking programming, entering hex codes into the computer. Word leaked out from a users group meeting (where Microchess beat a human player), and [Jennings] was swamped with requests for the program. In late 1976, the program was offered for sale as a teletype listing or, for an extra $3, a cassette tape.\nThe program went on to be very successful and moved to other platforms. Commodore even made a special dedicated device based on the Kim-1 to play Microchess, a piece of hardware unique enough that [Michael Gardi] honored it with one of his phenomenal replicas."}

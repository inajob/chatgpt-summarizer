The game isnt trivial, but the rules are managably simple. However, the game is too complex to be easily solved entirely, so you have to use tricky software to play a credible game. Big computers do have an advantage, of course. But Microchess  arguably the first commercial game for home computers  was able to play on tiny machines like the Kim-1. [Joachim Froholt] interviewed [Peter Jennings]  the man behind Microchess to learn the whole story of its creation.\nIn 1960, [Jennings] was ten years old and had to persuade the local librarian to let him read adult books on electronics and computers. Five years later, a ham radio teletype and some circuitry helped him practice chess openings and was the first of many chess-playing machines hed build or program.\nMicrochess itself took six months of painstaking programming, entering hex codes into the computer. Word leaked out from a users group meeting (where Microchess beat a human player), and [Jennings] was swamped with requests for the program. In late 1976, the program was offered for sale as a teletype listing or, for an extra $3, a cassette tape.\nThe program went on to be very successful and moved to other platforms. Commodore even made a special dedicated device based on the Kim-1 to play Microchess, a piece of hardware unique enough that [Michael Gardi] honored it with one of his phenomenal replicas.", "title": "- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\uff1a\u521d\u306e\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "body": "\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6307\u6a19\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001Microchess\u306f\u521d\u306e\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002Jennings\u306f6\u30f6\u6708\u304b\u3051\u3066\u5236\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\uff1a\u521d\u306e\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b8\u30a7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u79d8\u8a71", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u5148\u99c6\u3051\u3001\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u6210\u529f\u3068\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u5c0f\u578b\u6a5f\u3067\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u30c1\u30a7\u30b9\u3092\u901a\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u6b74\u53f2"]}

Alternatively, you can roll your own like [arpy8] did, and keep your life a little more private.\nThe build is based around an ESP32 microcontroller. It connects to the net via its inbuilt Wi-Fi connection, and listens out for your voice with an INMP441 omnidirectional microphone module. The audio data is trucked off to a backend server running a Whisper speech-to-text model. The text is then passed to Googles Gemini 2.5 Flash large language model. The response generated is passed to the Piper Neural Voice text-to-speech engine, sent back to the ESP32, and spat out via the devices DAC output and a speaker attached to an LM386 amplifier. Basically, anything you could ask Gemini, you can do with this device.\nBy virtue of using a commercial large language model, its not perfectly private by any means. Still, its at least a little farther removed than using a smart speaker thats directly logged in to your Amazon/Google/Hulu/Beanstikk account. Files are on Github for those eager to dive into the code. Weve seen some other fun builds along these lines before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

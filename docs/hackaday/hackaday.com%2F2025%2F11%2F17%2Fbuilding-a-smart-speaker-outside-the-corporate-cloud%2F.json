Alternatively, you can roll your own like [arpy8] did, and keep your life a little more private.\nThe build is based around an ESP32 microcontroller. It connects to the net via its inbuilt Wi-Fi connection, and listens out for your voice with an INMP441 omnidirectional microphone module. The audio data is trucked off to a backend server running a Whisper speech-to-text model. The text is then passed to Googles Gemini 2.5 Flash large language model. The response generated is passed to the Piper Neural Voice text-to-speech engine, sent back to the ESP32, and spat out via the devices DAC output and a speaker attached to an LM386 amplifier. Basically, anything you could ask Gemini, you can do with this device.\nBy virtue of using a commercial large language model, its not perfectly private by any means. Still, its at least a little farther removed than using a smart speaker thats directly logged in to your Amazon/Google/Hulu/Beanstikk account. Files are on Github for those eager to dive into the code. Weve seen some other fun builds along these lines before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u91cd\u8996\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u3092\u8003\u616e\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u6a5f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u91cd\u8996\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- ESP32\u3068\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8", "- Whisper\u3068Gemini\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u97f3\u58f0\u5fdc\u7b54\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408", "- GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\uff01DIY\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u89e3\u8aac"]}

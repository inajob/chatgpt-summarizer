Unfortunately, between the small number produced, varying paper quality, and the destruction of World War II, few of these still survive. To keep more of these from being lost forever, a team at Bucknell University has been working on a digitization project, overcoming several technical challenges in the process. The biggest challenge was the varying physical layout of the film. These films were printed in short strips, then glued together by hand, creating minor irregularities every few feet; the width of the film varied enough to throw off most film scanners; even the indexing holes were in inconsistent places, sometimes at the top or bottom of the fame, and above or below the frame border. The team\u2019s solution was the Ky\u014drinrin scanner, named for a Japanese guardian spirit of lost papers. It uses two spools to run the lightly-tensioned film in front of a Blackmagic cinematic camera, taking a video of the continuously-moving film. To avoid damaging the film, the scanner contacts it in as few places as possible.After taking the video, the team used a program they had written to recognize and extract still images of the individual frames, then aligned the frames and combined them into a watchable film. The team\u2019s presented the digitized films at a number of locations, but if you\u2019d like to see a quick sample, several of them are available on YouTube (one of which is embedded below). This piece\u2019s tipster pointed out some similarities to another recent article on another form of paper-based image encoding. If you don\u2019t need to work with paper, we\u2019ve also seen ways to scan film more accurately.\n\n\nThanks to [Yet Another Robert Smith] for the tip!"}

Thus we end up with for example AliExpress sellers offering their own versions that can be significantly cheaper than the genuine article. The ones that that [electronupdate] obtained for a test and decapping session cost just $2.25 a pop.\n\nAs can be seen in the top image, the board from AliExpress misses the Raspberry Pi logo on the silkscreen for obvious reasons, but otherwise appears to feature an identical component layout. The QSPI Flash IC is marked on the die as BY250156FS, identifying it as a Boya part.\nNiggles about flash ROM quality aside, whats perhaps most interesting about this teardown is what eagle-eyed commentators spotted on the die shot of the RP2040. Although on the MCU the laser markings identify the RP2040 as a B2 stepping, the die clearly identifies it as an RP2 B0 part, meaning B0 stepping. This can be problematic when you try to use the USB functionality due to hardware USB bugs in the B0 and B1 steppings.\nAs they say, caveat emptor.\n\n", "title": "- RP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01AliExpress\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "body": "RP2040\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u5b89\u4fa1\u306b\u8ca9\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u54c1\u8cea\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- RP2040\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01AliExpress\u3067\u306e\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u306e\u8907\u88fd\uff1a\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u9078\u629e\u80a2", "- AliExpress\u306eRP2040\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\uff01\u54c1\u8cea\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306f\uff1f", "- RP2040\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u554f\u984c\uff1aUSB\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- \u4e2d\u83ef\u88fdRP2040\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\uff1a\u771f\u8d0b\u4e0d\u660e\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\uff01"]}

From there theyll talk about the surprisingly high-tech world of vapes, a flying DeLorean several years in the making, non-contact pulse monitoring, and the potential of backyard radio telescopes to do real astronomy. Youll hear about a dodecahedron speaker, a page turning peripheral, and 3D printed tools for unfolding boxes. Theyll wrap things up by taking a look at the latest generation of wearable smart glasses, and wonder if putting a bank of batteries in your home is really with the hassle.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDirect download in DRM-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 339 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\n2025 Hackaday Superconference: Announcing Our Workshops And Tickets\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nThink you know that sound?

Even once you understand this, designing a circuit with impedance matching is a tricky task, and it\u2019s here that [Ralph Gable]\u2019s introduction to impedance matching is helpful.\nThe goal of impedance matching is to maximize the amount of power transmitted from a source to a load. In some simple situations, resistance is the only significant component in impedance, and it\u2019s possible to match impedance just by matching resistance. In most situations, though, capacitance and inductance will add a reactive component to the impedance, in which case it becomes necessary to use the complex conjugate for impedance matching.\nThe video goes over this theory briefly, but it\u2019s real focus is on explaining how to read a Smith chart, an intimidating-looking tool which can be used to calculate impedances. The video covers the basic impedance-only Smith chart, as well as a full-color Smith chart which indicates both impedance and admittance.\nThis video is the introduction to a planned series on impedance matching, and beyond reading Smith charts, it doesn\u2019t really get into many specifics. However, based on the clear explanations so far, it could be worth waiting for the rest of the series.\nIf you\u2019re interested in more practical details, we\u2019ve also covered another example before.\n", "title": "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "body": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8aad\u307f\u65b9\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "- \u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8aad\u307f\u65b9\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u56de\u8def\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u4f1d\u9001\u306e\u6700\u5927\u5316", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3068\u624b\u6cd5", "- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u9580\u52d5\u753b\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

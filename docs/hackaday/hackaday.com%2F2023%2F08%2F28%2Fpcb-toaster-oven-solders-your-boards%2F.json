Making toast isnt as complex as reflowing PCBs. [Nabil] decided to modify an oven to get better results. In fact, this was the second iteration and involved making a custom PCB to replace the one in the oven. You can see the unit in the video below.\nOf course, unless you have the exact oven (a Breville BOV450XL), you wont want to duplicate the board, but it might give you some good ideas. The new board has a 2.8-inch capacitive LCD, an ESP32, and a few sensors and actuators.\n\nThe other addition was an exhaust fan, which is a good idea, considering what you put inside. Theres also\u00a0 Raspberry Pi and lots of new holes in the case. Apparently, the oven was able to produce boards even with basic software using proportional control.\nWeve seen similar builds, but everyone has a little different take. This isnt even the first one weve seen with a touchscreen.\n"}

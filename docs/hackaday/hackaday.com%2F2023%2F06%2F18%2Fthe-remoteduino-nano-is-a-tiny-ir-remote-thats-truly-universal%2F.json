But setting them up can be quite a hassle: often, you need to browse through long lists of TV models, key in the codes on the remote with just a blinking LED as confirmation, and then pray that the manufacturer included the correct codes for all your equipment. IR isnt a very complicated technology, however, so its perfectly possible to roll your own universal remote, as [sjm4306] shows in his latest project, the Remoteduino Nano. Its a fully programmable IR remote that gives you maximum flexibility when emulating the codes for those obscure A/V systems scattered around your home.\nThe remote runs on an ATmega328p in a tiny QFN package, which drives a standard 5 mm IR LED through a transistor. Eight buttons are available to the user, which can be freely mapped to any desired code. A five-pin header is included to program the ATmega through its serial port. However, this was mainly done to help debug  a user who only needs to program the device once would typically use a pogo-pin-based adapter instead.\nCurrently, codes can only be programmed through the serial port, but theres also an IR receiver present that can be used to copy codes from an existing remote. [sjm4306] hasnt implemented this feature in software yet, but will probably do so in a future update of the projects Arduino sketch. If youre impatient, you can also have a go at it yourself since all code and the boards Gerber files are freely available for download.\nIts tiny size makes the Remoteduino Nano a convenient tool to keep in your drawer if you like to tinker with A/V systems and keep losing those remotes. The Nano is actually an improved version of the original Remoteduino project that [sjm4306] developed a couple of years ago. The problem of a truly universal remote is one that dates back several decades, however.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u5fc5\u898b\uff1aRemoteduino Nano\u300d", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5cIR\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u300cRemoteduino Nano\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01ATmega328p\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u30018\u3064\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306b\u4efb\u610f\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u3001\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3057\u304b\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001IR\u30ec\u30b7\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u5c06\u6765\u7684\u306b\u306f\u305d\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u8ffd\u52a0\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u57fa\u677f\u306eGerber\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306f\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u5fc5\u898b\uff1aRemoteduino Nano\u300d", "\u300c\u9762\u5012\u306a\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304b\u3089\u89e3\u653e\uff01\u5b8c\u5168\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30d6\u30eb\u306aRemoteduino Nano\u300d", "\u300c\u5c0f\u578b\u3067\u6271\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308bRemoteduino Nano\u300d", "\u300cTV\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u898b\u308b\u306e\u306b\u5fc5\u9808\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30eb\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305fRemoteduino Nano\u300d", "\u300cRemoteduino Nano\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\uff01\u300d"]}

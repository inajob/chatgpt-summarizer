But setting them up can be quite a hassle: often, you need to browse through long lists of TV models, key in the codes on the remote with just a blinking LED as confirmation, and then pray that the manufacturer included the correct codes for all your equipment. IR isnt a very complicated technology, however, so its perfectly possible to roll your own universal remote, as [sjm4306] shows in his latest project, the Remoteduino Nano. Its a fully programmable IR remote that gives you maximum flexibility when emulating the codes for those obscure A/V systems scattered around your home.\nThe remote runs on an ATmega328p in a tiny QFN package, which drives a standard 5 mm IR LED through a transistor. Eight buttons are available to the user, which can be freely mapped to any desired code. A five-pin header is included to program the ATmega through its serial port. However, this was mainly done to help debug  a user who only needs to program the device once would typically use a pogo-pin-based adapter instead.\nCurrently, codes can only be programmed through the serial port, but theres also an IR receiver present that can be used to copy codes from an existing remote. [sjm4306] hasnt implemented this feature in software yet, but will probably do so in a future update of the projects Arduino sketch. If youre impatient, you can also have a go at it yourself since all code and the boards Gerber files are freely available for download.\nIts tiny size makes the Remoteduino Nano a convenient tool to keep in your drawer if you like to tinker with A/V systems and keep losing those remotes. The Nano is actually an improved version of the original Remoteduino project that [sjm4306] developed a couple of years ago. The problem of a truly universal remote is one that dates back several decades, however.\n\n"}

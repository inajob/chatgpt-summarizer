While film is among the more well-known analog photographic methods available, there are chemically simpler ways of taking pictures available for those willing to experiment a little bit. Cyanotype photography is one of these methods, and as [JGJMatt] shows, it only takes a few commonly available chemicals, some paper, and a slightly modified box camera to get started.\nCyanotype photography works by adding UV-reactive chemicals to paper and exposing the paper similarly to how film would be exposed. The photographs come out blue wherever the paper wasnt exposed and white where it was. Before mixing up chemicals and taking photos, though, [JGJMatt] needed to restore an old Kodak Brownie camera, designed to use a now expensive type of film. Once the camera is cleaned up, only a few modifications are needed to adapt it to the cyanotype method, one of which involves placing a magnet on the shutter to keep it open for the longer exposure times needed for this type of photography. There is some development to do on these pictures, but its relatively simple to do in comparison to more traditional chemical film development.\nFor anyone looking for a different way of taking photographs, or even those looking for a method of taking analog pictures without the hassle of developing film or creating a darkroom, cyanotype offers a much easier entry point and plenty of artists creating images with this method dont use a camera at all. There are plenty of other photographic chemistries to explore as well; one of our favorites uses platinum to create striking black-and-white photos.", "title": "\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f\u6cd5: \u7c21\u4fbf\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u9752\u3044\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308d\u3046", "body": "\u5199\u771f\u5bb6\u306e\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u306f\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u79fb\u884c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3067\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308b\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u3082\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b7\u30a2\u30ce\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f\u306f\u3001\u7d19\u306b\u7d2b\u5916\u7dda\u53cd\u5fdc\u6027\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u85ac\u54c1\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u9732\u5149\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u3001\u7d19\u3001\u82e5\u5e72\u306e\u6539\u9020\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u73fe\u50cf\u306e\u624b\u9593\u3084\u6697\u5ba4\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u3082\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u73fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f\u6cd5: \u7c21\u4fbf\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u9752\u3044\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308d\u3046", "\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f\u306b\u6311\u6226", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u5199\u771f\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5: \u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f", "\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f\u6cd5\u3067\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u4ee3\u66ff\u6cd5: \u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u5199\u771f"]}

And it would have been tied for the world\u2019s first if inventor [Jamieson \u201cJim\u201d Rowe] hadn\u2019t held back from publishing to rework the design to expand the memory to a full 256 bytes. The price of perfectionism?\nFlash forward 50 years, and [Gwyllym Suter] has taken on the job of recreating the EDUC-8 using modern PCBs, but otherwise staying true to the all-TTL design. He has all of his schematics up on the project\u2019s GitHub, but has also sent us a number of beauty shots that we\u2019re including below. Other than the progress of PCB tech and the very nice 3D-printed housing, they look identical. We have to admit that we love those wavy hand-drawn traces on the original, but we wouldnt be sad about not having to solder in all those jumpers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to dig more into the EDUC-8, or the 8008-based Mark-8 that just nosed it out across the finish line, you can find the original articles online, or even check one out in person at the Computer History Museum. We wonder how many of these were ever made, and how many survive in the wild?"}

We know the feeling and liked his idea of mounting his oscilloscope on an articulated arm. This is easy now because many new scopes have VESA mounts like monitors or TVs. However, watching the video below, we discovered there was a bit more to it than you might imagine.\nFirst, there are many choices of arms. [VoltLog] went for a cheap one with springs that didnt have a lot of motion range. You may want something different. But we didnt realize that many of these arms have a minimum weight requirement, and modern scopes may be too light for some of these arms. Most arms require at least 2 kg of weight to balance the tensions in their springs or hydraulics. Of course, you could add a little weight to the mounting plate of the arm if you needed it. The only downside we see is that it makes it hard to remove the scope if you want to use it somewhere else.\nAssuming you have a mount you like, the rest is easy. Of course, your scope might not have VESA mounting holes. No problem. You can probably find a 3D printed design for an adapter or make (or adapt) your own. You might want to print a cable holder at the same time.\nHonestly, weve thought of mounting a scope to the wall, but this seems nicer. We might still think about 3D printing some kind of adapter that would let you easily remove the scope without tools.\nOf course, there is another obvious place to mount your scope. Monitor arms can also mount microscopes.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u52d5\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "[VoltLog]\u306f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u304f\u3066\u56f0\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u53ef\u52d5\u5f0f\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u306f\u6700\u4f4e\u91cd\u91cf\u8981\u4ef6\u304c\u3042\u308a\u30012kg\u306e\u91cd\u3055\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002VESA\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u7528\u306e\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u53ef\u52d5\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u58c1\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u91cd\u3055\u306e\u5236\u7d04\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051", "VESA\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u306a\u3044\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

So, in a recent video, he focused on the components he decided to update for safety and other reasons. Meanwhile, we get treated to a nice teardown of this iconic piece of test gear.\nIf you didnt grow up in the 1960s, it seems strange that the device has a polarized line cord with one end connected to the chassis. But that used to be quite common, just like kids didnt wear helmets on bikes in those days.\nA lot of TVs were hot chassis back then, too. We were always taught to touch the chassis with the back of your hand first. That way, if you get a shock, the associated muscle contraction will pull your hand away from the electricity. Touching it normally will make you grip the offending chassis hard, and you probably wont be able to let go until someone kindly pulls the plug or a fuse blows.\nThese signal generators were very common back in the day. A lot of Heathkit gear was very serviceable and more affordable than the commercial alternatives. In 1970, these cost about $32 as a kit or $60 already built. While $32 doesnt sound like much, it is equivalent to $260 today, so not an impulse buy.\nSome of the parts are simply irreplaceable. The variable capacitor would be tough to source since it is a special type. The coils would also be tough to find replacements, although you might have luck rewinding them if it were necessary.\nWe are spoiled today with so many cheap quality instruments available. However, there was something satisfying about building your own gear and it certainly helped if you ever had to fix it.\nThere was so much Heathkit gear around that even though theyve been gone for years, you still see quite a few units in use. Not all of their gear had tubes, but some of our favorite ones did."}

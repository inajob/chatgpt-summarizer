The amateur radio community have seized upon it with glee and already reverse-engineered much of the firmware, but flashing the thing has always required a minor effort. Now thanks to the work of [whosmatt], it can be flashed with little more than a web browser and a serial cable.\nThis feat was made possible through the magic of WebSerial, a handy feature that allows web applications to talk to connected hardware. Weve seen it in action a few times in the world of badges, and as browser support for it has improved its now available through browsers on all the major platforms.\nThe web app allows tweaking of the Quansheng settings and will, no doubt, be capable of uploading that when fully open-source firmware is available. It should be of great interest well beyond the world of Chinese radios, though, because were guessing there are a lot of projects that could benefit from such a ubiquitous interface tool.\nIf youd like to know more, WebSerial is something weve looked at in the past.\nHeader image: [Concretedog]"}

Or peanuts into beer? It seems like an altogether strange thing to do, but if youve tried it, youll have seen the way the raisins dance and tumble in the fluid. As it turns out, theres some really interesting science at play when you dive into the mechanics of it all. [Saverio Spagnolie] did just that, and even went as far as publishing a paper on the topic.\nThe fundamental mechanism behind the dancing raisins is down to the bubbles in sparkling water. When dropped into the fluid, bubbles form on the raisins and attach to them, giving them additional buoyancy.\u00a0 They then float up, with some of the bubbles shedding or popping on the way, others doing so at the fluid surface. This then causes the raisins to lose buoyancy, rotate, flop around, and generally dance for our amusement.\n[Saverio] didnt just accept things at face value though, and started taking measurements. He used 3D-printed models to examine bubble formation and the forces involved. Along with other scientists, models were developed to explore bubble formation, shedding, and the dynamics of raisin movement. If you dont have time to dive into the paper, [Saverio] does a great job of explaining it in a Twitter thread in an accessible fashion.\nIts a great example of cheap kitchen science that can teach you all kinds of incredible physics if you just care to look. Video after the break.\n\n\nIt turns out that sparkling water and raisins are *fascinating*. My daughter and I happened upon this effect playing together in the kitchen a long time ago, and I couldn't help but explore the system more deeply 1/n https://t.co/wNBX7nnGJS pic.twitter.com/BVmVOeHvrP\n Saverio Spagnolie (@SaverioIV) September 13, 2023\n"}

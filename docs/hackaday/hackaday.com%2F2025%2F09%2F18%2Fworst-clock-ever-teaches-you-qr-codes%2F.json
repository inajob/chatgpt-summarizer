Indeed, it is nothing more than a super-cheap ESP32-C3 breakout board with an OLED screen and some code. Worse, you cant even tell the time on it without pointing your cell phone at the QR code it generates. Plot twist: you skip the QR code and check the time on your phone.\nBut then we got to thinking, and there is actually a lot to learn from here on the software side. This thing pulls the time down from an NTP server, formats it into a nice human-readable string using strftime, throws that string into a QR code thats generated on the fly, and then pushes the bits out to the screen. All in a handful of lines of code.\nAs always, the secret is in the libraries and how you use them, and we wanted to check out the QR code generator, but we couldnt find an exact match for QRCodeGenerator.h. Probably the most popular library is the Arduino QRCode library by [ricmoo]. Its bundled with Arduino, but labelled version 0.0.1, which we find a little bit modest given how widely its used. It also hasnt been updated in eight years: proof that it just works?\nThat library drew from [nayuki]s fantastically documented multi-language QR-Code-generator library, which should have you covered on any platform you can imagine, with additional third-party ports to languages you havent even heard of. Thats where wed go for a non-Arduino project.\nWhat library did [WTH] use? We hope to find out soon, but at least we found a couple good candidates, and it appears to be a version of one or the other.\nWeve seen a lot of projects where the hacker generates a QR code using some online tool, packs the bits into a C header array, and displays that. Thats fine when you only need a single static QR code, but absolutely limiting when you want to make something dynamic. You know, like an unreadable clock.\nYou will not be surprised to know that this isnt the first unreadable QR-code clock weve featured here. But its definitely the smallest and most instructive.\n\n"}

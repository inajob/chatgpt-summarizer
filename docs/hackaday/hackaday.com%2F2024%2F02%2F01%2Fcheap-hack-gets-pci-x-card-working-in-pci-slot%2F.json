And yet, that neednt be the case. As [Peter] shows us, you can work around this with a cheap hacky hack. Our favorite kind!\n[Peter] had a PCI-X RAID card that he wanted to use on his Socket 7-based computer. The 3ware 9550SX PCI-X card is 3.3 V only, and doesnt fit in a typical PCI slot. Its not compatible mechanically or electrically. Enter a PCI-X riser, which gets around the missing notch that would normally not let the card sit in the slot. Other than that, it just took masking off some pins to avoid damage from the 5 V rail. Throughput is good, too, reportedly sitting at roughly 60-70 MB/s.\nThe hard part is probably finding a PCI-X riser; PCI-Express stuff is far more common. Few of us need to deal with PCI-X anymore, but if youre working on some ancient industrial hardware or something, this hack might just save your beans from the roast pot one day.\n\n"}

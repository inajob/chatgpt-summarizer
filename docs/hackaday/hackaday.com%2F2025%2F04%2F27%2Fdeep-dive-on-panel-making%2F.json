However, for a polished look, you also need a labeled front panel. Weve looked at several methods for doing that in the past, but we enjoyed [Accidental Sciences] video showing his method for making laminated panels.\nHis first step is to draw the panel in Inkscape, and he has some interesting tips for getting the most out of the program. He makes a few prints and laminates one of them. The other is a drill guide. You use the drill guide to make openings in the panel, which could be aluminum, steel, plastic, or whatever material you want to work in.\n\nThe laminated print goes on last with just enough glue to hold it. Is it a lot of work? You bet it is. But the results look great. There are a number of things to look out for, so if you plan to do this, the video will probably save you from making some mistakes.\nThere are many ways to get this job done. Weve asked you for ideas before and, as usual, you came through. If you want a different take on laminated panels, there are a few different tips you can glean from this project.\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u3002Inkscape\u3067\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3057\u3001\u30c9\u30ea\u30eb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u958b\u53e3\u90e8\u3092\u958b\u3051\u308b\u3002\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u304c\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u3082\u591a\u6570\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210: \u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u306e\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "- \u30c9\u30ea\u30eb\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u524d\u9762\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u308b", "- \u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u3068\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u624b\u9593\u306f\u304b\u304b\u308b\u304c\u898b\u6804\u3048\u629c\u7fa4\uff01\u30e9\u30df\u30cd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u5236\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

There are things you can do to smooth them  sanding, chemical smoothing, and fillers come to mind. Although this technique technically uses all three, it starts with something very simple.\nIn the video after the break, [DaveRig] gets right to the point: baby powder and resin mixed together make a fine smoothing agent when cured. Having read about it online, he decided to give it a try.\nStarting with a half sphere that had admittedly pretty big layer lines, [DaveRig] mixed up enough resin and baby powder to make the consistency of milk or cream. Then he put five coats on, curing and sanding with 120 in between each one.\nThen its on to standard post-processing stuff. You know, wipe it down with alcohol, sand it a little more, wet sand, and then its on to the airbrush and clear-coat. The end result looks to be as smooth as your average bowling ball, as you can see in the main photo.\nWhats your favorite post-processing method? Have you tried annealing them in salt?\n\n\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for the tip!"}

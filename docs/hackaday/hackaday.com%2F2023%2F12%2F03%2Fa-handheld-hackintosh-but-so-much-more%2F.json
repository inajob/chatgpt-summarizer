There was a time when it seemed that a real computer might be a common miniaturized accessory, but while its not really come to pass, at least [iketsj] has taken a stab at it. His handheld Hackintosh runs MacOS on a miniature scale, and looks rather nice.\nAt its heart is the LattePanda Alpha x86 single board computer, with a small custom expansion board\u00a0 for a couple of buttons, a USB hub, a small keyboard, and a display. These parts are all mounted to a baseboard with metal stand-offs, and the power is sourced from a single USB-C socket at the bottom edge. What makes it more extraordinary is that its not the first handheld Hackintosh from this maker, the previous one being significantly bigger.\nOn one hand then, this is home-built PC like any other, assembled from off-the-shelf-parts. But on the other its far from normal, for despite its simplicity it forms a very usable small form factor device. The Akruvia Una keyboard uses tactile switches so maybe its not the machine to type your thesis on, but other than that it makes a great little machine for MacOS, Linux, or Windows. We like it, and we think you will too when you see the video below the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9Hackintosh\u300d\uff1a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eMacOS\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01", "body": "\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u304c\u5236\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002LattePanda Alpha x86\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3001USB\u30cf\u30d6\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001MacOS\u3001Linux\u3001Windows\u304c\u5b9f\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3001\u826f\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300d", "titles": ["\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9Hackintosh\u300d\uff1a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306eMacOS\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff01", "\u300cLattePanda Alpha\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9PC\u300d\uff1a\u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u5c0f\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u300c\u9a5a\u7570\u306e\u5c0f\u578b\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u300d\uff1a\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9Hackintosh\u304c\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5f62\u3067\u9032\u5316\uff01", "\u300c\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u3066\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300d\uff1aAkruvia Una\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9PC\u304c\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\uff01", "\u300c\u81ea\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9Hackintosh\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d\uff1a\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3054\u89a7\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01"]}

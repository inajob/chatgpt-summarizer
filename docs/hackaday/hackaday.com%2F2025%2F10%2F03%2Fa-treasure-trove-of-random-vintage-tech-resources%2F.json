Working with old-school gear can be tough, though, when documentation or supporting resources are hard to find. If youre in need of an old manual or a little scrap of software, you might find the Vintage Technology Digital Archive (VTDA) a useful destination.\nThe VTDA is a simple website. There is no search function, or fancy graphical way to browse the resources on offer. Instead, its merely a collection of files in a well-ordered directory tree. Click through /pics/DiskSleeves/VTDA/ and youll find a collection of high-resolution scans of various old diskettes and their packaging. /docs/computing/Centronics/ will give you all kinds of useful documentation, from press releases to datasheets for printers long forgotten. You can even find Heathkit schematics and old Windows bootdisk images if you dive into the depths.\nWhile it doesnt have everything, by any means, the VTDA has lots of interesting little bits and pieces that you might not find anywhere else. Its a great counterpart to other archival efforts out on the web, particularly if youre a member of the retrocomputing massive.\nThanks to [Itay] for the tip!", "title": "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6(VTDA)\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "body": "\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6(VTDA)\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u305f\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u6280\u8853\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6(VTDA)\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u8cc7\u6599\u96c6", "- \u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6587\u732e\u3084\u8cc7\u6599\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- VTDA\u3067\u51fa\u4f1a\u3048\u308b\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3084\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u63a2\u3057"]}

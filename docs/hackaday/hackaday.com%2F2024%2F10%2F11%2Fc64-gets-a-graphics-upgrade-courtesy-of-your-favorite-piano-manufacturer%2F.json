[Vossi] has whipped up a bit of an upgrade for the C64 and C128, in the form of a graphics expansion card running Yamaha hardware.\nAs you might expect, the expansion is designed to fit neatly into a C64 cartridge slot. The card runs the Yamaha V9958\u2014the video display processor known for its appearance in the MSX2+ computers. In this case, its paired with a healthy 128 kB of video RAM so it can really do its thing. The V9958 has an analog RGB output that can be set for PAL or NTSC operation, and can perform at resolutions up to 512212 or even 512424 interlaced. Naturally, it needs to be hooked directly up to a compatible screen, like a 1084, or one with SCART input. [Vossi] took the time to create some demos of the chips capabilities, drawing various graphics in a way that the C64 couldnt readily achieve on its own.\nIts a build that almost feels like its from an alternate universe, where Yamaha decided to whip up a third-party graphics upgrade for the C64. That didnt happen, but stranger team ups have occurred over the years.\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]"}

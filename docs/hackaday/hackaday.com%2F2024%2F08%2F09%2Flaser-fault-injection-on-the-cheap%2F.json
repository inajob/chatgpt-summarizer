Therein must be machines of such sophistication that no electronic device could resist their attempts to defeat whatever security is baked into their silicon. Machines such as these no doubt bear price tags that only a no-questions-asked budget could support, making their techniques firmly out of reach of even the most ambitious home gamer.\nThat might be changing, though, with this $500 DIY laser fault injection setup. It comes to us from Finnish cybersecurity group [Fraktal], who have started a series of blog posts detailing how they built their open-source reverse-engineering rig. LFI is similar to other glitching attacks weve covered before, such as EMP fault injection, except that a laser shining directly on a silicon die is used to disrupt its operation rather than a burst of electromagnetic energy.\nSince LFI requires shining the laser very precisely on nanometer-scale elements of a bare silicon die, nanopositioning is the biggest challenge. Rather than moving the device under attack, the [Fraktal] rig uses a modified laser galvanometer to scan an IR laser over the device. The galvo and the optical components are all easily available online, and theyve started a repo to document the modifications needed and the code to tire everything together.\nOf course, this technique requires the die in the device under study to be exposed, but [Fraktal] has made that pretty approachable too. They include instructions for milling away the epoxy from the lead-frame side of a chip, which is safer for the delicate structures etched into the top of the die. The laser can then shine directly through the die from the bottom. For flip-chip packages like BGAs, the same milling technique would be done from the top of the package. Either way, we can imagine a small CNC mill making the process safer and quicker, even though they seem to have done pretty well with a Dremel.\nThis looks like a fantastic reverse engineering tool, and were really looking forward to the rest of the story.\n\n\nThanks to [gnud] for the heads up on this one.", "title": "DIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5de5\u5834\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "CIA\u3084NSA\u306a\u3069\u306e\u6a5f\u95a2\u306e\u6697\u53f7\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\u306b\u306f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u304c500\u30c9\u30eb\u306eDIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u653b\u6483\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u9014\u3067\u6ce8\u76ee\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5de5\u5834\u306e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a$500\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308bDIY\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u6210\u529f\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6545\u969c\u653b\u6483\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5", "\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1aDIY\u30ca\u30ce\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u88c5\u7f6e"]}

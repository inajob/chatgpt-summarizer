But if you get to a certain level of complexity, schematics are a pain. Modern designers  especially for digital circuits  prefer to use some kind of hardware description language.\nThere are a few options to do similar things with PCB layout, including tscircuit. Theres a walk-through for using it to create an LED matrix and you can even try it out online, if you like. If youre more of a visual learner, theres also an introductory video you can watch below.\n\nThe example project imports a Pico microcontroller and some smart LEDs. They do appear graphically, but you dont have to deal with them graphically. You write code to manage the connections. For example:\ntrace from={\".LED1 .GND\"} to=\"net.GND\" /\n\nIf that looks like HTML to you, you arent wrong. Once you have the schematic, you can do the same kind of thing to lay out the PCB using footprints. If you want to play with the actual design, you can load it in your browser and make changes. Youll note that at the top right, there are buttons that let you view the schematic, the board, a 3D render of the board, a BOM, an assembly drawing, and several other types of output.\nWill we use this? We dont know. Years ago, designers resisted using HDLs for FPGAs, but the bigger FPGAs get, the fewer people want to deal with page after page of schematics. Maybe a better question is: Will you use this? Let us know in the comments.\nThis isnt a new idea, of course. Time will tell which HDLs will survive and which will whither.\n"}

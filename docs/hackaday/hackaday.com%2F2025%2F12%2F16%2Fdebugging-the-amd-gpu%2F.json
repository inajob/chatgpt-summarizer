Kennedy gets the credit for popularizing it, George Bernard Shaw said: Some men see things as they are and say, Why? I dream of things that never were and say, Why not?' Well, [Hadz] didnt wonder why there werent many GPU debuggers. Instead, [Hadz] decided to create one.\nIt wasnt the first; he found some blog posts by [Marcell Kiss] that helped, and that led to a series of experiments youll enjoy reading about. Plus, dont miss the video below that shows off a live demo.\nIt seems that if you dont have an AMD GPU, this may not be directly useful. But it is still a fascinating peek under the covers of a modern graphics card. Ever wonder how to interact with a video card without using something like Vulkan? This post will tell you how.\nWriting a debugger is usually a tricky business anyway. Working with the strange GPU architecture makes it even stranger. Traps let you gain control, but implementing features like breakpoints and single-stepping isnt simple.\nWeve used things like CUDA and OpenCL, but we havent been this far down in the weeds. At least, not yet. CUDA, of course, is specific to NVIDIA cards, isnt it?\n\n", "title": "- \u8ab0\u3082\u4f5c\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305fGPU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fHadz\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "Hadz\u304cGPU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u63a2\u6c42\u3002", "titles": ["- \u8ab0\u3082\u4f5c\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305fGPU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305fHadz\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- GPU\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff1aHadz\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u958b\u767a", "- AMD GPU\u4ee5\u5916\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\uff01\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u3092\u8997\u3053\u3046", "- Vulkan\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\uff1f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "- CUDA\u3068OpenCL\u306e\u5148\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u306eGPU\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

Check out the Pinkpad, a DIY laptop project that as if appeared out of nowhere, gives you a based on an off-the-shelf Dell motherboard. This build projects an aura of unabashed competence  the website brings you to a different universe, the documentation is as curt as it is extensive, and the build evidently works.\nWith a Thinkpad x61 keyboard, a reasonably modern (Dell Vostro 5481, Ryzen possible) motherboard embeddable inside, and a 10 1024768 screen, this ~11 laptop packs a certain kind of punch for whats a build-it-yourself project. Most of the value of this design is in the 3D files  which were done in Google SketchUp, and the laptop is small enough that you could print its shell reasonably quickly. Not that you should follow the parts list religiously  the screen in particular might just warrant reconsideration in your eyes. On the other hand, we wish you all the luck on your SketchUp journey if you want to modify the shell. It also isnt lost on us that the parts list doesnt list a battery in it.\nThis is an impressive project to see open-sourced, and we hope it can inspire some hackers in the custom laptop building cohort. One prominent flaw of consumer-facing technology is that you cant always get your devices in pink, and printing your laptops chassis yourself is a surefire way to combat this. If this laptops form-factor is too commonplace for you, weve seen no shortage of custom laptops grace our pages, from miniature ones to CRT luggable beasts, and click on the tags below if youd like to see more!\nWe thank [Max_UA] for sharing this with us!"}

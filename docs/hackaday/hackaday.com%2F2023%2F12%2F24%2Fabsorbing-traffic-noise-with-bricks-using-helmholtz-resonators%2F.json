Finding a way to attenuate especially the low-frequency noise of road traffic was the subject of [Joe Krcma]s Masters Thesis, the results of which he gave a talk on at the Portland Maker Meetup Club after graduating from University College London. The chosen solution in his thesis are Helmholtz resonators, which are a kind of acoustic spring. Using a carefully selected opening into the cavity, frequencies can be filtered out, and extinguished inside the cavity.\nBasic functionality and formula used to determine the dimensions of a Helmholtz Resonator.\nAs examples of existing uses of Helmholtz resonators in London, he points at the Queen Elizabeth Hall music venue, as well as the newly opened Queen Elizabeth Line and Paddington Station. For indoor applications there are a number of commercial offerings, but could this be applied to outdoor ceramics as well, to render urban environments into something approaching an oasis of peace and quiet?\nFor the research, [Joe]s group developed a number of Helmholtz resonator designs and manufacturing methods, with [Joe] focusing on clay fired versions. For manufacturing, 3D printing of the clay was attempted, which didnt work out too well. This was followed by slip casting, which allowed for the casting of regular rectangular bricks.\nBut after issues with making casting hollow bricks work, as well as the cracking of the bricks during firing in the kiln, the work of another student in the group inspired [Joe] to try a different approach. The result was a very uniquely shaped brick that, when assembled into a wall, forms three Helmholtz resonators: inside it, as well as two within the space with other bricks. During trials, the bricks showed similar sound-deadening performance as\u00a0 foam and wood. He also made the shape available on Thingiverse, if you want to try printing or casting it yourself.\n\n", "title": "\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668\u306e\u958b\u767a", "body": "\u90fd\u5e02\u3084\u90fd\u5e02\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u5fc5\u7136\u7684\u306a\u5074\u9762\u306e1\u3064\u306f\u3001\u9a12\u97f3\u3067\u3059\u3002\u7279\u306b\u9053\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u306e\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u9a12\u97f3\u3092\u8efd\u6e1b\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3001[Joe Krcma]\u306e\u4fee\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u9cf4\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u9078\u629e\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u306eQueen Elizabeth Hall\u306e\u97f3\u697d\u4f1a\u5834\u3084\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u3057\u305fQueen Elizabeth Line\u3084Paddington Station\u304c\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u4f8b\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u4f4e\u5468\u6ce2\u30ce\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u97f3\u3092\u6d88\u3059\u7a74\uff1f\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u6a5f\u80fd\u3068\u516c\u5f0f", "\u97f3\u697d\u4f1a\u5834\u3084\u99c5\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01\u5c4b\u5916\u30bb\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668", "\u77e9\u5f62\u306e\u58c1\u304c3\u3064\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30e0\u30db\u30eb\u30c4\u5171\u632f\u5668\u306b\uff01\u65ac\u65b0\u306a\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u7149\u74e6\u306e\u88fd\u9020"]}

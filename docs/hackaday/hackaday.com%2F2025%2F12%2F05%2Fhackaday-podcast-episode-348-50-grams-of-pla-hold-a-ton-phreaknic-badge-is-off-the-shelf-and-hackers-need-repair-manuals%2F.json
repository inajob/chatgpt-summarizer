Things start off with a warning about the long-term viability of SSD backups, after which the discussion moves onto the limits of 3D printed PLA, the return of the Pebble smart watch, some unconventional aircraft, and an online KiCad schematic repository that has plenty of potential. Youll also hear about a remarkable conference badge made from e-waste electronic shelf labels, filling 3D prints with foam, and a tiny TV powered by the ESP32. The episode wraps up with our wish for hacker-friendly repair manuals, and an interesting tale of underwater engineering from D-Day.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nAs always, this episode is available in DRM-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 348 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nA Friendly Reminder That Your Unpowered SSDs Are Probably Losing Data\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongratulations to [for_want_of_a_better_handle] for guessing the data center ambiance!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nDesigning PLA To Hold Over A Metric Ton\nThe New Pebble: Now 100% Open Source\nMagnus Effect Drone Flies, Looks Impossible\n\nYour Quadcopter Has Three Propellers Too Many\nKFC Winged Aircraft Actually Flies\n\n\nAn Online Repository For KiCad Schematics\nShelf Life Extended: Hacking E-Waste Tags Into Conference Badges\nOn The Benefits Of Filling 3D Prints With Spray Foam\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nGet To The Games On Time With This Ancient-Style Waterclock\nHow To Design 3D Printed Pins That Won\u2019t Break\nNecroprinting Isn\u2019t As Bad As It Sounds\nTiny Little TV Runs On ESP32\n\n\nToms Picks:\n\nLittle Lie Detector Is Probably No Worse Than The Big Ones\nBuild Your Own Glasshole Detector\nPortable Plasma Cutter Removes Rust, Packs A (Reasonable) Punch\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nGive Us One Manual For Normies, Another For Hackers\nHow Cross-Channel Plumbing Fuelled The Allied March On Berlin\n", "title": "- SSD\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9577\u671f\u4fdd\u5b58\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8b66\u544a", "body": "SSD\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u559a\u8d77\u30843D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3001Pebble\u6642\u8a08\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306a\u3069\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["- SSD\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u9577\u671f\u4fdd\u5b58\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8b66\u544a", "- PLA\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u63a2\u308b\uff013D\u5370\u5237\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u578bPebble\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u304b\u3089\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8", "- ESP32\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

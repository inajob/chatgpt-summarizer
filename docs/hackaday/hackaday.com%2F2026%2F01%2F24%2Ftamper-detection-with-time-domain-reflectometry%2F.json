Such devices, therefore, often integrate circuit meshes into their cases and regularly monitor them for changes that could indicate damage. To improve the sensitivity and accuracy of such countermeasures, [Jan Sebastian G\u00f6tte] and [Bj\u00f6rn Scheuermann] recently designed a time-domain reflectometer to monitor meshes (pre-print paper).\nMany meshes are made from flexible circuit boards with winding traces built into the case, so cutting or drilling into the case breaks a trace. The problem is that most common ways to detect broken traces, such as by resistance or capacitance measurements, aren\u2019t easy to implement with both high sensitivity and low error rates. Instead, this system uses time-domain reflectometry: it sends a sharp pulse into the mesh, then times the returning echoes to create a mesh fingerprint. When the circuit is damaged, it creates an additional echo, which is detected by classifier software. If enough subsequent measurements find a significant fingerprint change, it triggers a data wipe.\nThe most novel aspect of this design is its affordability. An STM32G4-series microcontroller manages the timing, pulse generation, and measurement, thanks to its two fast ADCs and a high-resolution timer with sub-200 picosecond resolution. For a pulse-shaping amplifier, [Jan] and [Bj\u00f6rn] used the high-speed amplifiers in an HDMI redriver chip, which would normally compensate for cable and connector losses. Despite its inexpensive design, the circuit was sensitive enough to detect when oscilloscope probes contacted the trace, pick up temperature changes, and even discern the tiny variations between different copies of the same mesh.\nIt\u2019s not absolutely impossible for an attacker to bypass this system, nor was it intended to be, but overcoming it would take a great deal of skill and some custom equipment, such as a non-conductive drill bit. If you\u2019re interested in seeing such a system in the real world, check out this teardown of a payment terminal. One of the same authors also previously wrote a KiCad plugin to generate anti-tamper meshes.\nThanks to [mark999] for the tip!", "title": "\u9ad8\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u8b77\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u76e3\u8996\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u9ad8\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306f\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u6d88\u53bb\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53cd\u5c04\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u304c\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u7834\u640d\u76e3\u8996\u3092\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u3067\u884c\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u9ad8\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4fdd\u8b77\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u76e3\u8996\u6280\u8853", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u306a\u7834\u640d\u691c\u77e5\uff1a\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u53cd\u5c04\u8a08\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u6280\u8853", "STM32G4\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u654f\u611f\u306a\u56de\u8def\u76e3\u8996\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u653b\u6483\u8005\u5bfe\u7b56\uff1a\u524a\u308a\u3084\u30c9\u30ea\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u56de\u8def\u7834\u640d\u691c\u77e5\u306e\u65b0\u624b\u6cd5"]}

Its got a bit of an odd design, but a compelling one, and the keyboard is pretty nifty, too. [r0r0] found one of these old-school machines and decided it was well worth refitting it to give it some modern grunt.\nThe Portable III ended up scoring a mini-ITX build, with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X and an AMD RX580 GPU. Cramming all this into the original shell took some work, like using a vertical riser to fit in the GPU. Hilariously, the RGB RAM sticks are a little bit wasted when the enclosure is closed.\nFor the purists out there, youll be relieved to know the machines original plasma display was dead. Thus, a larger modern LCD was fitted instead. However, [r0r0] did play around with software to emulate the plasma look just for fun.\nIts funny to think you could once score one of these proud machines for free at a swap meet.\n\nhttps://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1956008368550400/1.mp4\nhttps://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1956008368550400/2.mp4", "title": "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u529b\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u300d", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebIII\u306f386\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u3067\u3001\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u304c\u4eca\u65e5\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u9803\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u98a8\u306b\u30ea\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3001AMD Ryzen 7 3700X\u3084AMD RX580 GPU\u306a\u3069\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30df\u30cbITX\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u529b\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u300d", "\u300cCompaq Portable III\u3092\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "\u300cAMD Ryzen\u3068RX580 GPU\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305fPortable III\u300d", "\u300c\u53e4\u3044\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u306b\u30df\u30cb-ITX\u30d3\u30eb\u30c9\u3092\u53ce\u7d0d\u300d", "\u300c\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u6db2\u6676\u306b\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u300d"]}

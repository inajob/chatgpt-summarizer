Its got a bit of an odd design, but a compelling one, and the keyboard is pretty nifty, too. [r0r0] found one of these old-school machines and decided it was well worth refitting it to give it some modern grunt.\nThe Portable III ended up scoring a mini-ITX build, with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X and an AMD RX580 GPU. Cramming all this into the original shell took some work, like using a vertical riser to fit in the GPU. Hilariously, the RGB RAM sticks are a little bit wasted when the enclosure is closed.\nFor the purists out there, youll be relieved to know the machines original plasma display was dead. Thus, a larger modern LCD was fitted instead. However, [r0r0] did play around with software to emulate the plasma look just for fun.\nIts funny to think you could once score one of these proud machines for free at a swap meet.\n\nhttps://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1956008368550400/1.mp4\nhttps://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1956008368550400/2.mp4"}

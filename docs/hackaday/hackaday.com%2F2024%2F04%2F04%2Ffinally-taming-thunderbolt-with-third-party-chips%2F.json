At least, until last year, when we saw announcements about ASMedia developing two chips for Thunderbolt use. Now, we are starting to see open source, letting us tinker with PCIe at prices lower than $100 per endpoint.\nIn particular, this board from Reddit uses the ASM2464PD  a chipset that supports TB3/4/USB4, and gives you a 4x PCIe link. Harnessing the 40 Gbps power to wire up an NVMe SSD, this board shows us its very much possible to design a fully functional ASM2464PD board while going only off whatever scarce data is available to the public. With minimal footprint that barely extends beyond the 2230 SSD its designed for, curved trace layout, and a CNC-milled case, this board sets a high standard for a DIY Thunderbolt implementation.\nThe main problem is that this project is not open-source  all we get is pretty pictures and a bit of technical info. Thankfully, weve also seen [WifiCable] take up the mantle of making this chip actually hobbyist-available  shes created a symbol, fit a footprint, and made an example board in KiCad retracing [Picomicro]s steps in a friendly fashion. The board is currently incomplete because it needs someone to buy an ASM2464PD enclosure on Aliexpress and reverse-engineer the missing circuitry, but if open-source Thunderbolt devices are on your wish list, this is as close as you get today  maybe youll be able to make an eGPU adapter, even. In the meantime, if you dont want to develop hardware but want to take advantage of Thunderbolt, you can build 10 Gbps point-to-point networks.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067DIY\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3059\u308b", "body": "\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u306f\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u304c\u79d8\u5bc6\u88cf\u306b\u4fdd\u6301\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001ASMedia\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305fASM2464PD\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u304c\u9032\u307f\u3001DIY\u3067\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u88fd\u54c1\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u73fe\u5728\u306f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u306a\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3067DIY\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3059\u308b", "ASMedia\u304c\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\u5bfe\u5fdc\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3092\u767a\u8868", "Reddit\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304cASM2464PD\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c", "Thunderbolt\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fNVMe SSD\u3092\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306aDIY\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5411\u3051\u306bASMedia\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5b9f\u4f8b\u306e\u5236\u4f5c"]}

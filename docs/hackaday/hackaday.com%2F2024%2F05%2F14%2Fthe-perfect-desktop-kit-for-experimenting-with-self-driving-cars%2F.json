But you can still dive into this world on a smaller scale, as [jmoreno555] demonstrates.\nThe build consists of a small RC car\u2014an HSP 94123, in fact. Its got a simple brushed motor inside, driven by a conventional speed controller, and servo-driven steering. A Raspberry Pi 4 is charged with driving the car, but its not alone. Its outfitted with a Google Coral USB stick, which is a machine learning accelerator card capable of 4 trillion operations per second. The car also has a Wemos D1 onboard, charged with interfacing distance sensors to give the car a sense of its environment. Vision is courtesy of a 1.2-megapixel camera with a 160-degree lens, and a stereoscopic camera with twin 75-degree lenses.\u00a0Software-wise, its early days yet. [jmoreno555] is exploring the use of Python and OpenCV to implement basic lane detection and other self driving routines, while using Blender as a simulator.\nThe real magic idea, though, is the treadmill. [jmoreno555] realized that one of the frustrations of working in this space is in having to chase a car around a test track. Instead, the use of a desktop treadmill allows the car to be programmed and debugged with less fuss in the early stages of development.\nIf youre looking for a platform to experiment with AI and self-driving, this could be an project to dive in to. Weve covered some other great builds in this space, too. Meanwhile, if youve cracked driving autonomy and want to let us know, our tipsline is always standing by!"}

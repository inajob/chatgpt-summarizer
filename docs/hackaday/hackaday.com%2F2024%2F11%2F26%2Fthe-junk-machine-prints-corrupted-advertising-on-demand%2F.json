This machine simplifies and magnifies that in a physical way.\nWe cant help but think that The Junk Machine is in a way highlighting Sturgeons Law (paraphrased as ninety percent of everything is crud) which happens to be particularly applicable to the current AI landscape. In short, the ease of use of these tools means that crud is also being effortlessly generated at an unprecedented scale, swamping any positive elements.\nAs for the hardware and software, were very interested in whats inside. Unfortunately theres no deep technical details, but the broad strokes are that The Junk Machine uses an embedded NVIDIA Jetson loaded up with Stable Diffusions SDXL Turbo, an open source AI image generator that can be installed and run locally. When and if a user mashes a large red button, the machine generates a piece of AI junk mail in real time without any need for a network connection of any kind, and prints it from an embedded printer.\nWatch it in action in the video embedded below, just under the page break. There are a few more different photos on [ClownVamp]s X account.\n\nhttps://cdn.transientlabs.xyz/tlx/junk-machine/TJM_Video.mp4", "title": "\u300cAI\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u300d", "body": "\u300cJunk Machine\u300d\u306f\u3001\u7121\u610f\u5473\u306aAI\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u751f\u6210\u30fb\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u6a5f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cAI\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\uff01\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u300d", "\u300c\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88cf\u5074\uff1a\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u304c\u793a\u3059\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u554f\u984c\u300d", "\u300c\u7121\u610f\u5473\u306a\u5e83\u544a\u3092\u5370\u5237\u3059\u308b\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "\u300cAI\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6ce2\u306b\u98f2\u307e\u308c\u308b\uff1a\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300d", "\u300cNVIDIA Jetson\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a\u300e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u300f\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d"]}

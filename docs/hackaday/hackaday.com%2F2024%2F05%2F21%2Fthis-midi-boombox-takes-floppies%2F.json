As [Nicole] explains, the odd little device played MIDI files from a floppy disk. Technically, it wasnt truly a boombox because it lacked batteries, but it sure looks like one.\nThe box also had a MIDI input jack, but no output. For an antique gadget, it is pretty impressive, but maybe not much by todays standards. Of course, what we really wanted to see was what was inside. [Nicole] doesnt disappoint.\nThe boombox brains are a pair of Hitachi H8 3000-series CPUs. The boards actually looks surprisingly modern until you notice the lack of integration. There are separate ROMs, RAMs, a floppy drive controller, and, of course, MIDI chips. Apparently, opening the box up is a challenge so [Nicole] suggests not doing it unless necessary. We assume it went back together with no problems.\nThere are lots of tidbits about peculiarities in the device. There are also, of course, recordings of the output and some comparisons from other devices. A great look into an old and odd piece of gear.\nSince it has an input jack, you could connect it to  oh, we dont know  maybe some spoons? Or a hurdy-gurdy."}

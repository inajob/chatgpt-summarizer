If youve ever wanted to go mad with power in the comfort of your own home, try this electronic orchestra baton by [Larry Lu] and [Kathryn Zhang].\nThe wireless baton peripheral part of the system uses a Pico W and an IMU to detect the speed of conducting a 4/4 measure. That information is then transmitted to the central Pico W access point which plays a .wav at the speed corresponding to the conductors specified beats per minute (BPM). Setting the baton down will pause the visualizer and audio playback.\nThe central Pico W uses direct memory access (DMA) and SPI communication to control the audio output and VGA visualization. Since most .wav files have a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, this gave the students a reference to increase or decrease the DMA audio channel timer to control the playback.\nWant some more musical hacks?

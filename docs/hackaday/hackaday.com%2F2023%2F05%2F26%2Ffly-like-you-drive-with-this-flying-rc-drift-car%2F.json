Well, as long as you ignore the problem of scale presented by [Nick Rehm]s flying RC drift car, we pretty much do.\nAt first glance, [Nick]s latest build looks pretty much like your typical quadcopter. But the design has subtle differences that make it more like a car without wheels. The main difference is the pusher prop at the aft, which provides forward thrust without having to pitch the entire craft. Other subtle clues include the belly-mounted lidar and nose-mounted FPV camera, although those arent exactly unknown on standard UAVs.\nThe big giveaway, though, is the RC car-style remote used to fly the drone. Rather than use the standard two-joystick remote, [Nick] rejiggered his dRehmFlight open-source flight control software to make operating the drone less like flying and more like driving. The lidar is used to relieve the operator of the burden of altitude keeping by holding the drone at about a meter or so off the deck. And the video below shows it doing a really good job of it, for the most part  with anything as complicated as the multiple control loops needed to keep this thing in the air, its easy for a sudden input to confuse things.\nWe have to admit that [Nick]s creation looks like a lot of fun to fly, or drive  whichever way you want to look at it. Either way, we like the simplification of the flight control system and translating the driving metaphor into flying  it seems like thatll be something we need if were ever to have full-size flying cars.\n\n"}

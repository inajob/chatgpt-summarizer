YOLO, as the kids say. Having decided that, one must decide what type of far-seer one will construct. For his 10 reflector, [Carl Anderson] once again said Yolo this time not as a slogan, but in reference to a little-known type of reflecting telescope.\nTelescope or sci-fi laser gun? YOLO, just try it.\nThe Yolo-pattern telescope was proposed by [Art Leonard] back in the 1960s, and was apparently named for a county in California. It differs from the standard Newtonian reflector in that it uses two concave spherical mirrors of very long radius to produce a light path with no obstructions. (This differs from the similar Schiefspiegler that uses a convex secondary.) The Yolo never caught on, in part because of the need to stretch the primary mirror in a warping rig to correct for coma and astigmatism.\n[Carl] doesnt bother with that, instead using modern techniques to precisely calculate and grind the required toric profile into the mirror. Grinding and polishing was done on motorized jigs [Carl] built, save for the very final polishing. (A quick demo video of the polishing machine is embedded below.)\nThe body of the telescope is a wooden truss, sheathed in plywood. Three-point mirror mounts alowed for the final adjustment. [Carl] seems to prefer observing by eye to astrophotography, as there are no photos through the telescope. Of course, an astrophotographer probably would not have built an F/15 (yes, fifteen) telescope to begin with. The view through the eyepiece on the rear end must be astounding.\nIf youre inspired to spend your one life scratch-building a telescope, but want something more conventional, check out this comprehensive guide. You can go bit more modern with 3D printed parts, but you probably dont want to try spin-casting resin mirrors. Or maybe you do: YOLO!\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\uff1aYOLO\u3067\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u7406\u7531", "body": "\u30ab\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u304c\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u300c\u30e8\u30ed\u300d\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u3002\u969c\u5bb3\u7269\u306e\u306a\u3044\u5149\u8def\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\uff1aYOLO\u3067\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u7406\u7531", "\u30e8\u30ed\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u6280\u8853\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u53cd\u5c04\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u6728\u88fd\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u30b3\u30c4", "\u5929\u4f53\u89b3\u6e2c\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\uff1a\u81ea\u4f5c\u671b\u9060\u93e1\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

Getting them in the proper order, now thats another story entirely. Sometimes youll find yourself staring at a blank page, struggling to sieve coherent thoughts from the screaming maelstrom swirling around in your head, for far longer than youd care to admit. Or so weve heard, anyway.\nUnfortunately, theres no cure for writers block. But many people find that limiting outside distractions helps to keep the mental gears turning, which is why [Un Kyu Lee] has been working on a series of specialized writing devices. The latest version of the Micro Journal, powered by the ESP32, goes a long way towards achieving his goals of an instant-on electronic notebook.\nThe writing experience on the Micro Journal is unencumbered by the normal distractions youd have on a computer or mobile device, as the device literally cant do anything but take user input and save it as a text file. We suppose you could achieve similar results with a pen and a piece of paperbut wheres the fun in that? These devices are more widely known as writerdecks, which is an extension of the popular cyberdeck concept of hyper-personalized computers.\nThis newest Micro Journal, which is the fourth iteration of the concept for anyone keeping score, packs a handwired 30% ortholinear keyboard, a 2.8 ILI9341 240320 LCD (with SD card slot), ESP32 dev board, and an 18650 battery with associated charging board into a minimalist 3D printed enclosure.\nUnable to find any suitable firmware to run on the device, [Un Kyu Lee] has developed his own open source text editor to run on the WiFi-enabled microcontroller. While the distraction-free nature of the Micro Journal naturally means the text editor itself is pretty spartan in terms of features, it does\u00a0 allow syncing files with Google Drive  making it exceptionally easy to access your distilled brilliance from the comfort of your primary computing device.\nWhile the earlier versions of the Micro Journal were impressive in their own way, we really love the stripped down nature of this ESP32 version. It reminds us a bit of the keezyboost40 and the EdgeProMX, both of which were entered into the 2022 Cyberdeck Contest.\n\n"}

Originally built by none other than Linus Torvalds for handling Linux kernel development, its branched out for use with all kinds of other projects. That being said, it is not the easiest thing to learn how to use, with tons of options, abstract ideas, and non-linear workflows to keep track of. So if youre new to the system or dont need all of its vast swath of features, you might want to try out an alternative like Gitless.\nThanks to the fact that the original Git is open source, its free to modify and use as any user sees fit, and there are plenty of options available. This one aims to simplify many of the features found in the original Git, implementing a tracking system which somewhat automates commits. It also includes a simplified branching system, making it easier to switch between branches and keep better track of all thats happening in a project. The command line interface is simplified as well, and the entire system is backwards-compatible with Git which means that if you find yourself needing some of the more advanced tools its possible to switch between them with relative ease.\nFor those of us keeping track of our own software projects, who dont necessarily need the full feature set that the original Git has to offer, this could be a powerful tool that decreases the steep learning curve that Git is known for. Its definitely a system work diving into, though, regardless of whichever implementation you choose. Its an effective tool for everything from complex, professional projects to small hobby projects on the Arduino.", "title": "Git\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044Gitless\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Git\u306f\u3001\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u3068\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u7ba1\u7406\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u30012000\u5e74\u4ee3\u534a\u3070\u304b\u3089\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u591a\u6570\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3084\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u975e\u76f4\u7dda\u7684\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u3001\u5b66\u7fd2\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002Gitless\u306fGit\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u8ffd\u8de1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3084\u7c21\u7565\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306a\u3069\u304c\u5b9f\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002Git\u3068\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3059\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5c02\u9580\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304b\u3089Arduino\u306a\u3069\u306e\u8da3\u5473\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u307e\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Git\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044Gitless\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "Gitless\uff1aGit\u3088\u308a\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u7ba1\u7406\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Gitless\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff1f", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eGit\uff1aGitless", "Arduino\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\uff01Gitless\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd"]}

And yet they did, but not without a lot of lambs bladders and sulfur globes, and not a little hand waving in the process. And urine  lots and lots of urine.\nLooking into these early electrical experiments and recreating them is the unlikely space [Sam Gallagher] has staked out with the Experimental History of Electricity, a growing playlist on his criminally undersubscribed YouTube channel. The video linked below is his latest, describing the apparatus one Francis Hauksbee used to generate static electric charges for his early 18th-century experiments. Hauksbees name is nowhere near as well-known as that of Otto von Guericke or William Gilbert, who in the two centuries before Hauksbee conducted their own experiments and who both make appearances in the series. But Hauksbees machine, a rotating glass globe charged by the lightest touch of a leather pad, which [Sam] does a fantastic job recreating as closely as possible using period-correct materials and methods, allowed him to explore the nature of electricity in much greater depth than his predecessors.\nBut what about the urine? As with many of the experiments at the time, alchemists used what they had to create the reagents they needed, and it turned out that urine was a dandy source of phosphorous, which gave off a brilliant light when sufficiently heated. The faint light given off by mercury when shaken in the vacuum within a barometer seemed similar enough that it became known as the mercurial phosphor that likely inspired Hauksbees electrical experiments, which when coupled with a vacuum apparatus nearly led to the invention of the mercury discharge lamp, nearly 200 years early. The more you know.\n\nThanks to [RoGeorge] for the tip.", "title": "18\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u751f\u6210\u88c5\u7f6e", "body": "\u521d\u671f\u306e\u96fb\u6c17\u5b9f\u9a13\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305fYouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u300cExperimental History of Electricity\u300d\u300218\u4e16\u7d00\u521d\u982d\u306eFrancis Hauksbee\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u751f\u6210\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u518d\u73fe\u3084\u5c3f\u306e\u8a71\u306a\u3069\u3001\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u5185\u5bb9\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["18\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u751f\u6210\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u53f2\u3092\u305f\u3069\u308b", "\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\uff1a\u30cf\u30a6\u30af\u30b9\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u88c5\u7f6e", "\u9759\u96fb\u6c17\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u5c3f\u7d20\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2", "YouTube\u3067\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u96fb\u6c17\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u53f2"]}

This 1D implementation by [newsonator] is about as exciting as it gets.\nIt works like youd probably expect  the light moves back and forth between the two players. Keep it in the green and you have a nice, gentle volley going. Let it hit your red LED and youve lost a point. But if you can push your button while your yellow LED is lit, the light speeds up tremendously until the next button press in the green.\nOur only wish is that subsequent yellow-light button presses would make it speed up even more. But there are really just the two speeds with the current programming.\nInside the cool laser-cut box is an Arduino Uno and a 9V battery, plus a current-limiting resistor and the all-important buzzer. We like how [newsonator] wired up the LEDs to the Arduino by soldering them to a row of header pins and sticking\u00a0that into the Arduino so it can be used in other projects down the line. We also like how [newsonator] shoved a couple of dowels through the box to ultimately support the two buttons.\nCheck out the intro video after the break for the overall details. The build is done over a few different short videos which follow.\nAlthough this is pretty small, it isnt quite the minimum viable.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

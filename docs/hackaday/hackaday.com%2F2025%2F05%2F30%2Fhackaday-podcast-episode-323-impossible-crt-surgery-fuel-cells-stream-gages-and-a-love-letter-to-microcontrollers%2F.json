We kicked things off with a look at the news, including a potentially exciting Right to Repair law in Washington state and the sad demise of NASAs ISS sighting website.\nOur choice of hacks included a fond look at embedded systems and the classic fashion sense of Cornells Bruce Land, risky open CRT surgery, a very strange but very cool way to make music, and the ultimate backyard astronomers observatory. We talked about Stamp collecting for SMD prototyping, crushing aluminum with a boatload of current, a PC that heats your seat, and bringing HDMI to the Commodore 64.\nWe also took a look at flight tracking IRL, a Flipper-based POV, the ultimate internet toaster, and printing SVGs for fun and profit. Finally, we wrapped things up with a look at the tech behind real-time river flow tracking and a peek inside the surprisingly energetic world of fuel cells.\n\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\nDownload this entirely innocent-looking MP3.\n\nEpisode 323 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nWashington Consumers Gain Right To Repair For Cellphones And More\nNASA Is Shutting Down The International Space Station Sighting Website\n2025 Pet Hacks Contest\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out this form for your chance to win!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nA Love Letter To Embedded Systems By V.

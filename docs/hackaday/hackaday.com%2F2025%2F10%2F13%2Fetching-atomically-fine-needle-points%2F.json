A molten plastic extruder would be impractical at such small scales, even if a hobbyist could manufacture one small enough, so instead [Vik]\u2019s working on a system that uses a very fine needle point to place tiny droplets of UV resin on a substrate. These points have to be sharper than anything readily available, so his latest experiments have focused on electrochemically etching his own needles.\nThe needles start with a fine wire, which a 3D-printed bracket holds hanging down into a beaker of electrolyte, where another electrode is located. By applying a few volts across the circuit, with the wire acting as an anode, electrochemical erosion eventually wears through the wire and it drops off, leaving an atomically sharp point. Titanium wire performs best, but Nichrome and stainless steel also work. Copper wire doesn\u2019t work, and by extension, nor does the plated copper wire sometimes sold as \u201cstainless steel\u201d by sketchy online merchants.\nThe electrolyte was made from either a 5% sodium chloride solution or 1% nitric acid. The salt solution produced a very thin, fine point, but also produced a cloudy suspension of metal hydroxides around the wire, which made it hard to tell when the wire had broken off. The goal of nitric acid was to prevent hydroxide formation; it produced a shorter, blunter tip with a pitted shaft, but it simply etched the tip of the wire to a point, with the rest of the wire never dropping off. Some experimentation revealed that a mixture of the two electrolyte solutions struck a good balance which etched fine points like the pure salt solution, but also avoided cloudy precipitates.\nIf you\u2019re interested in seeing more of the RepRapMicron, we\u2019ve looked at a previous iteration which scribed a minuscule Jolly Wrencher in marker ink. On a more macro scale, we\u2019ve also seen one 3D printer which used a similar resin deposition scheme.", "title": "- \u6975\u5c0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bRepRapMicron\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "Vik Olliver\u306f\u3001\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u7528\u306e\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u91dd\u3092\u958b\u767a\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u6975\u5c0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bRepRapMicron\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u8d85\u7d30\u91dd\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- UV\u6a39\u8102\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u5fae\u7d30\u69cb\u9020\u5370\u5237\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u30ca\u30c8\u30ea\u30a6\u30e0\u5869\u6c34\u3068\u785d\u9178\u306e\u6df7\u5408\u6db2\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u8da3\u5473\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u91dd\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

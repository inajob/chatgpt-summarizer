The result? Owl-Vision squashes a full 360\u00b0 of un-distorted horizontal visual perception into 90\u00b0 of neck travel to either side. One can see all around oneself, without needing to physically turn ones head any further than is natural.\nIts still a work in progress, and accessing the paper currently doesnt have a free option, but the demonstration video at that link (also embedded below) gives a solid overview of whats going on.\n\nThe user wears a VR headset with a 360\u00b0 camera perched on their head. This camera has a fisheye lens on the front and back, and stitches the inputs together to make a 360\u00b0 panorama. The headset shows the user a segment of this panorama as a normal camera view, but the twist is that the effect from turning ones head is amplified.\nTurning ones head 45 degrees to the left displays as though ones head turned 90 degrees, and turning 90 degrees (i.e. looking straight left) displays the view directly behind. One therefore compresses an entire 360 degrees of horizontal visual awareness into the normal 180 degree range of neck motion for a person, without having to resort to visual distortions like squashing the video.\nIn a way this calls to mind the experiments of American psychologist George Stratton, whose fascinating work in visual perception involved wearing special eyeglasses that inverted or mirrored his sight. After a few days, he was able to function normally. Owl-Vision seems very much along those lines, albeit much less intensive. Its apparently quite intuitive to use, with wearers needing very little time to become accustomed. Messing with perception via VR has gone the other way, too. Adding lag to real life is remarkably debilitating for interactive tasks.\nThe short video demo for Owl-Vision also includes a driving simulator demo in which the driver shows off the ability to look directly behind themselves with ease.\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ahs2024-40.mp4\n[Video: Owl-Vision: Augmentation of Visual Field by Virtual Amplification of Head Rotation, Augmented Humans International Conference 2024]", "title": "VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6210\u679c", "body": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u5e02\u8ca9\u306eVR360\u5ea6\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3001\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3001\u9996\u3092\u56de\u3059\u7bc4\u56f2\u3092\u62e1\u5927\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002360\u00b0\u8996\u754c\u309290\u00b0\u30cd\u30c3\u30af\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30eb\u306b\u5727\u7e2e\u3057\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u9996\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u5468\u56f2\u3092\u898b\u6e21\u305b\u308b\u3002\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u9023\u60f3\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u753b\u671f\u7684\u306a\u5b9f\u9a13\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6210\u679c", "Owl-Vision: \u982d\u90e8\u56de\u8ee2\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u5897\u5e45\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8996\u91ce\u306e\u62e1\u5f35", "\u30aa\u30a6\u30eb\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\uff1a360\u00b0\u306e\u8996\u899a\u77e5\u899a\u309290\u00b0\u306e\u9996\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u53ce\u7d0d", "\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b8\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3\u6c0f\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u5f77\u5f7f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u8996\u899a\u6280\u8853", "\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u8996\u899a\u62e1\u5f35\uff1aVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068"]}

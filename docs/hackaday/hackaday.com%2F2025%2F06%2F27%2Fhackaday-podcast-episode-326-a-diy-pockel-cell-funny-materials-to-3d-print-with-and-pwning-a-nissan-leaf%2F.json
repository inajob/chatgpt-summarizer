Both of our fans and air conditioners made enough noise to be picked up on the microphone when they were turned on, so were suffering for your entertainment.\nThe big Hackaday news stories of the week are twofold, firstly a cat-themed set of winners for the 2025 Pet Hacks contest, and then the announcement of a fresh competition: the 2025 Hackaday One Hertz Challenge. Get your once-a-second projects ready!\nThis week gave us a nice pile of interesting hacks, including some next-level work growing and machining the crystal for a home-made Pockels cell light valve, an pcoming technique for glass 3D prints, and enough vulnerabilities to make any Nissan Leaf owner nervous. We note that mechanical 7-segment displays are an arena showing excellent hacks, and were here for it.\nMeanwhile among the quick hacks a filament made of PLA with a PETG core caught Elliots eye, while Jenny was impressed with a beautifully-made paper tape punch. Finally in the cant miss section, The latest in Dan Maloneys Mining and Refining series looks at drilling and blasting. Such an explosive piece should come last, but wait! Theres more! Al Williams gives us a potted history of satellite phones, and explains why you dont carry an Iridium in your pocket.\n\nOr download it your own fine self.

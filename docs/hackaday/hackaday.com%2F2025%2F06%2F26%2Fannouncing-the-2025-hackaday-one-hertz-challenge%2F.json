Or maybe it\u2019s about time\u2019s reciprocal: frequency. Whichever way you see it, Hackaday is pleased to announce, just this very second, the 2025 One Hertz Challenge over on Hackaday.io. If you\u2019ve got a device that does something once per second, we\u2019ve got the contest for you. And don\u2019t delay, because the top three winners will each receive a $150 gift certificate from this contests sponsor: DigiKey.\nWhat will you do once per second? And how will you do it? Therein lies the contest! We brainstormed up a few honorable mention categories to get your creative juices flowing.\n\nTimelords: How precisely can you get that heartbeat? This category is for those who prefer to see a lot of zeroes after the decimal point.\nRidiculous: This category is for the least likely thing to do once per second. Accuracy is great, but absurdity is king here. Have Rube Goldberg dreams? Now you get to live them out.\nClockwork: It\u2019s hard to mention time without thinking of timepieces. This category is for the clockmakers among you. If your clock ticks at a rate of one hertz, and you\u2019re willing to show us the mechanism, you\u2019re in.\nCould Have Used a 555: We knew you were going to say it anyway, so we made it an honorable mention category. If your One Hertz project gets its timing from the venerable triple-five, it belongs here.\n\nWe love contests with silly constraints, because you all tend to rise to the challenge. At the same time, the door is wide open to your creativity. To enter, all you have to do is document your project over on Hackaday.io and pull down the \u201cContests\u201d tab to One Hertz to enter. New projects are awesome, but if you\u2019ve got an oldie-but-goodie, you can enter it as well. (Heck, maybe use this contest as your inspiration to spruce it up a bit?)\nTime waits for no one, and you have until August 19th at 9:00 AM Pacific time to get your entry in. We can\u2019t wait to see what you come up with."}

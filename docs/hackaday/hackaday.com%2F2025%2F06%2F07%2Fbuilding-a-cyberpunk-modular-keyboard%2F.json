Perhaps youve been hunting for a keyboard that you can position perfectly to suit both your left and right hands. In that case, you might just like this nifty design from [Modern Hobbyist].\nThe first thing youll note is the split design, which allows each half of the keyboard to be placed optimally for each arms comfort. Theyre linked with a cable, which allows the STM32 microcontroller to read the keys on both sides and then spit out the right stuff upstream over its USB-C connection. The microcontroller is also in charge of running the per-key LED lighting and the LCD screens on each half.\nThe board owes its sleek and slim design at least in part to using Kailh Choc low-profile switches. They plug in to hotswap compatible sockets so the switches can easily be changed if desired. Keycaps are blank off-the-shelf parts because this is a keyboard for those who arent afraid to spend the time establishing the right muscle memory. It might take some adaptation if youre not used to the staggered columnar layout. However, the LCD screens can display a keymap if you need a little help now and then.\nWeve seen a lot of great split keyboards over the years, including one amusing design made by hacking an existing keyboard in half with a saw.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u5206\u5272\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "body": "\u5206\u5272\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u80fd\u3067LED\u7167\u660e\u3084LCD\u753b\u9762\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u5206\u5272\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- \u5de6\u53f3\u72ec\u7acb\u914d\u7f6e\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30a8\u30eb\u30b4\u30ce\u30df\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- STM32\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u4f4e\u3044Kailh Choc\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u63a1\u7528\u306e\u30b9\u30ea\u30e0\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- LCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff01\u30ad\u30fc\u914d\u7f6e\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u5206\u5272\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9"]}

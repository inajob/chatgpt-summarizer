Dont worry, theyll tell you. There is a move to put Rust everywhere, even in the Linux kernel. Not going fast enough for you? Then check out\u00a0Asterinas  an effort to create a Linux-compatible kernel totally in Rust.\nThe goal is to improve memory safety and, to that end, the project describes what they call a framekernel. Historically kernels have been either monolithic, all in one piece, or employ a microkernel architecture where only bits and pieces load.\nA framekernel is similar to a microkernel, but some services are not allowed to use unsafe Rust. This minimizes the amount of code that  in theory  could crash memory safety. If you want to know more, there is impressive documentation. You can find the code on GitHub.\nWill it work? It is certainly possible. Is it worth it? Time will tell. Our experience is that no matter how many safeguards you put on code, theres no cure-all that prevents bad programming. Of course, to take the contrary argument, seat belts dont stop all traffic fatalities, but you could just choose not to have accidents. So we do have seat belts. If Rust can prevent some mistakes or malicious intent, maybe its worth it even if it isnt perfect.\nWant to understand Rust? Got ten minutes?"}

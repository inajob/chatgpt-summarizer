Or in your hackerspace, or even just to a bunch of fellow nerds whenever you can. When you give the talk, don\u2019t be afraid to make it too \u201ceasy\u201d to understand. Making a tough topic comprehensible is often the sign that you really understand it, after all, and it\u2019s also a fantastic service to the audience. And also don\u2019t be afraid that your talk isn\u2019t \u201chard core\u201d enough, because with a diverse enough crowd, there will absolutely be folks for whom it\u2019s still entirely new, and they\u2019ll be thankful.\nThese were the conclusions I got from talking to a whole range of people at Chaos Communication Camp the weekend before last, and it\u2019s one of the great opportunities when you go to an event like this. At Camp, there were a number of simultaneous stages, and with so many talks that new ones are still being released. That meant that everyone had their chance to say their bit, and many many did.\nAnd that\u2019s great. Because it\u2019s obvious that getting the work done, or diving deep into a particular topic, is part of the hacker experience, but it\u2019s also equally important to share what you\u2019ve gained with the rest of the community. The principle of spreading the knowledge is a cornerstone of our culture, and getting people up to talk about what they\u2019ve learned is the manifestation of this cultural value. If you know something, say something!\nOf course, when you\u2019re not at a conference, you could be writing up your hacks and sending them in to the tips line (hint, hint!). That\u2019ll work too.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

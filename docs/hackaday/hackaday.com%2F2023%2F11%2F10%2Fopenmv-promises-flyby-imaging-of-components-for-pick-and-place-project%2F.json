The answer seems to be yes!\nThe OpenMV camera module does capture, blob detection, LCD output, and more.\nThe H7 is OpenMVs most recent device, and it supports a variety of useful add-ons such as a global shutter camera sensor, which [iforce2d] is using here. OpenMV has some absolutely fantastic hardware, and is able to snap the image, do blob detection (and other image processing), display on a small LCD, and send all the relevant data over the UART as well as accept commands on what to look for, all in one neat package.\nIt used to be that global shutter cameras were pretty specialized pieces of equipment, but theyre much more common now. Theres even a Raspberry Pi global shutter camera module, and its just so much nicer for machine vision applications.\nWatch the test setup as [iforce2d] demonstrates and explains an early proof of concept. The metal fixture on the motor swings over the cameras lens with a ring light for even illumination, and despite the moving object, the H7 gets an awfully nice image. Check it out in the video, embedded below.\n\n"}

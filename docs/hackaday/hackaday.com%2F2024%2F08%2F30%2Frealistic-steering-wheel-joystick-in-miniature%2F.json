You want something that looks and feels closer to the real thing. The major downsides to these more elaborate input methods is that they take up a large amount of space, requiring extra time for setup, and can be quite expensive as well. To solve both of these problems [Rahel zahir Ali] created a miniature steering wheel controller for some of his favorite games.\nWhile there are some commercial offerings of small steering wheels integrated into an otherwise standard video game controller and a few 3D printed homebrew options, nothing really felt like a true substitute. The main design goal with this controller was to maintain the 900-degree rotation of a standard car steering wheel in a smaller size. It uses a 600P/R rotary encoder attached to a knob inside of a printed case, with two spring-loaded levers to act as a throttle and brake, as well as a standard joystick to adjust camera angle and four additional buttons. Everything is wired together with an Arduino Leonardo that sends the inputs along to the computer.\nNow hes ready to play some of his favorite games and includes some gameplay footage using this controller in the video linked below. If youre racing vehicles other than cars and trucks, though, you might want a different type of controller for your games instead.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3001\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5411\u3051\u306b\u3001\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3002\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u3092\u7e2e\u5c0f\u3057\u3064\u3064\u3001900\u5ea6\u306e\u56de\u8ee2\u3068\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u3068\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002Arduino Leonardo\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf\u3082\u516c\u958b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30df\u30cb\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u5c0f\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7528\u30df\u30cb\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5c0f\u578b\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

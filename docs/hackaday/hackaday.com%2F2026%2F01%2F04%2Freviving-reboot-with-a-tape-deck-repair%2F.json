If you were into early CGI, the name probably rings a bell, since when it premiered in 1994 it was the first fully computer-animated show on TV. Some time ago, a group found a pile of tapes from Mainframe Studios in Canada, the people behind ReBoot, and the computer historians amongst us were very excited until they turned out to be digital broadcast master tapes. Exciting for fans of lost media, sure, but not quite the LTO backups of Mainframes SGI workstations some of us had hoped would turn up. Still, [Mark Westhaver], [Bryan Baker] and others at the ReBoot Rewind project have made great strides, to the point that in their latest update video they declare We Saved ReBoot\nWhat does it take to revive a 30-year-old television project? Well, as stated, they started with the tapes. These arent ordinary VHS tapes: the Sony D-1 tapes, which were also known by the moniker 4:2:2, are a format that most people who didnt work in the TV or film industry will have never seen, and the tape decks are rare as hens teeth these days. Just getting a working one, and keeping it working, was one of the biggest challenges [Mark] and Reboot Rewind faced. In the end it took three somewhat-dodgy machines long past their service lives and a miraculously located spare read/write head to get a stable scanning rate.\nThe uncompressed digital output of these tapes isnt something you can just burn to a DVD, either. The 720 \u00d7 576 resolution video stream is captured raw, but there are minor editing tweaks that need to be made in addition to tape errors that have cropped up over the years, and those need to be dealt with before the video and audio data gets encoded into a modern format. The video briefly glosses [Bryan Baker]s workflow to do just that. At least they arent stuck with terrible USB video capture dongles VHS lovers have to deal with. Even if you dont care about ReBoot,\u00a0this isnt the only show that was archived on D1 tapes so that workflow might be of interest to media fans.\nWe covered ReBoot Rewind when they were first searching for tape decks, so its great to have an update. Alas, the rights holders havent yet decided how exactly theyre going to release this fine footage, so if like this author you have fond memories of ReBoot,\u00a0you may have to wait a bit longer for a reWatch.\n\n"}

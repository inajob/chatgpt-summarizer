Instead, it ticks away at random increments to infuriate those that perceive it, whilst keeping regular time over the long term. [iracigt] decided to whip up a real world version of this hilarious fictional timepiece.\nThe clock itself is an off-the-shelf timepiece purchased from Target for the princely sum of $5. However, its been deviously modified with an RP2040 microcontroller hidden away inside. The RP2040 is programmed to tick the clock at an\u00a0average\u00a0of once per second. But each tick itself is not so exact. Instead, theres an erraticness to its beat  some ticks are longer, some shorter, in the classic Vetinari style. [iracigt] explains the nitty gritty of how it all works, from creating chaos with Markov chains to interfacing the RP2040 electronically with the cheap quartz clock movement.\nIf youve ever wanted to build one of these amusements yourself, [iracigts] writeup is a great place to start. Even better, it was inspired by an earlier post on these very pages! We love to see the community riff on a theme, and wed love to see yours, too  so keep the tips coming, yeah? Video after the break.\n\n"}

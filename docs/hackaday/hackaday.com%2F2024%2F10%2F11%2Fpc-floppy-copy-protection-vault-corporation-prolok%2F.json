This situation is a surprisingly new one, and in an earlier era of consumer software it was most often an expensive purchase. An anti-piracy industry sprang up as manufacturers tried to protect their products, and its one of those companies that [GloriousCow] examines in detail, following their trajectory from an initial success through to an ignominious failure driven by an anti-piracy tech too extreme even for the software industry.\nVault Corporation made a splash in the marketplace with Prolok, a copy protection system for floppies that worked by creating a physically damaged area of the disc which wouldnt be present on a regular floppy. The write-up goes into detail about the workings of the system, including how to circumvent a Prolok protected title if you find one. This last procedure resulted in a lawsuit between Prolok and Quaid Software, one of the developers of circumvention tools, which established the right of Americans to make backup copies of their owned software.\nThe downfall of Vault Corporation came with their disastrously misjudged Prolok Plus product, which promised to implant a worm on the hard disks of pirates and delete all their files in an act of punishment. Sensing the huge reputational damage of being tied to such a product the customers stayed away, and the company drifted into obscurity.\nFor those interested further in the world of copy protection from this era, weve previously covered the similar deep dives that [GloriousCow] has done on Softguard\u2019s Superlok as well as the Interlock system from Electronic Arts.", "title": "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u5931\u6557: Vault Corporation\u306e\u8208\u4ea1", "body": "2020\u5e74\u4ee3\u306f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u304c\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u7121\u6599\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u304b\u3064\u3066\u306f\u9ad8\u984d\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e0d\u6b63\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u3084\u30d7\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u8208\u4ea1\u3092\u8ffd\u3046\u3002Vault Corporation\u304c\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4e0d\u6b63\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u3092\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3082\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u5931\u6557: Vault Corporation\u306e\u8208\u4ea1", "Prolok: \u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u4fdd\u8b77\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u8aac", "Vault Corporation\u306e\u5931\u6557: Prolok Plus\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u7d50\u672b", "\u30a2\u30f3\u30c1\u30d4\u30e9\u30b7\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u3068\u8ee2\u843d: Vault Corporation\u306e\u904b\u547d", "GloriousCow\u306e\u8abf\u67fb\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba: \u30b3\u30d4\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8208\u4ea1"]}

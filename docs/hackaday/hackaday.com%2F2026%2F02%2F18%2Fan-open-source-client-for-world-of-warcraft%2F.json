Millions of players continue to login every month. [Kelsi Davis] is one such player, but she doesnt always log in with the regular client anymore. Thats because she put together WoWee\u2014an open-source alternative of her very own.\nWoWee is an acronym\u2014World of Warcraft Engine Experiment. Coded in native C++, its a homebrewed client that uses a custom OpenGL renderer to display the game world. [Kelsi] notes that its strictly an educational/research project, built without using any official Blizzard assets, data or code. Instead, it grabs some client data from a legally-obtained install to operate and loads certain assets this way.\nIts currently compatible with the vanilla game as well as The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions. It should be highlighted how much work this project has already involved\u2014with [Kelsi] needing to recreate various functional minutae in the game, from character creation screens to weather systems and skyboxes. Theres still a lot to do, as well, like adding 3D audio support and making it more interoperable with the quest system.\nIts rare that any MMO gets an open-source client, even less so while the original game is still being actively supported by the developers. Still, we do see some creative hacks in this space.\n\n", "title": "- WoWee: \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eWorld of Warcraft\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8", "body": "Kelsi Davis\u306f\u3001World of Warcraft\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u300cWoWee\u300d\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u76ee\u7684\u3067\u6cd5\u7684\u306b\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- WoWee: \u81ea\u4f5c\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eWorld of Warcraft\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8", "- Kelsi\u306b\u3088\u308bWOW\u3092\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u6559\u80b2/\u7814\u7a76\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Blizzard\u8cc7\u7523\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u305a\u306b\u4f5c\u3063\u305fWoWee\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6", "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308bWoWee\u306e\u958b\u767a\u904e\u7a0b", "- MMO\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u8a66\u307f"]}

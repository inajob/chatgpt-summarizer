Break the terms, and they\u2019ll repossess your TV. If you don\u2019t give them the TV, they have your credit card on record and they think the set is worth $1,000.\nThe hacker in me sees free hardware, so I checked out the terms and conditions, and it doesn\u2019t look good. They\u2019ve explicitly ruled out opening up or physically modifying the device, and it has to continually have WiFi \u2013 for which you pay, naturally. It sounds like it could easily tell if you try to tamper with it. My next thought was, perhaps too cynically, to get one, put it in the closet, and wait for the company to go bankrupt. Because you know that business model isnt going to last.\nBut it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ve seen through me. The most bizarre clause is that you have to \u201cUse the Product as the primary television in Your household\u201d. Now, we\u2019re not lawyers, but it seems like an amazing stretch that they can tell you how intensively you are to use the product. Can you imagine a license with a keyboard that demanded that you only use it to write sci-fi novels, or that you have to use it more than any other keyboard?\nNope. Too many hoops to jump through for a silly free TV. You can keep your dystopian future.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

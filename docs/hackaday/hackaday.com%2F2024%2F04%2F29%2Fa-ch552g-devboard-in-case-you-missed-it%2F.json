Just so you know, heres a Hackaday.io project you should check out  a CH552G devboard thats as simple as it sufficient, in case you needed a tangible reminder that this chip exists, has a lively community, and is very much an option for your projects.\nThe devboard design by [Dylan Turner] is so straightforward, its almost inspiring  a square of PCB with the chip in the center and plenty of empty space for your mods. Everything is open-source with KiCad sources stored on GitHub. The most lovely aspect of this board, no doubt, is having the pin mapping written on the bottom, with all the alternate pin functions  you wont have to constantly glance at the datasheet while wiring this one up. Plus, of course, theres the microUSB port for programming, and the programming mode button that a few CH552 projects tend to lack.\nIts simple, its self-documenting, its breadboardable, and its definitely worth putting into the shopping cart at your PCB fab of choice. Oh, and there are bringup instructions on GitHub, in case you need them. Whether you want to prototype the cheapest macropad or keyboard ever, or perhaps a reflow hotplate, the CH552 delivers. If these CH552 projects arent enough to light your fire, here are\u00a0a dozen more."}

Well, if you are [Artifextron], you get the NTRON. Part Nintendo console, part chip tune synthesizer, and part objet dart. You can see the device do its things in the video below.\nThis is less of a bare metal design and more of a synthesis of parts, but it is a very clever system design using audio mixers and an assortment of modules to do its tasks. It does have an IC handling the gamepad ports. Of course, it also features a ton of 3D printed parts.\n\nNot only is the build excellent-looking, but the documentation is painstakingly detailed. If the old Heathkit manuals were a perfect 10, this one is easily in the 7.5 to 8 range. Pictures, diagrams, and links for the materials are all there. It should be reasonably easy to replicate one of the variants described in the manual.\nOverall, a great fusion of items in a gorgeous presentation. Maybe enough time to get one made to give as a holiday gift. Chiptune is definitely a thing. We see plenty of RetroPie projects, some of which dont even use a Pi.\n"}

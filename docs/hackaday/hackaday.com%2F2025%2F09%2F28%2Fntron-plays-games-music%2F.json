Well, if you are [Artifextron], you get the NTRON. Part Nintendo console, part chip tune synthesizer, and part objet dart. You can see the device do its things in the video below.\nThis is less of a bare metal design and more of a synthesis of parts, but it is a very clever system design using audio mixers and an assortment of modules to do its tasks. It does have an IC handling the gamepad ports. Of course, it also features a ton of 3D printed parts.\n\nNot only is the build excellent-looking, but the documentation is painstakingly detailed. If the old Heathkit manuals were a perfect 10, this one is easily in the 7.5 to 8 range. Pictures, diagrams, and links for the materials are all there. It should be reasonably easy to replicate one of the variants described in the manual.\nOverall, a great fusion of items in a gorgeous presentation. Maybe enough time to get one made to give as a holiday gift. Chiptune is definitely a thing. We see plenty of RetroPie projects, some of which dont even use a Pi.\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u878d\u5408\u300cNTRON\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fNTRON\u306f\u3001\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u3082\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306f\u5de7\u5999\u3067\u3001\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3068\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u306e\u878d\u5408\u300cNTRON\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6301\u3064NTRON\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u97f3\u697d\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\uff01NTRON\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fNTRON\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u300cNTRON\u300d"]}

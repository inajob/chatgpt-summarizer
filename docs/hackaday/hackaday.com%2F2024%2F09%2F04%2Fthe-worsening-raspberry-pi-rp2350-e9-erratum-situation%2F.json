Recorded in the RP2350 datasheet as erratum RP2350-E9, it was originally reported as only being related to the use of internal pull-downs, but [Ian] has since demonstrated in the primary issue ticket on GitHub that the same soft latching behavior on GPIO pins occurs also without pull-downs enabled.\nWhen we first reported on this hardware bug in the RP2350s A2 (and likely preceding) stepping there was still a lot of confusion about what this issue meant, but so far we have seen the Bus Pirate delay and projects like [Agust\u00edn Gimenez Bernad]s LogicAnalyzer have opted for taking the RP2350 port out back. There are also indications that the ADC and PIO peripherals are affected by this issue, with workarounds only partially able to circumvent the hardware issue.\nIn the case of the Bus Pirate a potential workaround is the addition of 4.7 kOhm external pull-downs, but at the cost of 0.7 mA continuous load on the GPIO when pulled high and part of that when pulled low. Although a final solution for Bus Pirate is still being investigated, this kind of ugly hardware hack might at least save existing boards. It also shows the lengths that hardware developers who seek to use this MCU have to go to to make it work.\nMeanwhile there are lively discussions about the issue on the Raspberry Pi forums, both on the E9 erratum as well as the question of when there will be a new stepping. The official statement by Raspberry Pi is still that they are investigating. Presumably there will be a Bx stepping at some point, but for now it is clear that the RP2350s A2 stepping is probably best avoided.", "title": "Raspberry Pi RP2350\u306eGPIO\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u554f\u984c\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8abf\u67fb", "body": "RP2350-E9\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u306eGPIO\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u554f\u984c\u304c\u8abf\u67fb\u4e2d\u3002Bus Pirate\u306e\u7d0d\u54c1\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u304c\u691c\u8a0e\u4e2d\u3002Raspberry Pi\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e9\u30e0\u3067\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u6d3b\u767a\u306a\u8b70\u8ad6\u4e2d\u3002RP2350-A2\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u56de\u907f\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3068\u306e\u610f\u898b\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi RP2350\u306eGPIO\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u554f\u984c\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8abf\u67fb", "Bus Pirate\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3067\u306eRP2350-E9\u554f\u984c\u306e\u30c7\u30e2", "RP2350 microcontroller\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30d0\u30b0\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u77e5\u898b", "GPIO\u30d4\u30f3\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u73fe\u8c61\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8abf\u67fb", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306b\u3088\u308bRP2350\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u8a66\u307f"]}

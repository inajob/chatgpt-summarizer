When it comes to [soiboi soft]s squishy robots, it thus makes sense to turn the typical semiconductor control circuitry into an air-powered version as much as possible.\nWe previously featured the soft and squishy salamander robot that [soiboi] created using pneumatic muscles. While rather agile, it still has to drag a whole umbilical of pneumatic tubes along, with one tube per function. Most of the research is on microfluidics, but fortunately air is just a fluid thats heavily challenged in the density department, allowing the designs to be adapted to create structures like gates and resistors.\nA transistor or valve using a silicone membrane. (Credit: soiboi soft, YouTube)\nLogically, a voltage potential or a pressure differential isnt so different, and can be used in a similar way. A transistor for example is akin to the vacuum tube, which in British English is called a valve for good reason. Through creative use of a flexible silicone membrane and rigid channels, pulling a vacuum in the gate channel allows flow through the other two channels.\nSimilarly, a resistor is simply a narrowing of a channel, thus resisting flow. The main difference compared to the microfluidics versions is everything is a much larger scale. This does make it printable on a standard FDM printer, which is a major benefit.\nQuantifying these pneumatic resistors took a bit of work, using a pressure sensor to determine their impact, but after that the first pneumatic logic circuits could be designed. The resistors are useful here as pull-downs, to ensure that any charge (air) is removed, while not impeding activation.\nThe design, as shown in the top image, is a 5-stage ring oscillator that provides locomotion to a set of five pneumatic muscles. As demonstrated at the end of video, this design allows for the entire walking motion to be powered using a single input of compressed air, not unlike the semiconductor equivalent running off a battery.\nWhile the somewhat bulky nature of pneumatic logic prevents it from implementing very complex logic, using it for implementing something as predictable as a walking pattern as demonstrated seems like an ideal use case. When it comes to making these squishy robots stand-alone, it likely can reduce the overall bulk of the package, not to mention the power usage. We are looking forward to how [soiboi]s squishy robots develop and integrate these pneumatic circuits.\n\n", "title": "\u30a8\u30a2\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8ad6\u7406\u56de\u8def", "body": "\u6c34\u3084\u7a7a\u6c17\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8ad6\u7406\u56de\u8def\u306e\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u5727\u529b\u5dee\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u5316\u3068\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a8\u30a2\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u8ad6\u7406\u56de\u8def", "\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u819c\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u67d4\u3089\u304b\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u6280\u8853", "\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7a7a\u6c17\u5f0f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf", "\u30d1\u30cb\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u8ad6\u7406\u56de\u8def\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u52d5\u4f5c", "\u811a\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\uff01\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c17\u3067\u99c6\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a6\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8"]}

The lower end of the market is filled with cheap but capable scopes that get the job done, as long as the job doesnt get too far up the spectrum. Thats where fancier scopes with active probes might be required, and such things are budget-busters for mere mortals.\nThen again, something like this open source 2 GHz active probe might be able to change the dynamics a bit. It comes to us from [James Wilson], who began tinkering with the design back in 2022. Thats when he learned about the chip at the center of this build: the BUF802. Its a wide-bandwidth, high-input-impedance JFET buffer that seemed perfect for the job, and designed a high-impedance, low-capacitance probe covering DC to 2 GHz probe with 10:1 attenuation around it.\n[James] blog post on the design and build reads like a lesson in high-frequency design. The specifics are a little above our pay grade, but the overall design uses both the BUF802 and an OPA140 precision op-amp. The low-offset op-amp buffers DC and lower frequencies, leaving higher frequencies to the BUF802. A lot of care was put into the four-layer PCB design, as well as ample use of simulation to make sure everything would work. Particularly interesting was the use of openEMS to tweak the width of the output trace to hit the desired 50 ohm impedance.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b92 GHz\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "body": "\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u5e2f\u306e\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u5341\u5206\u3067\u3001\u9ad8\u3044\u5468\u6ce2\u6570\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9ad8\u7d1a\u306a\u3082\u306e\u306f\u4e88\u7b97\u7684\u306b\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u30012022\u5e74\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u59cb\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e2 GHz\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306f\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u306fBUF802\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6280\u8853\u60c5\u5831\u3082\u8c4a\u5bcc\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b92 GHz\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u69cb\u7bc9", "BUF802\u3092\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3068\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u9ad8\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3001\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u8a2d\u8a08\u3092\u5b66\u3076\uff1a\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f"]}

A popular computer in Britain and beyond, but now rather thin on the ground. If you cant find one, fear not, for now\u2014you can apparently build a new one with new parts! [TME Retro] is here to demonstrate how.\nBefore you get excited, no\u2014Sinclair has not risen from the dead. Instead, its simply down to the state of the retrocomputing community. There are enough reproduction parts and components out there for the ZX Spectrum that its now possible to assemble the whole computer from new bits. You can get new cases and new mechanical keyboards, and a 100% compatible motherboard in the form of the Harlequin board. The latter even reproduces the unobtainable Spectrum ULA glue logic chip in raw logic!\nIts neat to see the ZX Spectrum live on decades after the production lines ground to a halt. Weve seen similar feats achieved with the legendary Commodore 64; youd think we had enough of them given they were the best-selling computer of all time.

He uses an e-paper photo frame as a weather map!\nBy now you are probably aware of e-paper technology, which is very low power tech for displaying images. E-paper only uses energy when it changes its display, it doesnt draw power to maintain a picture it has already rendered. The particular e-paper used in this example is fairly large (as e-paper goes) and supports color (not just black and white) which is why its expensive. For about US$100 you can get a 5.7 7-color EPD display with 600 x 448 pixels.\n\nBeyond the Inky Frame 5.7 hardware this particular hack is mostly a software job. The first program, written in python, collects weather data from the UK Met Office. Once that image data is available a BASH script is run to process the image files with imagemagick. Finally a Micro Python script runs on the Pico to download the correct file based on the setting of the real-time clock, and update the e-paper display with the weather map.\nThanks to [Simon] for sending this one in via the tipsline. If you have your own tips, please do let us know!

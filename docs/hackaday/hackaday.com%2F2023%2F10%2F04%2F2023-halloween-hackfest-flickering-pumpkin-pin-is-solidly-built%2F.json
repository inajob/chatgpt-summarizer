Thats not the point. The point is that this flickering pumpkin pin is nicely-built as well as being open source.\nEven though its fully featured  it flickers, its wearable, and its lightweight  the build couldnt be more simple. Its fancy through-hole LEDs and a coin cell holder, plus a tack pin to stick it through your shirt. But the final result is quite elegant thanks to clever use of PCB layering.\nThe first version was to get all the layers right to let the light through and embellish the jack-o-lanterns lines with manufacturer-applied silver solder, but as [Steph] points out, it looked like something a disturbed child might carve into their desk in detention. So [Steph] enlisted [Mx. Jack Nelson], who improved the artwork.\nPretty much every component does double duty here, including the tack pin  it serves as a switch because it can hold the battery in place. The batterys edges reflect the glowing light quite nicely around the edge of the pin. And the LEDs beneath the battery prevent it from slipping out. You can see how it goes together in the video after the break.\n\n\n \n\n", "title": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306aLED\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u3067LED\u306e\u304b\u307c\u3061\u3083\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3002\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002\u591a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3067\u5149\u308a\u8f1d\u304f\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306aLED\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u8a73\u7d30", "PCB\u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u3092\u5de7\u307f\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a8\u30ec\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u306aLED\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u69cb\u6210\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u8efd\u91cf\u306aLED\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8", "\u7279\u5fb4\u7684\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fLED\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306e\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u52d5\u753b"]}

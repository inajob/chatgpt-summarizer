Fortunately there is now a new game in town, with smart power banks, like the Anker one that [Aaron Christophel] recently purchased for reverse-engineering. It features Bluetooth (BLE), a smart app and a rather fancy screen on the front with quite a bit of information. This also means that theres a lot to hack here beyond basic battery management system (BMS) features.\nAs detailed on the GitHub project page, after you get past the glue-and-plastic-clip top, you will find inside a PCB with a GD32F303 MCU, a Telink TLSR8253 BLE IC and the 240240 ST7789 LCD in addition to a few other ICs to handle BMS functions, RTC and such. Before firmware version 1.6.2 you can simply overwrite the firmware, but Anker added a signature check to later firmware updates.\nThe BLE feature is used to communicate with the Anker app, which the official product page advertises as being good for real-time stats, smart charging and finding the power bank by making a loud noise. [Aaron] already reverse-engineered the protocol and offers his own alternative on the project page. Naturally updating the firmware is usually also done via BLE.\nAlthough the BLE and mobile app feature is decidedly a gimmick, hacking it could allow for some interesting UPS-like and other features. We just hope that battery safety features arent defined solely in software, lest these power banks can be compromised with a nefarious or improper firmware update.\n\n", "title": "- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u9006\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3001BLE\u3084\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u9023\u643a\u3067\u6539\u9020\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u304c\u61f8\u5ff5\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u9006\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u6311\u6226", "- Bluetooth\u642d\u8f09\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "- Anker\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3068BLE\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u66f4\u65b0\u306e\u88cf\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30ea\u30b9\u30af", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d0\u30f3\u30af\u6539\u9020\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

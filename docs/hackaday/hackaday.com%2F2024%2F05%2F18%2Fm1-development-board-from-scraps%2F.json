As they say, every lock has a key. [dosdude1] has wanted a specific M1 development board for a while now and has been slowly piecing together everything he needs to cobble one together, and finally got this unit running despite many roadblocks put in his way by Apple.\nThe development kit is a Developer Transition Kit\u00a0 or DTK meant for developers during Apples transition from Intel chips to their own in-house ARM-based M1 platform. This particular version is in a Mac Mini form factor but it has a few hurdles to clear before it powers on. First, the board was cut in a critical location that shorted out many of the PCB layers, so this had to be carefully filed down to remove the shorts. It was also missing a few tiny surface mount components and a NAND chip, but these were scavenged from other scrapped parts and assembled into a fully working machine. \nThere are a number of other non-physical problems to solve here as well, too. Apple coded their NAND chips to work with specific WiFi modules so if these arent programmed to work together the computer will get stuck in a boot loop. But with that and a few other details out of the way [dosdude1] finally has his DTK up and running in a 2018 Mac Mini chassis, right down to the working power LEDs. Weve seen all kinds of PCB damage before (although not often quite this intricate) and even PCBs repaired that were snapped in half.\nThanks to [CodeAsm] for the tip!\n\n", "title": "Apple\u306eM1\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff1a\u96e3\u984c\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u5411\u304b\u3046", "body": "Apple\u306f\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u6709\u540d\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u9069\u5207\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u5f7c\u3089\u306e\u969c\u58c1\u3092\u3044\u304f\u3089\u304b\u56de\u907f\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002[dosdude1]\u306f\u7279\u5b9a\u306eM1\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Apple\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u8a2d\u3051\u3089\u308c\u305f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u969c\u5bb3\u306b\u5411\u304d\u5408\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u3064\u3044\u306b\u3053\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u52d5\u4f5c\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Apple\u306eM1\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\uff1a\u96e3\u984c\u306b\u7acb\u3061\u5411\u304b\u3046", "Apple\u306eM1\u958b\u767a\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u518d\u751f\uff1a\u969c\u5bb3\u3068\u514b\u670d", "Apple\u306eM1\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059", "Apple\u306eM1\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u63a1\u7528\uff1a\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4f8b", "Apple\u306eM1\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306e\u6311\u6226"]}

This happened this week with Al Williams\u2019 Ask Hackaday: How Do You Make Front Panels?. I guess it\u2019s not so surprising that the comments were full of awesome answers \u2013 it was an \u201cAsk Hackaday\u201d after all. But you all delivered!\nA technique that I had never considered came up a few times: instead of engraving the front of an opaque panel, like one made of aluminum or something, instead if you\u2019re able to make the panel out of acrylic, you can paint the back side, laser or engrave into it, and then paint over with a contrast color. Very clever!\nSimply printing the panel out onto paper and laminating it got a number of votes, and for those who are 3D printing the enclosure anyway, simply embossing the letters into the surface had a number of fans. The trick here is in getting some contrast into the letters, and most suggested changing filament. All I know is that I\u2019ve tried to do it by painting the insides of the letters white, and it\u2019s too fiddly for me.\nBut my absolute favorite enclosure design technique got mentioned a number of times: cardboard-aided design. Certainly for simple or disposable projects, there\u2019s nothing faster than just cutting up some cardboard and taping it into the box of your desires. I\u2019ll often do this to get the sizes and locations of components right \u2013 it\u2019s only really a temporary solution. Although some folks have had success with treating the cardboard with a glue wash, paint, or simply wrapping it in packing tape to make it significantly more robust. Myself, if it ends up being a long-term project, I\u2019ll usually transfer the cardboard design to 3DP or cut out thin plywood.\nI got sidetracked here, though. What I really wanted to say was \u201cthanks!\u201d to everyone who submitted their awesome comments to Al\u2019s article. We\u2019ve had some truly hateful folks filling the comment section with trash lately, and I\u2019d almost given up hope. But then along comes an article like this and restores my faith.

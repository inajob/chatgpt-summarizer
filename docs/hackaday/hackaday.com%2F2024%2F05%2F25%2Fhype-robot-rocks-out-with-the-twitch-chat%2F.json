Youll want to meet [DJ Pfeif]s Flippin Rhobot, then. Hes a hype bot from the world of Twitch streaming, and he apparently knows how to party.\nFlippin Rhobot is controlled by an ESP32 that listens into the chat on [DJ Pfeif]s stream. Hes got a vaguely humanoid form, and he can rotate on the spot and wave his arms in the air courtesy of a few servos. Hes also got a little computer terminal that displays the shows Hack the Planet logo when he turns to face the screen. His body also features some addressable LEDs that flash and dance on command.\n[DJ Pfeif] does a good job of explaining the project, and includes the code that laces everything together. Interfacing with Twitch chat can be fun, and weve featured a guide on doing just that before, too.\nIf youre building your own roboticized hype machine, dont hesitate to let us know. Otherwise, consider musing on the very idea of humanoid robots as a whole!"}

Its arguably true of pretty much any electronic device given the way technology changes over time, though whether or not its objectively a bad thing is going to vary from case to case.\nAs a practical example, take a look at the insides of this 80s vintage HP 3314A function generator shared on the EEV Blog Forum by [D Straney].\nHinged PCBs allow for easy access\nWith multiple PCBs stacked on top of each other, its hard to imagine that more components could possibly be crammed into it. One board in particular appears to be an entire Motorola 6800 computer, something which today would likely be replaced with a single microcontroller.\nWhich is actually why [D Straney] shared this with us in the first place. After seeing our recent post about a modern waveform generator thats basically an empty box thanks to its modern components, they thought this would be a nice example of the opposite extreme.\nSo, is it a good or a bad thing that test equipment isnt made this way anymore? Well, its hard to argue with the improved capabilities, smaller footprint, and reduced cost of most modern gear. But damn is the inside of this HP 3314A gorgeous. As one of the commenters on the page put it, hardware from this era was really a work of art.", "title": "80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP 3314A\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "body": "\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u304c\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u3067\u300180\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP 3314A\u6a5f\u80fd\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u306f\u7f8e\u3057\u304f\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u3001\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6614\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u82b8\u8853\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eHP 3314A\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306880\u5e74\u4ee3\u88fdHP\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u6a5f\u5668\u3068\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u305f80\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "EEV\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e9\u30e0\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3055\u308c\u305fHP 3314A\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3068\u5f80\u5e74\u306e\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\uff1aHP 3314A\u306e\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7"]}

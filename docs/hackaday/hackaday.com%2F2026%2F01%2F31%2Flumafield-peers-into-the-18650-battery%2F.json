The cheaper brands were found to have higher levels of manufacturing defects which can lead them to being unsafe. All the nitty-gritty details are available in the report, which can be downloaded for free from Lumafield, as well as the Tested video they did with [Adam] below.\nActually weve been talking here at Hackaday over at our virtual water-cooler (okay, okay, our Discord server) about how to store lithium-ion batteries and we learned about this cool bit of kit: the BAT-SAFE. Maybe check that out if youre stickler for safety like us! (Thanks Maya Posch!)\nWe have of course heard from [Adam Savage] before, check out [Adam Savage] Giving A Speech About The Maker Movement and [Adam Savage]s First Order Of Retrievability Tool Boxes.\n\n", "title": "- \u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "body": "Lumafield\u304c18650\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u96fb\u6c60\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u5831\u544a\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u96fb\u6c60\u306f\u88fd\u9020\u6b20\u9665\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u306b\u554f\u984c\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b89\u5168\u306a\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u306a18650\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u5371\u967a\uff01\u88fd\u9020\u4e0d\u826f\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "- Lumafield\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u54c1\u8cea\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u5fb9\u5e95\u5206\u6790", "- BAT-SAFE\u3067\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u4fdd\u7ba1", "- Adam Savage\u3068\u5b66\u3076\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027"]}

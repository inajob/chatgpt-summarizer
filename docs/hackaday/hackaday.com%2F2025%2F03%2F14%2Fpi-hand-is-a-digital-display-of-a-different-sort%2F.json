Whether its something they personally did or some other persons project they want to bring to our attention, a lot of folks out there are very excited about numbers today.\nOne of our most prolific circumference aficionados is [Cristiano Monteiro], who, for the last several years, has put together a special project to commemorate the date. For 2025, hes come up with a robotic hand that will use its fingers to show the digits of Pi one at a time. Since theres only one hand, anything higher than five will be displayed as two gestures in quick succession, necessitating a bit of addition on the viewers part.\n[Cristiano] makes no claims about the anatomical accuracy of his creation. Indeed, if your mitts look anything like this, you should seek medical attention immediately. But whether you think of them as fingers or nightmarish claws, its the motion of the individual digits that matter.\nTo that end, each one is attached to an MG90 servo, which an Arduino Nano drives with attached Servo Shield. From there, its just a matter of code to get the digits wiggling out the correct value, which [Cristiano] has kindly shared for anyone looking to recreate this project.\nIf youre hungry for more Pi, the ghostly display that [Cristiano] sent in last year is definitely worth another look. While not directly related to todays mathematical festivities, the portable GPS time server he put together back in 2021 is another fantastic build you should check out.\n\n"}

That is, until [Kevin Noki] came across it in an Apple design book and contacted [Hartmut] to ask whether he would be okay with providing detailed measurements so that he could create his own.\nInside the 3D printed enclosure is a Raspberry Pi 4 running an appropriately emulated Macintosh, with a few modern features on the I/O side, including HDMI and USB. Ironically, the screen is from a 3rd generation iPad, which [Kevin] bought broken on EBay. Theres also an internal floppy drive thats had its eject mechanism cleverly motorized, along with a modified USB battery bank that should keep the whole show running for about an hour. The enclosure itself is carefully glued, painted and sculpted to make it look as close to the original design as possible, which includes custom keycaps for the mechanical switches.\nAs far as DIY projects go, this one is definitely not for the faint of heart, but its fascinating to contrast this kind of project thats possible for any determined hobbyist with the effort it would have taken forty years ago. The only question thats left is whether or not the FlatMac would have actually been a practical system if it had made it to production. Although the keyboard seems decent, the ergonomics feel somewhat questionable compared to something more laptop-like.\n\n\nThanks to [Daniel Doran] for the tip.", "title": "\u300cApple FlatMac\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eApple\u306eFlatMac\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u30923D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u518d\u73fe\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cApple FlatMac\uff1a1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u305fDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff1aFlatMac\u306e\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u5236\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Hartmut Esslinger\u306eFlatMac\u518d\u73fe\u300d", "\u300c\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u6e80\u8f09\u306eFlatMac\uff1aiPad\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u300d", "\u300cDIY\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01FlatMac\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3068\u9b45\u529b\u300d"]}

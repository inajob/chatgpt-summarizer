Unfortunately this leads to keyboard confusion between the two when one is connected to an external display.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this, [der-b] designed a keyboard that can be connected to more than one device at a time, despite ultimately thinking that this will lead to another layer of confusion. The point was to try to make something as lightweight as possible, since carrying two laptops is already a struggle. As a bonus, this project was a learning experience for soldering SMD parts.\nThe keyboard itself is based on the Planck and uses an ATMega32u4 running QMK firmware, so that means its a 40% ortholinear with 48 keys total. [der-b] used low-profile Cherry MX switches to keep things sleek.\nIn order to switch between different host devices, [der-b] uses shortcuts as youll see in the short video after the break. This is accomplished with a FSUSB36 IC on the USB connections between the ATMega and the host.\n[der-b] encountered a spate of issues while building this keyboard, which you can read all about in the blog post. We love to see transparency when it comes to your write-ups, especially when the projects become learning experiences. (Arent they all?) But if 48 keys arent nearly enough for you, check out this learning-experience keyboard build.\n\n", "title": "40%\u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "body": "Linux\u958b\u767a\u8005\u306e[der-b]\u304c\u30012\u53f0\u306e\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC\u3092\u6301\u3061\u6b69\u304b\u3056\u308b\u3092\u5f97\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308a\u3001\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6df7\u4e71\u3092\u89e3\u6d88\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u8907\u6570\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u30aa\u30eb\u30bd\u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u3042\u308bPlanck\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3001SMD\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u306f\u3093\u3060\u4ed8\u3051\u306a\u3069\u3082\u5b66\u3073\u306a\u304c\u3089\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3002", "titles": ["40%\u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u8efd\u91cf\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u591a\u6a5f\u7a2e\u63a5\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "QMK\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5236\u4f5c", "Cherry MX\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8584\u578b\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u5236\u4f5c"]}

Unfortunately this leads to keyboard confusion between the two when one is connected to an external display.\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this, [der-b] designed a keyboard that can be connected to more than one device at a time, despite ultimately thinking that this will lead to another layer of confusion. The point was to try to make something as lightweight as possible, since carrying two laptops is already a struggle. As a bonus, this project was a learning experience for soldering SMD parts.\nThe keyboard itself is based on the Planck and uses an ATMega32u4 running QMK firmware, so that means its a 40% ortholinear with 48 keys total. [der-b] used low-profile Cherry MX switches to keep things sleek.\nIn order to switch between different host devices, [der-b] uses shortcuts as youll see in the short video after the break. This is accomplished with a FSUSB36 IC on the USB connections between the ATMega and the host.\n[der-b] encountered a spate of issues while building this keyboard, which you can read all about in the blog post. We love to see transparency when it comes to your write-ups, especially when the projects become learning experiences. (Arent they all?) But if 48 keys arent nearly enough for you, check out this learning-experience keyboard build.\n\n"}

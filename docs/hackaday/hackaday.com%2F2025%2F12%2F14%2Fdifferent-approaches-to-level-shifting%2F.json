Another wants 5V. What do you do? Over on the [Playduino] YouTube channel, theres a recent video running us through a not-so-recent concern: various approaches to level-shifting.\nIn the video, the specific voltage domains of 3.3 volts and 5 volts are given, but you can apply the same principles to other voltage domains, such as 1.8 volts, 2.5 volts, or nearly any two levels. Various approaches are discussed depending on whether you are interfacing 5 V to 3.3 V or 3.3 V to 5 V.\n\nThe first way to convert 5 V into 3.3 V is to use a voltage divider, made from two resistors. This is a balancing act: if the resistors are too small, the circuit wastes power; if they are too large, they inhibit fast signals.\nThe second approach to converting 5 V into 3.3 V is to use a bare resistor of at least 10K. This is a controversial approach, but it may work in your situation. The trick is to rely on the voltage drop across the series resistor to either drop enough voltage or limit the current flowing through input protection diodes, which will clamp the voltage but also burn out with too much current flow.\nThe third approach to converting 5 V into 3.3 V is to use chips from the 74AHC series or 74LVC series, such as inverting or non-inverting buffers. These chips can do the level shifting for you.\nThe easiest approach for going in the other direction is to simply connect them directly and hope you get lucky! Needless to say, this approach is fraught with peril.\nThe second approach for converting 3.3 V into 5 V is to make your own inverting or non-inverting buffer using, in this case, an N-channel Enhancement-mode MOSFET. Use one MOSFET for an inverting buffer and two MOSFETs for a non-inverting buffer. Just make sure you pick N-MOSFETs with 3.3 V or 5 V gate drive voltage VGS.\u00a0Alternatively, you can use a buffer from the 74HCT series.\nThe video provides a myriad of approaches to level shifting, but you still have to decide. Do you have a favorite approach that wasnt listed? Have you had good or bad luck with any of the approaches? Let us know in the comments!

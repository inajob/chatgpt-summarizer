Theyre reliable, simple, and rugged  but there are some disadvantages. Its difficult to control the speed without complex electronics, and precisely placing the shaft at a given angle is next to impossible. But the core of these common induction machines can be modified and rewired into brushless DC (BLDC) motors, provided you have a few tools on hand as [Austin] demonstrates.\nTo convert an AC induction motor to a brushless DC electric motor (BLDC), the stator needs to be completely rewired. It also needs a number of poles proportional to the number of phases of the BLDC controller, and in this case the 24-pole motor could accommodate the three phases. [Austin] removed the original stator windings and hand-wound his own in a 16-pole configuration. The rotor needs modification as well, so he turned the rotor on a lathe and then added a set of permanent magnets secured to the rotor with JB Weld. From there it just needs some hall effect sensors, a motor controller and power to get spinning.\nAt this point the motor could be used for anything a BLDC motor would be used. For this project, [Austin] is putting it on a bicycle. A 3D printed pulley mounts to the fixed gear on the rear wheel, and a motor controller, battery, and some tensioners are all that is left to get this bike under power. His tests show it comfortably drawing around 1.3 kW so you may want to limit this if youre in Europe but other than that it works extremely well and reminds us of one of our favorite ebike conversions based on a washing machine motor instead of a drill press.\n\n", "title": "- AC\u8a98\u5c0e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "AC\u8a98\u5c0e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- AC\u8a98\u5c0e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u5909\u63db\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u96fb\u52d5\u5316", "- \u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u6539\u9020\uff1aAC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u518d\u914d\u7dda\u624b\u9806", "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9DC\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u306e\u6c38\u4e45\u78c1\u77f3\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u653b\u7565\u6cd5", "- \u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u96fb\u52d5\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6210\u529f\u4e8b\u4f8b\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c"]}

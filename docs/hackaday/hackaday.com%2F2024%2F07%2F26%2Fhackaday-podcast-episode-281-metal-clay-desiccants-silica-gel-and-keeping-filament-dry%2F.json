First up in the news: our fresh new contest has drawn three entries already! Thats right, the 2024 Tiny Games Challenge is underway. You have until September 10th to show us your best tiny game, whether that means tiny hardware, tiny code, or a tiny BOM.\nThen its on to Whats That Sound, which sounded familiar to Kristina, but she couldnt place it. Can you get it? Can you figure it out? Can you guess whats making that sound? If you can, and your number comes up, you get a special Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nThen its on to the hacks, beginning with a hack to print metal and a way to weld wood, along with a photo-resistor-based, single-pixel camera. Well talk desiccants carbon fiber, and Baron Harkonnen. Finally, we discuss the troubles of keeping hygroscopic materials from degrading, and have a klatch about Keebin with Kristina.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 281 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nShow Us Your Minimalist Games, And Win\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nFill out this form with your best guess, and you might win!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nCeraMetal Lets You Print Metal, Cheaply And Easily\n\nNot Acceptable!\nHome\n\n\nMechanical Keyboard + Laptop = Clacktop\nSealed Packs Of Pok\u00e9mon Cards Give Up Their Secrets Without Opening Them\n\n2000-Year Old Charred Manuscripts Reveal Their Secrets\nVesuvius Challenge 2023 Grand Prize Awarded And 2024\u2019s New Challenge\n\n\nWelding Wood Is As Simple As Rubbing Two Sticks Together\n\nThis Laser-Cut One-Piece Wedge Tenon Locks Wood Joints Tight\n\n\nPhotoresistor-based Single Pixel Camera\n\nA Single Pixel Digital Camera With Arduino\nA Very Modern Flying Spot Scanner\nYou Can Use LEDs As Sensors, Too\n\n\nDesiccants, Tested Side By Side\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nExploring Cheap Tantalum Caps Of Mysterious Provenance\nAsk Hackaday: Should We Teach BASIC?\nCould Carbon Fiber Be The New Asbestos?\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\nRobot Seeks And Sucks Up Cigarette Butts, With Its Feet\nA Throne For LEGO Baron Harkonnen\n2024 Tiny Games Challenge: Improving Reaction Time\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nFDM Filament Troubles: Keeping Hygroscopic Materials From Degrading\nKeebin\u2019 With Kristina: The One With The Key Cap Map\n", "title": "2024 Tiny Games Challenge: \u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u8a18\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u300c2024 Tiny Games Challenge\u300d\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3067\u3001\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u306f9\u670810\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u306b\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u63d0\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u306e\u5370\u5237\u3084\u6728\u306e\u6eb6\u63a5\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8b70\u8ad6\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["2024 Tiny Games Challenge: \u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01", "\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8PC\u3092\u7d50\u3076\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306f\uff1f", "\u6728\u3092\u6eb6\u63a5\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30fb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u6e7f\u6c17\u3092\u9632\u3050\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30b7\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c"]}

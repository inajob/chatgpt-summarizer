[2dom] started with the T3\u2019s circular pattern of holes and experimented with several variations, finally settling on a cylindrical shape with a central display; a prototype with a low-power monochrome rectangular display was eventually rejected in favor of a circular LCD. The housing consists of four 3D-printed components: an upper and lower shell, a resonator for the speaker, and a knob for a rotary encoder.Electronics-wise, an ESP32 handles the computing requirements, while the LCD and rotary encoder provide a user interface. For audio, it uses a VS1053 MP3 decoder, PAM8403 amplifier, and a wideband speaker, with an audio isolation transformer to clean up the audio. To reduce power consumption, a MOSFET cuts power to the peripheral components whenever the device is in sleep mode. The full design is available on GitHub.The end result of this effort is a quite authentic-looking 21st-century adaptation of Rams\u2019s original designs. If you\u2019re interested in more Braun designs, check out this replica of one of their desk fans. We\u2019ve also seen a restoration of one of Braun\u2019s larger radios, the TS2.\n", "title": "\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30e0\u30b9\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u4e3b\u7fa9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "body": "\u30c0\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30e0\u30b9\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u4e3b\u7fa9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u5f71\u97ff\u3057\u305fIR7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u6982\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30e0\u30b9\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u4e3b\u7fa9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa", "ESP32\u3068LCD\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u97f3\u97ff\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f21\u4e16\u7d00\u306e\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7", "GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u30d5\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u89e3\u8aac"]}

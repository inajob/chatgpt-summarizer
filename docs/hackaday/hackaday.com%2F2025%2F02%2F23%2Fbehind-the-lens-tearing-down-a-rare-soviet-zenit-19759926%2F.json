Found broken on eBay (for a steal!), this 1982 made-in-USSR single-lens reflex camera isnt the average Zenit. It features, for example, electronically controlled shutter timing  quite the upgrade from its manual siblings.\nThe not-so-minor issue that made this Zenit 19 come for cheap was a missing shutter blade. Youd say  one blade gone rogue! Is it lost in the cameras guts, or snapped clean off? Add to that some oxidized battery contacts and a cracked viewfinder, and youve got proper fixer-upper material. But thats where it gets intriguing: the camera houses a rare hybrid electronic module (PAPO 074), complete with epoxy-covered resistors. The shutter speed dial directly adjusts a set of resistors, sending precise signals to the shutter assembly: a neat blend of old-school mechanics and early electronics.\nNow will it shutter, or stutter? With its vertical metal shutter  uncommon in Zenits  and separate light metering circuitry, this teardown offers a rare glimpse into Soviet engineering flair. Hungry for more? Weve covered a Soviet-era computer and a radio in the past. If youre more into analog camera teardowns, you might like this analog Pi upgrade attempt, or this bare minimum analog camera project.\n\n", "title": "- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u88fd\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\uff1a\u73cd\u3057\u3044Zenit 19\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "body": "\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u88fd\u306e\u73cd\u3057\u3044Zenit 19\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u96fb\u5b50\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u3084\u5e0c\u5c11\u306a\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u96fb\u5b50\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u88fd\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\uff1a\u73cd\u3057\u3044Zenit 19\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\uff1a\u96fb\u5b50\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- Zenit 19\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u6b20\u3051\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u884c\u65b9", "- \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u518d\u767a\u898b\uff1a\u4fee\u7406\u30fb\u6539\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

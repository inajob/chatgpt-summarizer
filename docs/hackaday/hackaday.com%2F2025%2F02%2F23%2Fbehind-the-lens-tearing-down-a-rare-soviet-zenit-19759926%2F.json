Found broken on eBay (for a steal!), this 1982 made-in-USSR single-lens reflex camera isnt the average Zenit. It features, for example, electronically controlled shutter timing  quite the upgrade from its manual siblings.\nThe not-so-minor issue that made this Zenit 19 come for cheap was a missing shutter blade. Youd say  one blade gone rogue! Is it lost in the cameras guts, or snapped clean off? Add to that some oxidized battery contacts and a cracked viewfinder, and youve got proper fixer-upper material. But thats where it gets intriguing: the camera houses a rare hybrid electronic module (PAPO 074), complete with epoxy-covered resistors. The shutter speed dial directly adjusts a set of resistors, sending precise signals to the shutter assembly: a neat blend of old-school mechanics and early electronics.\nNow will it shutter, or stutter? With its vertical metal shutter  uncommon in Zenits  and separate light metering circuitry, this teardown offers a rare glimpse into Soviet engineering flair. Hungry for more? Weve covered a Soviet-era computer and a radio in the past. If youre more into analog camera teardowns, you might like this analog Pi upgrade attempt, or this bare minimum analog camera project.\n\n"}

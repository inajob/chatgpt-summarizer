Sometimes, theres just this missing piece in the puzzle that requires you to do a small hack, and those are the most tempting. [maxime borges] has such a perfect setup that involves a HDMI 4:2 switch, and he brings us a write-up on integrating that HDMI switch into Home Assistant through emulating an infrared receivers signals.\n\nThe HDMI switch is equipped with an infrared sensor as the only means of controlling it, so naturally, that was the path chosen for interfacing the ESP32 put inside the switch. Fortunately, Home Assistant provides the means to both receive and output IR signals, so after capturing all the codes produced by the IR remote, parsing their meaning, then turning them into a Home Assistant configuration, [maxime] got HDMI input switching to happen from the comfort of his phone.\nWe get the Home Assistant config snippets right there in the blog post  if youve been looking for a HDMI switch for your hacker lair, now you have one model to look out for in particular. Of course, you could roll your own HDMI switch, and if youre looking for references, weve covered a good few hacks doing that as part of building a KVM.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5cHDMI\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092Home Assistant\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30dc\u7528\u306e\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u611f\u899a\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f HDMI 4:2\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u8fbc\u3093\u3060(maxime borges)\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002IR\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u5236\u5fa1\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002 Home Assistant\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066HDMI\u5165\u529b\u5207\u66ff\u3092\u884c\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5cHDMI\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092Home Assistant\u306b\u7d71\u5408\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "IR\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066HDMI\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30e9\u30dc\u3067\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u306eHDMI\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u7d39\u4ecb", "ESP32\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066HDMI\u5165\u529b\u306e\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u3092\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "KVM\u69cb\u7bc9\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u81ea\u4f5cHDMI\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af"]}

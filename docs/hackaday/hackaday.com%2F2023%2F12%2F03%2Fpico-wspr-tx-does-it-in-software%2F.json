There are builds that work with just a couple of transistors. But how about a GPS-disciplined small signal beacon? You can actually get the job done for less than the cost of a fancy hamburger, thanks to [RPiks]\u2019s pico-WSPR-tx and the Weak Signal Propagation Reporter Network (WSPR).\nWSPR is a digital protocol where a beacon encodes its callsign, location, and transmitting power, and then sends it out to a network of receiving stations worldwide. The idea is to use the data coming from the beacons to determine whether radio propagation conditions are good or not; if you hear a quiet signal from afar, they\u2019re good in that direction. [RPiks]\u2019s beacon design simply includes a Raspberry Pi Pico and a GPS receiver. Everything else is software.\nOf course, this means that it\u2019s using the Pico\u2019s GPIO pins for transmission. Maybe you want to add some filtering to take off the rough square-wave edges, and/or maybe you want to boost the power a little bit with an external amplifier. If so, check out our own $50 Ham column\u2019s advice on the topic. But you don\u2019t need to. Just a Pico and a GPS should get you working, if you want to test the WSPR waters."}

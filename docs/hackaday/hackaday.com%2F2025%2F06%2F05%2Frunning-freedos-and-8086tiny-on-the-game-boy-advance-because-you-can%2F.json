Inside an 8086 emulator. If youre like [ZZAZZ] and similarly suffer intrusive project-related thoughts, then this might be a moment of clear recognition, somewhat like sharing ones story at a Programmers Anonymous meeting, but we digress.\n\nIn the video, the basic premise of making even the 8086tiny emulator work on the GBA seemed improbable on the outset  courtesy of the rather limited memory environment provided by the GBA  before even daring to look at things like disk access.\nHowever, letting silly things like segmented memory and mismatched memory addresses deter us from pleasing said intrusive thoughts would be beyond the pale. Ergo we get a shining example of how days of rewriting code, stripping code, debugging code, fixing alignment issues in code and writing work-arounds for newly discovered issues in code can ultimately lead to the proud moment where FreeDOS boots on the GBA.\nGranted it takes over an hour to do so, and has to be started from a butchered Pok\u00e9mon Emerald save file, courtesy of a well-known exploit in that game, thankfully preserved in counterfeit cartridges.\nAdmittedly were not sure what practical applications there are for FreeDOS on the GBA, but thats never stopped hackers from taking on impossible projects before, so theres no sense letting it get in the way now.\n\n\nThanks to [Jinxy] for the tip.", "title": "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u3067FreeDOS\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "body": "GBA\u3067FreeDOS\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u6311\u6226\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u3067FreeDOS\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u6311\u6226", "\u9650\u754c\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\uff01GBA\u306b8086\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u307e\u3067", "\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6d17\u7df4\uff1aGBA\u3067FreeDOS\u3092\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u904e\u7a0b", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30a8\u30e1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u306e\u5947\u8de1\u7684\u306aGBA\u30cf\u30c3\u30af", "\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\uff1aGBA\u306e\u81ea\u7531\u306aOS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

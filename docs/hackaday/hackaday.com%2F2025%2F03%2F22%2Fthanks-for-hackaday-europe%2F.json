It was great to be surrounded by so many crazy, bright, and crazy-bright folks all sharing what they are pouring their creative energy into. The talks were great, and the discussions and impromptu collaborations have added dramatically to our stack of to-do projects. (Thanks?) Badges were hacked, stories were shared, and a good time was had by all.\nAt the event, we were approached by someone who wanted to know if we could replicate something like Hackaday Europe in a different location, one where there just isn\u2019t as vibrant a hacking scene. And the answer, of course, was maybe, but probably not.\nIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t try to put on a good show, bring along fun schwag, and schedule up a nice location. But it\u2019s the crowd of people who attend who make a Hackaday event a Hackaday event. Without you all, it just wouldn\u2019t work.\nSo in that spirit, thanks to everyone who attended, and who brought along their passions and projects! It was great to see you all, and we\u2019ll do it again soon.\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

But the BBC reports  unsurprisingly  that the mag stripes days are numbered. Between smartphones, QR codes, and RFID, theres just less demand for the venerable technology.\nIBM invented the stripe back in the early 1960s. The engineer responsible, [Forrest Parry], was also involved in developing the UPC code. While working on a secure ID for the CIA, his wife suggested using an iron to melt a strip of magnetic tape onto the card. The rest is history.\n\nThe new technology rapidly took over, and by 1969, in the United States, there was a standard that has remained largely unchanged. The BBC post notes that a card reader in 1970 could read a credit card out of your pocket today if it still had a magnetic stripe. Infamously, IBMs CEO at the time was not a fan, reportedly because Mom doesnt like credit cards.\nSo, while youll still find mag stripes on a few cards here and there, in a few years, theyll probably vanish completely. Dont worry! You can still make your own. Dont have a reader? Grab a flatbed scanner.", "title": "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u8870\u9000", "body": "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u306f\u9577\u5e74\u3001\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3001ID\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8\u306a\u3069\u3067\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304c\u3001BBC\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3001QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3001RFID\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u65e5\u3005\u306fnumbered\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002IBM\u304c1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u982d\u306b\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306f\u6d88\u3048\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u6280\u8853\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u8870\u9000", "IBM\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u304c\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u767a\u660e", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3084QR\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048", "\u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u6280\u8853\u304c\u7d42\u7109\u3078", "DIY: \u78c1\u6c17\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c"]}

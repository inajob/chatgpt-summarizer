As hard as it is to believe, a whole year has gone by, and were now just a few days away from kicking off our annual hardware hacking extravaganza in Pasadena. Tickets just sold out over the weekend  thank you procrastinators!\nFor those of you who have tickets to join us this weekend, weve got a few last minute announcements and bits of information we wanted to get out to you. As a reminder, you can find the full schedule for all three days on the official Supercon site.\n\nNew Events Added!\nFor those whove attended a Supercon before, you know we like to cram as much content as we can into the weekend. But theres always room for more, and this year weve managed to squeeze in a couple extra activities that were very excited about.\nHalloween Hacker Happy Hour\nIt just so happens that Halloween is the night before Supercon officially kicks off, and that seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up. So well be throwing a pre-event party at the nearby KingsRow Gastropub where costumes and all manner of blinking LEDs are very much encouraged. Officially well be hanging out from 7:00 to 10:00 PM, but dont be surprised if you find yourself still talking to Hackaday folks at last call.\n\nYou dont need tickets for this event, but wed like to have a rough head count, so if you could RSVP through Eventbrite wed appreciate it.\nTinas Junk Challenge\nTinas been piling up her treasures for weeks\nWeve always wanted to introduce some kind of swap meet aspect to Supercon, but the logistics have always been a challenge. This year though, were finally going to get the chance to test out the idea. Former DesignLab Resident Tina Belmont is in the process of moving out of the country and needs to find a new home for her electronic bric-a-brac.\nEverything is free, so attendees are encouraged to take anything they think they can make use of. Naturally, an influx of interesting hardware could provide for some very unique badge hacking possibilities. If we can get enough people to graft these second-hand components onto their badges, we just might be able to turn it into a proper category come Sunday night.\nA table where folks can offload their electronic bits and bobs has worked well at other hacker cons, so were eager to see how it goes at Supercon. If this is something youd like to see more of, or would potentially like to participate in next year, let us know.\nKruxs Side Quests\nLets be honest, most of us are already taking our marching orders from the computer in one way or another. So why not turn it into a fun interactive game?\n\nThe idea is simple: use the mysterious retrocomputer oracle, and it gives you a quest. Maybe youll have to find a hidden item, or solve a riddle. Krux has a run a variation of this game at Toor Con in the past, but the challenges spit out by the computer this time will be tailored to Supercon.\nWindows Through Wires Exhibition\nYou may recall that we asked the Hackaday community if they had any unusual display technology theyd like to show off during Supercon as part of an exhibit.\n\nWell, as you might have imagined, the response was incredible. From gorgeous vintage pieces to completely custom hardware, theres going to be a wide array of fascinating hardware for attendees to study up-close.\nWhile getting a chance to see various display technologies throughout the years would have our attention as it is, whats really exciting is that many of the custom-built devices in the exhibit are either projects hosted on Hackaday.io or ones that weve covered at some point on the front page.\nConsidering how gorgeous some of them have looked in photographs, were eager to drool over them in the real world  and we bet you are to.\nWorkshop Technical Difficulties\nHopefully weve provided enough good news that we can slip in a bit of the bad. Unfortunately, weve had to cancel the Hands on with an Electron Microscope workshop that was to be hosted by Adam McCombs and Isabel Burgos. Everyone with tickets will of course be getting a refund, and you should be receiving an email to that effect shortly if you havent already.\nWhile were just as disappointed by this news as you are, its one of those situations where there simply werent any good solutions. Long story short, the scanning electron microscope that was small enough to bring to Supercon is down, and theres just not enough time to get it up and running at this point. An attempt was made to find another small-ish electron microscope on short notice butwell, thats just as tricky to pull off as it sounds.\nSend Us Your Lightning Talks!\nTo end this update on a high note, we want to remind everyone that this year well once again be going Lighting Talks on Sunday morning. If youve never given a talk before, the shorter seven minute format is perfect for getting your feet wet. Or maybe youve got something you want to talk about that doesnt take a whole hour to explain. Either way, the Lightning Talks are a great way to share what your passionate about with the Supercon audience.\nIf youd like to give a Lightning Talk, simply fill out this form. You can upload slides if youve got them, but they arent strictly necessary."}

It has bee traditionally generated by analogue means, generating a double sideband and filtering away the unwanted side, or generating 90 degree phase shifted quadrature signals and mixing them. More recent software-defined radios have taken this into the CPU, but heres [Georg DG6RS] with another method. It uses SDR techniques and a combination of AM and FM to achieve polar modulation and generate SSB. Hes provided a fascinating in-depth technical explanation to help understand how it works.\nThe hardware is relatively straightforward; an SI5351 clock generator provides the reference for an ADF4351 PLL and VCO, which in turn feeds a PE4302 digital attenuator. Its all driven from an STM32F103 microcontroller which handles the signal processing. Internally this means conventionally creating I and Q streams from the incoming audio, then an algorithm to generate the phase and amplitude for polar modulation. These are fed to the PLL and attenuator in turn for FM and AM modulation, and the result is SSB. Its only suitable for narrow bandwidths, but its a novel and surprisingly simple deign.\nWe like being presented with new (to us at least) techniques, as it never pays to stand still. Meanwhile for more conventional designs, weve got you covered.", "title": "- \u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067SSB\uff08\u5358\u5074\u5305\uff09\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b", "body": "SSB\u306e\u751f\u6210\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305fSDR\u6280\u8853\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- \u697d\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067SSB\uff08\u5358\u5074\u5305\uff09\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b", "- \u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u5b9a\u7fa9\u7121\u7dda (SDR) \u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u306eSSB\u6280\u8853", "- STM32\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aSSB\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "- AM\u3068FM\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6975\u6027\u5909\u8abf\u306e\u6280\u8853\u89e3\u8aac", "- \u72ed\u5e2f\u57df\u5411\u3051\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044SSB\u751f\u6210\u624b\u6cd5\u3068\u305d\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

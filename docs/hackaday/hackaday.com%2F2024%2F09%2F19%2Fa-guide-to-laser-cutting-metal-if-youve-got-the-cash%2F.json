True, some hobby lasers now offer IR laser heads with modest power to engrave metal. The xTool S1, for example, accepts a 2 W IR laser as an option, but we doubt it would cut through anything thicker than foil. However, there are a growing number of fiber and carbon dioxide lasers that can cut metal at semi-reasonable prices, and [All3DP] has a primer on the technology that is worth a read.\nAccording to the post, CO2 lasers are less expensive but require gas assist, cant work with shiny metals well, and are finicky because of the mirrors and glass tube inside. Fiber lasers cost more, but dont need gas, work on more materials, and have fewer parts that need maintenance or may be prone to damage. There are other kinds of lasers, but the post focuses on these, the most common ones.\nMachines that can cut metal arent cheap. They start at about $10,000. However, prices are dropping and we remember when $10,000 would buy you what would today be a terrible oscilloscope, so maybe theres hope for an impulse-buy metal-cutting laser one day.\nIt isnt that diode lasers cant cut metal at all, but the results are not terribly useful. What would you rather have? A metal cutter or a metal 3D printer?", "title": "\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u3092\u5207\u524a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "body": "\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u5207\u308c\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306f\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3002CO2\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u5b89\u3044\u304c\u30ac\u30b9\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u5149\u6ca2\u306e\u3042\u308b\u91d1\u5c5e\u306b\u306f\u9069\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30ac\u30b9\u4e0d\u8981\u3067\u591a\u6750\u6599\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f$10,000\u304b\u3089\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u3092\u5207\u524a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u3068\u7279\u5fb4", "\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068CO2\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\uff1a\u91d1\u5c5e\u5207\u524a\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u9055\u3044", "\u91d1\u5c5e\u5207\u65ad\u7528\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u4fa1\u683c\u3068\u5c06\u6765\u6027", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u3092\u5207\u524a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9", "\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u3069\u3061\u3089\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u304b"]}

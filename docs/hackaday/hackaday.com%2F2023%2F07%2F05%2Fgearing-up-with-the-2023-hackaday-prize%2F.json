You\u2019re working on a project, and you need to do some ultra-precise probing, so you end up making a custom PCB probing octopus along the way. Or you find that you spend more time making the jig to hold down a part for machining than you do machining it. Hackers are not merely a tool-using species, we\u2019re a tool-making species \u2013 it\u2019s in our nature to want to build the tools that make it easier to get the job done.\nThe Gearing Up round of the Hackaday Prize celebrates the tool makers. If you\u2019ve got a project that maybe isn\u2019t an end in itself, but rather one of those utility project that can make all the difference, we want to see it here. Maybe it\u2019s obscure measurement gear, maybe it\u2019s a test rig or a bolt sorter, maybe you\u2019ve built your own reflow hot plate. This is the challenge round for you!\nThe Gearing Up round runs from yesterday, July 4th, until August 8th. As with all of the 2023 Hackaday Prize rounds, ten finalists will receive $500 and get entered for the big prizes to be announced in November.\nInspiration\nA benchtop power supply is an absolutely classic gear project. Whether you choose to go all-out like [The Big One]\u2019s Bench Power Supply or choose to go minimal like [John Loeffler]\u2019s Open Power, we love to see what powers your projects. Another classic is the DIY soldering iron, like [vlk]\u2019s OLED RT Soldering Pen or [Thomas Leputsch]\u2019s USB-PD version.\nOr how about building your own microscope? [Braun\u2019s CNC] has a nice monocular Pi scope based on the camera module v 1.3 and the [FabLab M\u00fcnchen] doubles down with the Stereo Ninja, which couples two cameras with innovative display options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you need to build your own tools because nobody else out there is going to do it for you. That was certainly the case with [Colin O\u2019Flynn]\u2019s 2nd-place winning entry into the first-ever Hackaday Prize, the Chip Whisperer. Nobody else was making an affordable chip glitcher. Or take [Ji\u0159\u00ed Praus]\u2019s lovely Precise Wire Bending Machine that he uses to make exquisite freeform circuit sculptures. We\u2019re not sure which is the real piece of art. And from way out in left field, we still love [michimartini]\u2019s Masking Tape Plotter. It\u2019s a tool that fills a need we didn\u2019t even know we had!\nAnd don\u2019t forget software! When developing embedded firmware, nothing comes in handy as often as a nice serial port plotter, and [Hasan Yavuz \u00d6zderya]\u2019s is a great one. Any time I need a quick laser or CNC-cut box, I reach for [Florian Festi]\u2019s box designer, Boxes.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get the idea, right? If it\u2019s a project that helps you make other projects, it\u2019s a tool project, and it\u2019s a great fit for the Gearing Up Challenge. All that remains for you to do is write it up on Hackaday.io, check out the contest rules, and enter it into the Hackaday Prize. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019re up to!\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "DIY\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u305f\u3061\u306f\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u4f5c\u308a\u3082\u5f97\u610f\u3067\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3002\u6280\u8853\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30927\u67084\u65e5\u304b\u30898\u67088\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u52df\u96c6\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3084\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u5fdc\u52df\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3002\u5927\u7269\u3082\u5c0f\u7269\u3082OK\u3002\u9078\u3070\u308c\u305f10\u4eba\u306f$500\u3092\u53d7\u8cde\u3002\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u3082\u7d39\u4ecb\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["DIY\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30b7\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30d9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u5207\u65ad\u7bb1\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

He suggests a focus shift from software, to data.\nThe internet as we know it and all the services it runs are built on FOSS architecture and infrastructure. None of the big tech companies would be where they are without FOSS, and certainly none could do without it. But FOSS has its share of what can be thought of as loopholes, and in the years during which the internet has exploded in growth and use, large tech companies have found and exploited all of them. A product doesnt need to disclose a single line of source code if its never actually distributed. And Red Hat (which [Perens] asserts is really just IBM) have simply stopped releasing public distributions of CentOS.\nIn addition, the inherent weak points of FOSS remain largely the same. These include funding distributions, lack of user-focused design, and the fact that users frankly dont understand what FOSS offers them, why its important, or even that it exists at all.\nA change is needed, and its suggested that the time has come to move away from a focus on software, and shift that focus instead to data. Expand the inherent transparency of FOSS to ensure that people have control and visibility of their own data.\nWhile the ideals of FOSS remain relevant, this isnt the first time the changing tech landscape has raised questions about how things are done, like the intersection of bug bounties and FOSS.\nWhat do you think?

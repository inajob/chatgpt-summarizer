Today, its pretty routinely used in all sorts of performance PC builds. However, few are using large artistic castings as radiators like [Mac Pierce] is doing.\u00a0\nThe casting itself was inspired on the concept of the ouroboros, the snake which eats its own tail if one remembers correctly. [Mac] built a wooden form to produce a loop approximately 30 tall and 24 wide, before carving it into the classic snake design. The mold was then used to produce a hefty sand cast part which weighed in at just over 30 pounds.\nThe next problem was to figure out how to create a sealed water channel in the casting to use it as a radiator. This was achieved by machining finned cooling channels into the surface of the snake itself. A polycarbonate face plate was then produced to bolt over this, creating a sealed system. [Mac] also had to work hard to find a supply of aluminum-compatible water cooling fittings to ensure he didnt run into any issues with galvanic corrosion.\nThe final product worked, and looked great to boot, even if it took many disassembly cycles to fix all the leaks. The blood-red coolant was a nice touch that really complemented the silvery aluminum. CPU temperatures werent as good as with a purpose-built PC radiator, but maxed out at 51 C in a heavy load test\u2014servicable for [Mac]s uses. The final touch was to simply build the rest of the PC to live inside the ouroboros itself\u2014and the results were stunning.\nWeve featured a few good watercooling builds over the years.

Now, that very tool is available on the Commodore 64 via the Internet.\nObviously, a 6502 CPU with just 64 kilobytes of RAM can barely remember a dictionary, let alone the work with something as complicated as a modern large language model. Nor is the worlds best-selling computer well-equipped to connect to modern online APIs. Instead, the C64 can access ChatGPT through the Retrocampus BBS, as demonstrated by [Retro Tech or Die].\nDue to security reasons, the ChatGPT area of the BBS is only available to the boards Patreon members. Once in, though, youre granted a prompt with ChatGPT displayed in glorious PETSCII on the Commodore 64. Its all handled via a computer running as a go-between for the BBS clients and OpenAIs ChatGPT service, set up by board manager [Francesco Sblendorio].\u00a0Its particularly great to see ChatGPT spitting out C64-compatible BASIC.\nWhile this is a fun use of ChatGPT, be wary of using it for certain tasks in wider society. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Nick W. for the tip!]\n"}

The OpenMuscle finger tracking sensor can offer the data you need, and its a device you can readily build in your own workshop.\nThe device consists of a wrist cuff that mounts twelve pressure sensors, arranged radially about the forearm. The pressure sensors are a custom design, using magnets, hall effect senors, and springs to detect the motion of the muscles in the vicinity of the wrist.\nWe first looked at this project last year, and since then, its advanced in leaps and bounds. The basic data from the pressure sensors now feeds into a trained machine learning model, which then predicts the users actual finger movements.\u00a0The long-term goal is to create a device that can control prosthetic hands based on muscle contractions in the forearm. Ideally, this would be super-intuitive to use, requiring a minimum of practice and training for the end user.\nIts great to see machine learning combined with innovative mechanical design to serve a real need. We cant wait to see where the OpenMuscle project goes next.\n\n\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

[Liam Powell] aims to introduce some more variety with the development of Prunt, a 3D printer control board and firmware stack.Smooth motion control is Prunt\u2019s biggest advantage: Klipper and Marlin use trapezoidal (three-phase) motion profiles, which aim for acceleration changes with physically impossible rapidity, leading to vibrations and ringing on prints. By contrast, Prunt uses a more physically realistic 31-phase motion profile. This lets the user independently adjust velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, and crackle (the increasingly higher-order derivatives of position with respect to time) to reduce vibration and create smoother prints. To avoid sharp accelerations, Prunt can also turn corners into 15-degree B\u00e9zier curves.The focus on smooth motion isn\u2019t just a software feature; the Prunt control board uses hardware timers to control step generation, rather than the CPU. This avoids the timing issues which Klipper sometimes faces, and avoids slowing other parts of the program down. The board also seems to have a particular focus on avoiding electrical damage. It can detect short circuits in the heaters, thermistors, fans, and endstops, and can cut power and give the user a warning when one occurs. If the board somehow experiences a serious electrical fault, the USB port is isolated to prevent damage to the host computer. The firmwares source is available on GitHub. If you\u2019re more interested in well-established programs, we\u2019ve given a quick introduction to Klipper in the past. We\u2019ve also seen people develop their own firmware for the Bambu Lab X1."}

In the 1970s, if you studied radio, you might have seen the video from Universal Education and Visual Arts, titled Understanding Electronics Basic Radio Circuitry. The videos been restored, and it appears on the [CHAP] YouTube channel.\nThe video starts with a good history lesson that even covers Fessenden, which you rarely hear about. The video is full of old components that you may or may not remember, depending on your age. Theres a classic crystal radio at the start and it quickly moves to active receivers. Theres probably nothing in here you dont already know. On the other hand, radios work about the same today as they did in the 1970s, unless you count software-defined varieties.\nWe expect this was produced for the trade school market or, maybe, a super advanced high school shop class. There were more in the series, apparently, including ones on vacuum tubes, the transistor, and the principles of television.\nWe were sad that the credits dont mention the narrator. He sounded familiar. Maybe Robert Vaughn? Maybe not. A little research indicates the company was a division of Universal Studios, although the Library of Congress says it was actually produced by \u00a0Moreland-Latchford Productions in Toronto.\nMaybe these videos were the next step in becoming a child radio engineer. If you like old radio videos, this one is even older.\n\n", "title": "- 1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u300cUnderstanding Electronics Basic Radio Circuitry\u300d\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "body": "1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u7528\u52d5\u753b\u300cUnderstanding Electronics\u300d\u304cYouTube\u306b\u5fa9\u523b\u3002\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3084\u53e4\u3044\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6559\u80b2\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u300cUnderstanding Electronics Basic Radio Circuitry\u300d\u3092\u632f\u308a\u8fd4\u308b", "- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u56de\u8def\u3092\u5b66\u3076\uff1aYouTube\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u305f\u8cb4\u91cd\u306a\u6620\u50cf", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3092\u63a2\u308b\u52d5\u753b", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u304b\u3089\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u3078\uff1a\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5909\u9077\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "- \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u767a\u898b\u3059\u308b"]}

You could just take water, sunscreen, and a hat. Or, you could take a rad glowing witchs staff to really draw some eyes and have some fun. [MZandtheRaspberryPi] recently undertook just such a build for a friend and we love how it turned out.\nThe concept was to build a staff or cane with a big glowing orb on top. The aim was to 3D print the top as a very thin part so that LEDs inside could glow through it. Eventually, after much trial and error, the right combination of design and printer settings made this idea work. A Pi Pico W was then employed as the brains of the operation, driving a number of through-hole Neopixel LEDs sourced from Adafruit.\nPower was courtesy of a long cable running out of the cane and to a USB power bank in the wielders pocket. Eventually, it was revealed this wasnt ideal for dancing with the staff. Thus, an upgrade came in the form of an Adafruit Feather microcontroller and a 2,000 mAh lithium-polymer battery tucked inside the orb. The Feathers onboard hardware made managing the lithium cell a cinch, and there were no more long cables to worry about.\nThe result? A neat costume prop that looks fantastic. A bit of 3D printing and basic electronics is all you need these days to build fun glowing projects, and we always love to see them. Halloween is right around the corner  if youre building something awesome for your costume, dont hesitate to let us know!"}

But plenty of common objects emit various particles, and it turns out that detecting these particles does not require government backing or acres of test equipment. In fact, you can get this job done with a few readily-available parts and [Tim] shows us how its done with his latest project.\nThe goal of his build is to have a working particle detector for less than $10 per board, although hes making them in bulk to be used in an educational setting. The board uses a set of photodiodes enclosed in a protective PCB sandwich to detect beta particles from a Potassium-40 source. The high-energy electron interacts with the semiconductor in the photodiode and creates a measurable voltage pulse, which can be detected and recorded by the microcontroller on the board. For this build an RP2040 chip is being used, with a number of layers of amplification between it and the photodetector array used to get signals that the microcontroller can read.\nGetting particle physics equipment into the hands of citizen scientists is becoming a lot more common thanks to builds like this which leverage the quirks of semiconductors to do something slightly outside their normal use case, and of course the people building them releasing their projects documentation on GitHub. Weve also seen an interesting muon detector with a price tag of around $100 and an alpha particle detector which uses a copper wire with a high voltage to do its work.", "title": "10\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7c92\u5b50\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304b\u3089\u7c92\u5b50\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u304c\u3001\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3084\u5e0c\u5c11\u306a\u5143\u7d20\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3001Tim\u304c$10\u672a\u6e80\u3067\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u5e02\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u8005\u306e\u624b\u306b\u3082\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u6a5f\u5668\u304c\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["10\u30c9\u30eb\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7c92\u5b50\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5341\u5206\u306a\u7c92\u5b50\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u88c5\u7f6e\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3044", "\u5bb9\u6613\u306b\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u7c92\u5b50\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5e02\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306b\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u7c92\u5b50\u691c\u51fa\u5668\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

[Mini Construction] did, apparently, and theres a timelapse of the build in the video below.\nWe wished this was more of a how-to video, although if you are handy with brickwork, the mechanical construction seems straightforward. Presumably, youd need to understand how much force the water had but we dont know if there was math involved or just seat-of-the-pants design.\n\nWe were unclear what the tower was for until we saw the turbine installed in it. We werent clear where it came from, and it looked like maybe it was repurposed from something else. If you recognize what it is, or have a guess, drop a comment, will you? While the brickwork was impressive, the wiring  especially near water  looked a bit suspect. We hope that was just test wiring and a more permanent arrangement was made later.\nWe have seen hacker hydroelectric before, but rarely. Waterwheels seem much more common. Honestly, the masonry work was the best weve seen since [Walt] built a bomb shelter.\n"}

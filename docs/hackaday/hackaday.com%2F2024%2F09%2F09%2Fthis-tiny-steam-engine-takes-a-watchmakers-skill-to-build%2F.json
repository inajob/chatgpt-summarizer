If we were to put the footprint of this engine into SMD context, wed say its around a 2010 or so. As one would expect, the design is minimalistic, with no room for traditional bearings or valves. The piston and connecting rod are one piece, meaning the cylinder must pivot, which provides a clever way of switching between intake and exhaust. Tiny crankshaft, tiny flywheel. Everything youd associate with a steam engine is there, but just barely.\nThe tooling needed to accomplish this feat is pretty impressive too. [Chronova] are no strangers to precision work, but this is a step beyond. Almost everything was done on a watchmakers lathe with a milling attachment and a microscope assist. For the main body of the engine, a pantograph engraving machine was enlisted to scale a 3D printed template down tenfold. Drill bits in the 0.3 mm range didnt fare too well against annealed tool steel, which is where the scanning electron microscope came into play. It revealed brittle fractures in the carbide tool, which prompted a dive down the rabbit hole of micro-machining and a switch to high-speed steel tooling.\nIt all worked in the end, enough so that the engine managed 42,000 RPM on a test with compressed air. We eagerly await the equally tiny boiler for a live steam test.\n\n", "title": "\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u6d88\u3057\u30b4\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u84b8\u6c17\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "body": "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u84b8\u6c17\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u304c\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306f\u30df\u30cb\u30de\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30d9\u30a2\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u30d0\u30eb\u30d6\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30d4\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\u3068\u9023\u7d50\u30ed\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u4e00\u4f53\u3002\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u5099\u308f\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u56de\u8ee2\u6570\u306f42,000 RPM\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30f3\u30b7\u30eb\u6d88\u3057\u30b4\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u84b8\u6c17\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c", "\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30af\u30ed\u306a\u5de5\u4f5c", "2010\u5e74\u306b\u76f8\u5f53\u3059\u308b\u8d85\u5c0f\u578b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3", "\u5168\u3066\u304c\u6975\u5c0f\u306b\u8a70\u3081\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u305f\u84b8\u6c17\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c17\u306742,000 RPM\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u56de\u8ee2\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30df\u30cb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3"]}

To his and our surprise, the circuit board and its beautiful array of LEDs seem to be in excellent condition, so he moves on to cleaning the case itself.\nThe case, on the other hand, is a bit dirty on the outside, so [Vintage Apparatus] takes out the buttons and starts cleaning with the back cover a Q-tip. After a bit of scrubbing and some extra care to avoid removing any stickers, he moves on to the considerably dirtier and somewhat scratched front case. After some wrestling with the creases and speaker grill of the front cover, the outside of the front case looks nice and clean. Finally, he puts back the buttons and circuit board in the front cover before adding closing it all up with the back cover and screwing it back together.\nThe game, which immediately comes to life and was actually made by the Mattel calculator division, is a sort of evasion game where the player is a bright dot that can move forward, up or down. The player avoids the dimmer dots, the tacklers, in order to run as far as possible as fast as possible. When one of the tacklers tackles the player, the amount of downs is increased and the fifth down means game over. After either scoring or getting downed one too many times, the field is flipped and its now player 2s turn.\nVideo after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f1977\u5e74\u306e\u30de\u30c6\u30eb\u96fb\u5b50\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "body": "\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30687\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u7269\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f1977\u5e74\u306e\u30de\u30c6\u30eb\u96fb\u5b50\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300cLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30687\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300d", "\u300c\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30d7\u30e9\u30bf\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6383\u9664\u3068\u4fee\u5fa9\u300d", "\u300c\u30de\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u653b\u6483\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046\u300d", "\u300c\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3067\u518d\u751f\u3055\u308c\u308b\u5fd8\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u697d\u3057\u307f\u300d"]}

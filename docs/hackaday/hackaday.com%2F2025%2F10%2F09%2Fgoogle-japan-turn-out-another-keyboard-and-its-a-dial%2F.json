It replaces keys with a series of dials that work in the same way as the telephone dial of old. Could you dial your way through typing?\nAll the files to make the board, as well as a build guide, are in the GitHub repository linked above, but theyve also released a promotional video that weve put below the break. The dials use 3D printed parts, and a rotary encoder to detect the key in question. We remember from back in the day how there were speed dialing techniques with dial phones, something weve probably by now lost the muscle memory for.\nWe like this board for its quirkiness, and while it might become a little tedious to type a Hackaday piece on it, there might be some entertainment for old-timers in watching the youngsters figuring it out. If youre hungry for more, weve covered them before.\n\n\nThanks [ikeji] for the tip.", "title": "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "Google Japan\u304c\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u767a\u8868\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u96fb\u8a71\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u3092\u56de\u3057\u3066\u5165\u529b\u3059\u308b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304d\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- Google Japan\u306e\u5947\u629c\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u5f0f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u3067\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01", "- \u82e5\u8005\u304c\u6311\u3080\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u5f0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u4f53\u9a13", "- \u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u5f0f\u3067\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3001\u7b4b\u8089\u8a18\u61b6\u3092\u5931\u3063\u305f\u4e16\u4ee3\u3078"]}

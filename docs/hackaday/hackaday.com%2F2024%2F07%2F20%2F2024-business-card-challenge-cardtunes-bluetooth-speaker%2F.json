[Schwimmflugel] aimed to create a speaker out of two coils made from flexible circuit board material, driving them with opposite polarities to create a thin speaker without the need for a permanent magnet.\n\nThe concept is sound, but in practice, performance was poor. One could identify the song being played, but only if holding the speaker up to ones ear. The output was improved considerably with the addition of a small permanent magnet behind the card, but of course this compromised the original vision.\nEven though the concept of making a speaker from two flexible PCB panel coils had only mixed success, we love seeing this kind of effort and theres a lot to learn from the results. Not to mention that its frankly fantastic to even have a Bluetooth speaker on a business card in the first place.\nThe 2024 Business Card Challenge is over, but judging by all the incredible entries we received, were thinking it probably wont be too long before we come up with another sized-constrained challenge.\n\n\n \n\n"}

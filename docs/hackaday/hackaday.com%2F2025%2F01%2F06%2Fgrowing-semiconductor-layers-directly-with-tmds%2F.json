Recently, a team of researchers has demonstrated the use of TMDs as an alternative to through-silicon-vias (TSV), which is the current way that multiple layers of silicon semiconductor circuitry are stacked, as seen with, e.g., NAND Flash ICs and processors with stacked memory dice. The novelty here is that the new circuitry is grown directly on top of the existing circuitry, removing the need for approaches like TSV to turn 2D layers into 3D stacks.\nAs reported in the paper in\u00a0Nature\u00a0by [Ki Seok Kim] and colleagues (gift article), this technique of monolithic 3D (M3D) integration required overcoming a number of technological challenges, most of all enabling the new TMD single-crystals to grow at low enough temperatures that it doesnt destroy the previously created circuitry. The progress is detailed in the papers schematic (pictured above): from TSV to M3D by transfer of layers and high- and low-temperature growth of single-crystal layers.\n\nUltimately, the demonstration device with vertically grown transistor arrays (nMOS and pMOS) on a silicon substrate was grown at 385\u2103, which, if commercially developed, could mean a significant boost in transistor density and possibly the development of 3D semiconductor circuits rather than stacked 2D ones. We are still worried about making them the old-fashioned way.", "title": "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\uff08TMD\uff09\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u9077\u79fb\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9(TMD)\u304c\u30b7\u30ea\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u6750\u6599\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853\u30673D\u7a4d\u5c64\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\uff08TMD\uff09\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u6280\u8853", "- \u65b0\u305f\u306a3D\u96c6\u7a4d\u56de\u8def\u6280\u8853\u300cM3D\u300d\u306e\u5b9f\u73fe\u3068\u305d\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u4f4e\u6e29\u6210\u9577\u6280\u8853\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u914d\u5217", "- \u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306aTSV\u304b\u3089M3D\u3078\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- TMD\u6750\u6599\u304c\u5909\u3048\u308b\u672a\u6765\u306e\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3068\u6027\u80fd"]}

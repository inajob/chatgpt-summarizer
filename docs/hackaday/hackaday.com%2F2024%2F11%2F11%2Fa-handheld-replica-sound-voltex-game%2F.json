[Luke] is a big fan, so decided to build a hardware handheld to play the Unnamed Sound Voltex Clone.\u00a0 No\u2014Voltex is not a typo, thats the name.\nIf youre unfamiliar, the Unnamed SDVX Clone is basically a community-built game thats inspired by the original Konami titles. [Luke] decided to build a handheld console for playing the game, which is more akin to the arcade experience versus playing it on a desktop computer.\n[Lukes] build relies on a Raspberry Pi 4B, which donates its considerable processing power and buckets of RAM to the project. The Pi was installed into a 3D-printed case with a battery pack, touchscreen, and speakers, along with multiple arcade buttons\u00a0 and rotary encoders for controlling the game. Booting the Pi and clicking the icon on the desktop starts up the Unnamed Sound Voltex Clone. The game itself will be fairly familiar to any rhythm game player, though its a tough more sophisticated than Audiosurf. [Luke] demonstrates the gameplay on YouTube, and the finished project looks great.\nWe always love seeing handheld hacks, from PlayStations that never were to retro DIY creations. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Sound Voltex\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u300d", "body": "\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u304cSound Voltex\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01Sound Voltex\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u7528\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97f3\u697d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d", "\u300c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u305f\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cSound Voltex\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u300d", "\u300c\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Unnamed Sound Voltex Clone\u306e\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u300d", "\u300c\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u97f3\u697d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f53\u9a13\u300d"]}

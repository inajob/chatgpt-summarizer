Over on GitHub [AnasMalas] has released a PCB edge USB-C connection symbol/footprint to do just that!\nThis isnt the first PCB edge USB-C connector weve seen, but this one has some nice features. Its available in both KiCad and EasyEDA formats, allowing you to easily add it into your preferred ECAD software. As well as supporting multiple software packages, there are two versions included: a 10-pin and 14-pin version. The 10-pin version has, on each side, 2 USB voltage pins, 2 ground pins, and a CC1 or CC2 pin on its respective side; this version is ideal if youre looking to just supply power via the connector. The 14-pin version has all the pins of the 10-pin version with the addition of four data-positive and data-negative pins needed to relay information to the board, ideal if youre planning on programming a microcontroller with this connection.\nOne important note is that, while most PCBs default to 1.6 mm thickness, if you use this connector youll need to drop that down to ~0.8 mm to properly interface with a common USB cable. [AnasMalas] also suggests using ENIG board finish to preserve the connectors on your USB cable.\nFor such a small and common connector, USB-C holds a ton of potential. Be sure to check out our series all about USB-C for more details.\nThanks to [Ben] for the tip."}

But there are still some components which are expensive, one of which is a decent quality HD wireless monitor. Along comes [FuzzyLogic] with a solution, in the form of an external monitor for a laptop, driven by a wireless HDMI extender.\nIn one sense this project involves plugging in a series of components and simply using them for their intended purpose, however its more than that in that it involves some rather useful 3D printed parts to make a truly portable wireless monitor, as well as saving the rest of us the gamble of buying wireless HDMI extender without knowing whether it would deliver.\nHe initially tried an HDMI-to-USB dongle and a streaming Raspberry Pi, however the latency was far too high to be useful. The extender does have a small delay, but not so bad as to be unusable. The whole including the monitor can be powered from a large USB power bank, answering one of our questions. All the files can be downloaded from Printables should you wish to follow the same path, and meanwhile theres a video with the details below the break.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u3068\u30cf\u30a4\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u767b\u5834\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u5236\u4f5c\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u304c\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306aHD\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u307e\u3060\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001[FuzzyLogic]\u304c\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9HDMI\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u7528\u306e\u5916\u90e8\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306aHD\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9HDMI\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30ec\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc"]}

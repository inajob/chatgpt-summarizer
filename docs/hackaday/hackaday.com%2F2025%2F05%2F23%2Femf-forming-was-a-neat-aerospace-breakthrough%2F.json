But what if magnets could do the squeezing? As it turns out\u2014Grumman Aerospace discovered they can, several decades ago! Even better, they summed up this technique in a great educational video which weve placed below the break.\nThe video concerns the development of the Grumman EMF Torque Tube. The parts are essentially tubes with gear-like fittings mounted in either end, which are fixed with electromagnetic forming techniques instead of riveting or crimping. Right away, were told the key benefits\u2014torque tubes built this way are stronger, lighter, and more fatigue resistant than those built with conventional techniques. Grumman used these torque tubes in such famous aircraft as the F-14 Tomcat, highlighting their performance and reliability.\n\nBefore\nand after. The part is formed and the coil is destroyed.\nThe video goes on to explain the basics of the EMF torque tube production process. A tube is placed inside a coil, with the end fitting then installed inside. A capacitor bank dumps current through the coil to generate a strong electromagnetic field. This field is opposed by a secondary field generated by eddy currents. The two forces result in an explosive force which drives the tube inwards, gripping into the grooves of the end fitting, and destroys the coil in the process. Grumman notes that it specifically optimized a grooving profile for bonding tubes with end fittings, which maximised the strength of these EMF-produced joints.\nThis tip was sent in by [irox]. The video itself was posted by [Greg Benoit], who notes his father Robert Benoit was intimately involved with the development of the technique. Indeed, it was useful enough that the technology was licensed to Boeing, generating many millions of dollars for Grumman.\nWe feature all kinds of machining and forming techniques here, but this sort of forming isnt something we see a lot of around these parts. Still, were sure someone will be Kickstarting a home EMF forming machine before the end of next week.\n", "title": "- \u78c1\u529b\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5f62\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u822a\u7a7a\u304c\u767a\u898b\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u78c1\u5f62\u6210\u6280\u8853\u306f\u3001\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3001\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3057\u75b2\u52b4\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u78c1\u529b\u3067\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u5f62\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- \u30b0\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u306eEMF\u30c8\u30eb\u30af\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u958b\u767a\u79d8\u8a71", "- \u78c1\u6c17\u6210\u5f62\u306e\u5f37\u5ea6\u3068\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u52a0\u5de5\u6cd5", "- \u5bb6\u5ead\u7528EMF\u6210\u5f62\u6a5f\u306e\u672a\u6765\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b"]}

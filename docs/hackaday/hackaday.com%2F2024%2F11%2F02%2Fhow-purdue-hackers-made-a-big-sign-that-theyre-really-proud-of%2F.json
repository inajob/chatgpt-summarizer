Maybe you want to celebrate that fact with some visually appealing signage? Well, thats pretty much how [Jack] of the Purdue Hackers felt, so he and the gang put together a sizable logo sign to advertise their makerspace.\n[Jack] explains that The Sign, as it is known, embodies the spirit of the Purdue Hackers. Basically, its about making something cool and sharing it with the world. He then outlines how they came to develop a shining monument to their organization with the use of LEDs and 3D printed components. The blog post explains how the group began with small prototypes, before stepping up to build a larger version for display in their makerspace window. It also chronicles the twists and turns of the project, including budget snarls and PCB errors that threatened to derail everything.\nUltimately, though, the Purdue Hackers prevailed, and The Sign has been shining bright ever since. Files are on GitHub for the curious, because its all open source!

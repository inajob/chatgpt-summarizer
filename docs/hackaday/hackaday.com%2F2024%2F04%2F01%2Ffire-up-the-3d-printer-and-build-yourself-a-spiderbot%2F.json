Looking for a new project? All of the design details are shared online if youd like to make a hexapod of your own.\nWe like the effort [Atlin] put into minimizing hardware fasteners in the design of the 3D-printed parts, and aiming for a modular concept that leaves things open for expansion or modification. Theres plenty of room in the chassis for more hardware, with a convenient peg system for snap-fitting assemblies.\nControl is done wirelessly via a mobile phone with an app created using the MIT App Inventor, a fantastic tool that is still going strong as a capable and accessible way to make an Android app.\nAs for the ESP32-CAM module that drives it all, it is a great piece of hardware with capabilities that are leveraged very nicely here. Weve seen other projects make good use of it as well, from this 1/64 scale micro RC car to an oddball tripod camera robot.\n\n"}

Many pieces of modern hardware have been coaxed into playing id Softwares 1993 classic, but there have always been some older machines that just didnt have the power to do it. One of them has now been conquered though, and its a doozy. [Frenkel]s Doom8088, as its name suggests, is a port of the game for the original PC and AT.\nAs can be seen in this gameplay video, its not always the slickest of gaming experiences. But it works, so the question is, how on earth can a machine that was below the spec of the original, run this game? The answer comes in it being a port of GBADoom for the Game Boy Advance, a platform with less memory than a DOS PC. It still relies on extensive hard disk access for every frame though, which leaves it snail-like.\nWe set out to install it ourselves on one of the web based PC emulators, but fell over on the size of the required Watcom installation. If any of you have the real thing lying around though, wed love to hear about how the game performed in the comments.\nWeve shown you so many ports of DOOM over the years to have lost count. One of our favourite recent ones uses an extremely unconventional but very retro display."}

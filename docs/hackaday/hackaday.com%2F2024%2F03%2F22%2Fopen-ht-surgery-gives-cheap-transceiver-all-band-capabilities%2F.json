While certainly a useful capability, these bands are usually quite range-limited, and generally require fixed repeaters to cover a decent geographic area. For long-range comms you want to be on the high-frequency (HF) bands, and you want modulations other than the FM-only offered by most of the cheap HT radios.\nLuckily, theres a fix for both problems, as [Paul (OM0ET)] outlines in the video below. Its a two-step process that starts with installing a hardware kit to replace the radios stock receiver chip with the much more capable Si4732. The kit includes the chip mounted on a small PCB, a new RF choke, and a bunch of nearly invisible capacitors. The mods are straightforward but would certainly benefit from the help of a microscope, and perhaps a little hot air rework. Once the hardware is installed and the new firmware flashed, you have an HT that can receive signals down to the 20-meter band, with AM and SSB modulations, and a completely redesigned display with all kinds of goodies.\nIts important to note that this is a receive-only modification  you wont be transmitting on the HF bands with this thing. However, it appears that the firmware allows you to switch back and forth between HF receive and VHF/UHF transceive, so the radios stock functionality is still there if you need it. But at $30 for the radio and $12 for the kit, who cares? Having a portable HF receiver could be pretty handy in some situations. This looks like yet another fun hack for this radio; weve seen a few recently, including a firmware-only band expansion and even a Trojan that adds a waterfall display and a game of Pong.\n\nThanks to [KC] for the tip.", "title": "Quansheng UV-K5\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "Quansheng UV-K5\u306f\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u3067\u3001HF\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u53d7\u4fe1\u3084AM/SSB\u5909\u8abf\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6539\u9020\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001$30\u306e\u307f\u3002\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u904a\u3073\u5fc3\u3042\u308b\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u3002", "titles": ["Quansheng UV-K5\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u51fa\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "Baofeng\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\uff01\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u643a\u5e2f\u7121\u7dda\u6a5f\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u65b0\u8208\u52e2\u529b", "Quansheng UV-K5\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f", "\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u3092DIY\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2", "\u9ad8\u5468\u6ce2\u5e2f\u53d7\u4fe1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aQuansheng UV-K5\u306e\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

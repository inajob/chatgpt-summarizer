Having done the coast-to-coast trip seven times now, I cant agree. Sure, the stretches through the Corn Belt get a little monotonous, but for someone like me who wants to know how everything works, even endless agriculture is fascinating; I love me some center-pivot irrigation.\nOne thing that has always attracted my attention while on these long road trips is the weigh stations that pop up along the way, particularly when you transition from one state to another. Maybe its just getting a chance to look at something other than wheat, but weigh stations are interesting in their own right because of everything thats going on in these massive roadside plazas. Gone are the days of a simple pull-off with a mechanical scale that was closed far more often than it was open. Todays weigh stations are critical infrastructure installations that are bristling with sensors to provide a multi-modal insight into the state of the trucks  and drivers  plying our increasingly crowded highways.\n\nAll About the Axles\nBefore diving into the nuts and bolts of weigh stations, it might be helpful to discuss the rationale behind infrastructure whose main function, at least to the casual observer, seems to be making the truck drivers job even more challenging, not to mention less profitable. Weve all probably sped by long lines of semi trucks queued up for the scales alongside a highway, pitying the poor drivers and wondering if the whole endeavor is worth the diesel being wasted.\nThe answer to that question boils down to one word: axles. In the United States, the maximum legal gross vehicle weight (GVW) for a fully loaded semi truck is typically 40 tons, although permits are issued for overweight vehicles. The typical 18-wheeler will distribute that load over five axles, which means each axle transmits 16,000 pounds of force into the pavement, assuming an even distribution of weight across the length of the vehicle. Studies conducted in the early 1960s revealed that heavier trucks caused more damage to roadways than lighter passenger vehicles, and that the increase in damage is proportional to the fourth power of axle weight. So, keeping a close eye on truck weights is critical to protecting the highways.\nJust how much damage trucks can cause to pavement is pretty alarming. Each axle of a truck creates a compression wave as it rolls along the pavement, as much as a few millimeters deep, depending on road construction and loads. The relentless cycle of compression and expansion results in pavement fatigue and cracks, which let water into the interior of the roadway. In cold weather, freeze-thaw cycles exert tremendous forces on the pavement that can tear it apart in short order. The greater the load on the truck, the more stress it puts on the roadway and the faster it wears out.\nThe other, perhaps more obvious reason to monitor axles passing over a highway is that theyre critical to truck safety. A trucks axles have to support huge loads in a dynamic environment, and every component mounted to each axle, including springs, brakes, and wheels, is subject to huge forces that can lead to wear and catastrophic failure. Complete failure of an axle isnt uncommon, and a driver can be completely unaware that a wheel has detached from a trailer and become an unguided missile bouncing down the highway. Regular inspections of the running gear on trucks and trailers are critical to avoiding these potentially catastrophic occurrences.\n\nWays to Weigh\nThe first thing youll likely notice when driving past one of the approximately 700 official weigh stations lining the US Interstate highway system is how much space they take up. In contrast to the relatively modest weigh stations of the past, modern weigh stations take up a lot of real estate. Most weigh stations are optimized to get the greatest number of trucks processed as quickly as possible, which means constructing multiple lanes of approach to the scale house, along with lanes that can be used by exempt vehicles to bypass inspection, and turnout lanes and parking areas for closer inspection of select vehicles.\nIn addition to the physical footprint of the weigh station proper, supporting infrastructure can often be seen miles in advance. Fixed signs are usually the first indication that youre getting near a weigh station, along with electronic signboards that can be changed remotely to indicate if the weigh station is open or closed. Signs give drivers time to figure out if they need to stop at the weigh station, and to begin the process of getting into the proper lane to negotiate the exit. Most weigh stations also have a net of sensors and cameras mounted to poles and overhead structures well before the weigh station exit. These are monitored by officers in the station to spot any trucks that are trying to avoid inspections.\nOverhead view of a median weigh station on I-90 in Haugan, Montana.

Source: Google Maps.\nMost weigh stations in the US are located off the right side of the highway, as left-hand exit ramps are generally more dangerous than right exits. Still, a single weigh station located in the median of the highway can serve traffic from both directions, so the extra risk of accidents from exiting the highway to the left is often outweighed by the savings of not having to build two separate facilities. Either way, the main feature of a weigh station is the scale house, a building with large windows that offer a commanding view of the entire plaza as well as an up-close look at the trucks passing over the scales embedded in the pavement directly adjacent to the structure.\nScales at a weigh station are generally of two types: static scales, and weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems. A static scale is a large platform, called a weighbridge, set into a pit in the inspection lane, with the surface flush with the roadway. The platform floats within the pit, supported by a set of cantilevers that transmit the force exerted by the truck to electronic load cells. The signal from the load cells is cleaned up by signal conditioners before going to analog-to-digital converters and being summed and dampened by a scale controller in the scale house.\nThe weighbridge on a static scale is usually long enough to accommodate an entire semi tractor and trailer, which accurately weighs the entire vehicle in one measurement. The disadvantage is that the entire truck has to come to a complete stop on the weighbridge to take a measurement. Add in the time it takes for the induced motion of the weighbridge to settle, along with the time needed for the driver to make a slow approach to the scale, and each measurement can add up to significant delays for truckers.\nWeigh-in-motion sensor. WIM systems measure the force exerted by each axle and calculate a total gross vehicle weight (GVW) for the truck while it passes over the sensor. The spacing between axles is also measured to ensure compliance with state laws. Source: Central Carolina Scales, Inc.\nTo avoid these issues, weigh-in-motion systems are often used. WIM systems use much the same equipment as the weighbridge on a static scale, although they tend to use piezoelectric sensors rather than traditional strain-gauge load cells, and usually have a platform thats only big enough to have one axle bear on it at a time. A truck using a WIM scale remains in motion while the force exerted by each axle is measured, allowing the controller to come up with a final GVW as well as weights for each axle. While some WIM systems can measure the weight of a vehicle at highway speed, most weigh stations require trucks to keep their speed pretty slow, under five miles per hour. This is obviously for everyones safety, and even though the somewhat stately procession of trucks through a WIM can still plug traffic up, keeping trucks from having to come to a complete stop and set their brakes greatly increases weigh station throughput.\nAnother advantage of WIM systems is that the spacing between axles can be measured. The speed of the truck through the scale can be measured, usually using a pair of inductive loops embedded in the roadway around the WIM sensors. Knowing the vehicles speed through the scale allows the scale controller to calculate the distance between axles. Some states strictly regulate the distance between a trailers kingpin, which is where it attaches to the tractor, and the trailers first axle. Trailers that are not in compliance can be flagged and directed to a parking area to await a service truck to come by to adjust the spacing of the trailer bogie.\nKeep It Moving, Buddy\nA PrePass transponder reader and antenna over Interstate 10 near Pearlington, Mississippi.

To reduce congestion further, some states participate in automatic bypass systems. These systems, generically known as PrePass for the specific brand with the greatest market penetration, use in-cab transponders that are interrogated by transmitters mounted over the roadway well in advance of the weigh station. The transponder code is sent to PrePass for authentication, and if the truck ID comes back to a company that has gone through the PrePass certification process, a signal is sent to the transponder telling the driver to bypass the weigh station. The transponder lights a green LED in this case, which stays lit for about 15 minutes, just in case the driver gets stopped by an overzealous trooper who mistakes the truck for a scofflaw.\nPrePass transponders are just one aspect of an entire suite of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) systems used in the typical modern weigh station. Most weigh stations are positively bristling with cameras, some of which are dedicated to automatic license plate recognition. These are integrated into the scale controller system and serve to associate WIM data with a specific truck, so violations can be flagged. They also help with the enforcement of traffic laws, as well as locating human traffickers, an increasingly common problem. Weigh stations also often have laser scanners mounted on bridges over the approach lanes to detect unpermitted oversized loads. Image analysis systems are also used to verify the presence and proper operation of required equipment, such a mirrors, lights, and mudflaps. Some weigh stations also have systems that can interrogate the electronic logging device inside the cab to verify that the driver isnt in violation of hours of service laws, which dictate how long a driver can be on the road before taking breaks.\nSensors Galore\nIR cameras watch for heat issues on trucks at a Kentucky weigh station.

Infrared cameras are often used to scan for excessive heat being emitted by an axle, often a sign of worn or damaged brakes. The status of a trucks tires can also be monitored thanks to Tire Anomaly and Classification Systems (TACS), which use in-road sensors that can analyze the contact patch of each tire while the vehicle is in motion. TACS can detect flat tires, over- and under-inflated tires, tires that are completely missing from an axle, or even mismatched tires. Any of these anomalies can cause a tire to quickly wear out and potentially self-destruct at highway speeds, resulting in catastrophic damage to surrounding traffic.\nTrucks with problems are diverted by overhead signboards and direction arrows to inspection lanes. There, trained truck inspectors will closely examine the flagged problem and verify the violation. If the problem is relatively minor, like a tire inflation problem, the driver might be able to fix the issue and get back on the road quickly. Trucks that cant be made safe immediately might have to wait for mobile service units to come fix the problem, or possibly even be taken off the road completely. Only after the vehicle is rendered road-worthy again can you keep on trucking.\nFeatured image: WeighStationSign by [Wasted Time R]", "title": "\u7c73\u56fd\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "body": "\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u3067\u3001\u8ca8\u7269\u8eca\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3068\u9053\u8def\u4fdd\u8b77\u306b\u5bc4\u4e0e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u7c73\u56fd\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5b89\u5168\u3092\u5b88\u308b\uff1a\u8eca\u8ef8\u76e3\u8996\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u62b1\u3048\u308b\u8ab2\u984c\u3068\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56", "\u6e2c\u5b9a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u9759\u7684\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u52d5\u7684\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u81ea\u52d5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d1\u30b9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9"]}

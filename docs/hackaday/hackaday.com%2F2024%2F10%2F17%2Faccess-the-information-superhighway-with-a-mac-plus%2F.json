While this reputation is somewhat deserved, especially in recent years, it seems less true for their older machines. With the second and perhaps most influential computer, the Apple II, being so upgradable that the machine had a production run of nearly two decades. Similarly, the Macintosh Plus of 1986 was surprisingly upgradable and repairable and [Hunter] demonstrates its capabilities by bringing one onto the modern Internet, albeit with a few tricks to adapt the old hardware and software to the modern era.\nThe Mac Plus was salvaged from a thrift store, and the first issue to solve was that it had some rotten capacitors that had to be replaced before the computer could be reliably powered on at all. [Hunter] then got to work bringing this computer online, with the only major hardware modification being a BlueSCSI hard drive emulator which allows using an SD card instead of an original hard disk. It can also emulate an original Macintosh Ethernet card, allowing it to fairly easily get online.\nThe original operating system and browser dont support modern protocols such as HTTPS or scripting languages like Javascript or CSS, so a tool called MacProxy was used to bridge this gap. It serves simplified HTML from the Internet to the Mac Plus, but [Hunter] wanted it to work even better, adding modular domain-specific handling to allow the computer to more easily access sites like Reddit, YouTube, and even Hackaday, although he does call us out a bit for not maintaining our retro page perhaps as well as it ought to be.\n[Hunter] has also built an extension to use the Wayback Machine to serve websites to the Mac from a specific date in the past, which really enhances the retro feel of using a computer like this to access the Internet. Of course, if you dont have original Macintosh hardware but still want to have the same experience of the early Internet or retro hardware this replica Mac will get you there too.\n\n", "title": "Apple II\u304b\u3089Mac Plus: \u53e4\u3044Mac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "body": "Apple\u306f\u30ea\u30da\u30a2\u3084\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3068\u8a55\u5224\u3060\u304c\u3001Apple II\u3084Macintosh Plus\u306f20\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u307b\u3069\u67d4\u8edf\u3002\u53e4\u3044Mac Plus\u3082\u8fd1\u4ee3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u3066\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001Wayback Machine\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["Apple II\u304b\u3089Mac Plus: \u53e4\u3044Mac\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u53e4\u3044Macintosh Plus\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5", "Mac Plus\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9: BlueSCSI\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "Macintosh Plus\u3067\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8: MacProxy\u306e\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30ec\u30c8\u30edMac\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080: Wayback Machine\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b"]}

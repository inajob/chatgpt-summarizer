These joints have been around for ages and can be executed with nothing more than chisels and a hand saw, plus a lot of practice, of course. But new tools bring new challenges and new opportunities in joinery, like this interesting hammer joint that can be made with a laser cutter.\nThis interesting joint comes to us from [Jiskar Schmitz], who designed it for quick, solid, joints without the need for glue or fasteners. Its a variation on a wedged mortise and tenon joint, which strengthens the standard version of the joint by using a wedge to expand the tenon outward to make firm contact with the walls of the tenon.\nThe hammer joint takes advantage of the thin kerf of a laser cutter and its ability to make blind cuts to produce a tenon with a built-in wedge. The wedge is attached to a slot in the tenon by a couple of thin connectors and stands proud of the top of the tenon. The tenon is inserted into a through-hole mortise, and a firm hammer blow on the wedge breaks it free and drives it into the slot. This expands the tenon and locks it tightly into the mortise, creating a fairly bulletproof joint. The video below tells the tale.\nWhile the hammer joint seems mainly aimed at birch plywood, [Jiskar] mentions testing it in other materials, such as bamboo, MDF, and even acrylic, although wood seems to be the best application. [Jiskar] also mentions a potential improvement: the addition of a ratchet and pawl shape between the wedge and the slot in the tenon, which might serve to lock the wedge down and prevent it from backing out.\n\n", "title": "\u7121\u63a5\u7740\u5264\u3067\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u63a5\u5408\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63a5\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u69ab\u3068\u6813\u63a5\u5408\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u3067\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u6253\u3061\u8fbc\u3080\u3053\u3068\u3067\u63a5\u5408\u304c\u5f37\u56fa\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6728\u6750\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u3082\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6539\u826f\u6848\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8\u3068\u69ab\u306e\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u9593\u306b\u30e9\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u7121\u63a5\u7740\u5264\u3067\u5f37\u529b\u306a\u63a5\u5408\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u63a5\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u6728\u5de5\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d: \u63a5\u5408\u529b\u3068\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30bd\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306a\u63a5\u5408\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d: \u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u7d20\u6750\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5fdc\u7528\u7bc4\u56f2\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u300c\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u300d: \u6728\u6750\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u4ed6\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u3067\u3082\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd"]}

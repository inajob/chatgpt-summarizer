Even with our love of all things 8-bit, though, were still somewhat blown away by [Matthew Begg]s BASIC interpreter written in 10 lines of BASIC. Its an entry in the BASIC 10-liner competition, and its written to run on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum.\nThe listing can be viewed as a PNG file on the linked page. It is enough to cause even the most seasoned retrocomputer enthusiasts a headache because, as you might expect, it pushes the limits of the language and the Sinclair interpreter.\u00a0 It implements Tiny Basic as a subset of the more full-featured BASICs, and hes the first to admit its not fast by any means. He gives a line-by-line explanation, and yes, its about as far away from the simple Frogger clones we remember bashing in on our Sinclairs as its possible to get.\nWe love it that there are still boundaries to be pushed, even on machines over four decades old, and especially that this one exceeds what we thought was a pretty good knowledge of Sinclair BASIC. Does this language still have a place in the world? We always look forward to the BASIC 10-liner competition.\nHeader: background by Bill Bertram, CC BY-SA 2.5."}

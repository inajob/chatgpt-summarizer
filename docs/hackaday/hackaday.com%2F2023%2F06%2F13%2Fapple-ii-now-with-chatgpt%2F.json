The program lives on a more modern computer and is accessed over a serial connection. OpenAI API credentials are stored in a file invoked by iiAI when you launch it by typing python3 openai_apple.py. The program should work on any device that supports TTY serial, but so far testing has only happened on [Michael]s Apple IIGS.\nFor a really clean setup, you might try running iiAI internally on an Apple II Pi. ChatGPT has also found its way onto Commodore 64 and MS-DOS, and look here if youd like some more info on how these AI chat bots work anyway.\n\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>document.createElement('video');<![endif]-->\nhttps://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/iiAI.mp4", "title": "Apple II\u306b\u3088\u308bChatGPT\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u305fPython\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u300ciiAI\u300d", "body": "Hackers are teaching Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS to communicate with artificial intelligence through the terminal, using Python program called iiAI.

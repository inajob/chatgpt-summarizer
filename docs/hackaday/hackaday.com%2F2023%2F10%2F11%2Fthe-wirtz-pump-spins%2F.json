If you want to move water to a lower elevation, theres no problem. But if you want to move water up, you need a pump. The ancients used what we call Archimedes screw to raise water. But a Wirtz pump as [Steve Mould] shows in the video below, is another kind of spiral pump that is also very old and uses the same basic principle as the screw pump.\nIn a way, the Wirtz is just an Archimedes screw in cross-section. Part of what makes it work, however, is air-locking. [Steve] made a small model but found it didnt work exactly as he expected. Of course, investigating that led to some interesting observations.\n\nTo solve the problem, a field trip to see a huge working Wirtz pump was in order. As it turns out, the size of the water channel is a balance. It cant be too small or too large. Surface tension plays a part, as does the transport of trapped air through the system.\n[Steve] learned some lessons and made another pump that  while not as stylish  worked much better. We couldnt help but think this would be easy to put together post-apocalypse, so probably a good thing to have in your bag of tricks.\nIf you have electricity and motors, of course, it is easy. You can even 3D print a centrifugal pump.\n", "title": "\"\u30a2\u30eb\u30ad\u30e1\u30c7\u30b9\u306e\u306d\u3058\u306e\u539f\u7406\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u306f\uff1f\"", "body": "\u6c34\u3092\u79fb\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u3001\u9ad8\u3044\u5834\u6240\u3078\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u306b\u306f\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u53e4\u4ee3\u4eba\u306f\u30a2\u30eb\u30ad\u30e1\u30c7\u30b9\u306e\u306d\u3058\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6c34\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30ef\u30fc\u30c4\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3082\u540c\u3058\u539f\u7406\u3067\u53e4\u304f\u304b\u3089\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5927\u304d\u306a\u30ef\u30fc\u30c4\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u898b\u5b66\u3057\u3001\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u96fb\u529b\u3084\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\"\u30a2\u30eb\u30ad\u30e1\u30c7\u30b9\u306e\u306d\u3058\u306e\u539f\u7406\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u306f\uff1f\"", "\"Wirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u3068\u306f\u3001\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6c34\u3092\u4e0a\u3078\u904b\u3076\u306e\u304b\uff1f\"", "\"Wirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u4f5c\u52d5\u539f\u7406\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8abf\u67fb\u7d50\u679c\"", "\"\u5de8\u5927\u306aWirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\u898b\u5b66\u65c5\u884c\u3067\u5f97\u305f\u77e5\u898b\"", "\"\u30dd\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30dd\u30ab\u30ea\u30d7\u30b9\u6642\u3067\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3001\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306eWirtz\u30dd\u30f3\u30d7\""]}

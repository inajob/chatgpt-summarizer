If you want to move water to a lower elevation, theres no problem. But if you want to move water up, you need a pump. The ancients used what we call Archimedes screw to raise water. But a Wirtz pump as [Steve Mould] shows in the video below, is another kind of spiral pump that is also very old and uses the same basic principle as the screw pump.\nIn a way, the Wirtz is just an Archimedes screw in cross-section. Part of what makes it work, however, is air-locking. [Steve] made a small model but found it didnt work exactly as he expected. Of course, investigating that led to some interesting observations.\n\nTo solve the problem, a field trip to see a huge working Wirtz pump was in order. As it turns out, the size of the water channel is a balance. It cant be too small or too large. Surface tension plays a part, as does the transport of trapped air through the system.\n[Steve] learned some lessons and made another pump that  while not as stylish  worked much better. We couldnt help but think this would be easy to put together post-apocalypse, so probably a good thing to have in your bag of tricks.\nIf you have electricity and motors, of course, it is easy. You can even 3D print a centrifugal pump.\n"}

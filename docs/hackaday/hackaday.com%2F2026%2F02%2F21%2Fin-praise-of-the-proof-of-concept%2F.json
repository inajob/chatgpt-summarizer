Case in point: this great demo of using a 64-point time-of-flight ranging sensor. [Henrique] took three modules, plugged them into a breadboard, and wrote some very interactive Python code that let him put them all through their paces. The result? I now absolutely want to set up a similar rig and expand on it.\nThat\u2019s the power of a strong proof of concept, and maybe a nice video presentation of it in action. What in particular makes [Henrique]\u2019s POC work is that he\u2019s written the software to give him a number of sliders, switches, and interaction that let him tweak things in real time and explore some of the possibilities. This exploratory software not only helped him map out what directions to go, but they also work in demo mode, when he\u2019s showing us what he has learned.\nBut the other thing that [Henrique]\u2019s video does nicely is to point out the limitations of his current POC. Instantly, the hacker mind goes \u201cI could work that out\u201d. Was it strategic incompleteness? Either way, I\u2019ve been nerd-sniped.\nSo are those the features of a good POC? It\u2019s the bare minimum to convey the idea, presented in a way that demonstrates a wide range of possibilities, and leaving that last little bit tantalizingly on the table?\n\nThis article is part of the Hackaday.com newsletter, delivered every seven days for each of the last 200+ weeks.

Now, its possible to fit decent computing power into a board the size of a stick of gum. [Electo] took advantage of this to build an entire computer into a mouse form factor.\n[Electo] had tried this before years ago, and built something pretty sloppy. This time, he wanted to build a version that had an actually-legible screen and fit better in the hand. He whipped up a giant 3D-printed mouse housing, and fitted the sensor board from an optical mouse inside. That was hooked up to an Intel NUC PC that fits inside the housing. A small LCD screen was then installed on a rack system that lets it pop out the front of the mouse. Data entry is via a laser keyboard mounted in the side of the mouse.\nOf course, being based on an Intel NUC means the thing was the size of a couple of phonebooks. Thats not really a mouse. Starting again, he reworked the build around a tiny palm-sized computer running Windows 11. It was stripped out of its case and wedged into a compact 3D-printed housing only slightly larger than a typical mouse. It has a keyboard of a sort  really its just an array of buttons covering W, A, S, D, and a couple others for playing simple games.\u00a0Amazingly, itll even run Minecraft or Fortnight if you really want to try and squint at that tiny screen.\nHaving a computer with a screen that moves every time you move the mouse isnt ideal. At the same time, its fun to see someone explore a fun (and silly) form factor. Its interesting to see how the project works compared to the original version from a few years ago. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7b50\u4f53\u306bPC\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1", "body": "\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u6c0f\u306f\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u5f62\u72b6\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5c0f\u3055\u306aLCD\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Windows 11\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u624b\u306b\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7b50\u4f53\u306bPC\u3092\u5185\u8535\u3057\u305f\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1", "\u5149\u5b66\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068Intel NUC PC\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7b50\u4f53\u306b\u53ce\u307e\u308b\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u826f\u7248", "\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u5074\u9762\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ec\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "\u5c0f\u578b\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fWindows 11\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc"]}

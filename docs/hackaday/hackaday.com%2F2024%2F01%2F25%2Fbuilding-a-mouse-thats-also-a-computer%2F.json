Now, its possible to fit decent computing power into a board the size of a stick of gum. [Electo] took advantage of this to build an entire computer into a mouse form factor.\n[Electo] had tried this before years ago, and built something pretty sloppy. This time, he wanted to build a version that had an actually-legible screen and fit better in the hand. He whipped up a giant 3D-printed mouse housing, and fitted the sensor board from an optical mouse inside. That was hooked up to an Intel NUC PC that fits inside the housing. A small LCD screen was then installed on a rack system that lets it pop out the front of the mouse. Data entry is via a laser keyboard mounted in the side of the mouse.\nOf course, being based on an Intel NUC means the thing was the size of a couple of phonebooks. Thats not really a mouse. Starting again, he reworked the build around a tiny palm-sized computer running Windows 11. It was stripped out of its case and wedged into a compact 3D-printed housing only slightly larger than a typical mouse. It has a keyboard of a sort  really its just an array of buttons covering W, A, S, D, and a couple others for playing simple games.\u00a0Amazingly, itll even run Minecraft or Fortnight if you really want to try and squint at that tiny screen.\nHaving a computer with a screen that moves every time you move the mouse isnt ideal. At the same time, its fun to see someone explore a fun (and silly) form factor. Its interesting to see how the project works compared to the original version from a few years ago. Video after the break.\n\n"}

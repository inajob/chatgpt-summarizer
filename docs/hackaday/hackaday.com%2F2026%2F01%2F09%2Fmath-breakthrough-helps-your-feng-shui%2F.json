Now, Korean mathematics whiz [Baek Jin-eon] claims to have solved the problem, nearly 60 years later.\nThe trick is, apparently, the shape of the sofa. By 1968, [John Hammerley] introduced a shape that did better than a rectangle, and by 1992, [Joseph Gerver] proposed something shaped like a phone handset, which remains the largest anyone had found, at 2.2195 square meters.\n\nOf course, these are mathematicians, so it isnt solved without a proof. Thats what [Baek Jin-eon] claims to have done: proof that the [Gerver] shape is the largest possible.\nWe wont pretend to understand the math in the paper, but maybe you will. In all fairness, [Baek] worked on it for seven years. We assume deflating an air sofa and then reinflating it on the other side of the bend would be considered cheating.\nWe love applying math to seemingly everyday problems. Like, for instance, just how fast is the post offices eagle? Or even math of a more practical nature."}

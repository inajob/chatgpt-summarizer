But the standard lithium ion battery has a few downsides, namely issues operating at temperature extremes. Lead acid solves some of these problems but has much lower energy density, and if you want to split the difference with your own battery youll need to build your own lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) pack.\n[Well Done Tips] is building this specific type of battery because the lead acid battery in his electric ATV is on the decline. Hes using cylindrical cells that resemble an 18650 battery but are much larger. Beyond the size, though, many of the design principles from building 18650 battery packs are similar, with the exception that these have screw terminals so that bus bars can be easily attached and dont require spot welding.\nWith the pack assembled using 3D printed parts, a battery management system is installed with the balance wires cleverly routed through the prints and attached to the bus bars. The only problem [Well Done Tips] had was not realizing that LiFePO4 batteries voltages settle a bit after being fully charged, which meant that he didnt properly calculate the final voltage of his pack and had to add a cell, bringing his original 15S1P battery up to 16S1P and the correct 54V at full charge.\nLiFePO4 has a few other upsides compared to lithium ion as well, including that it delivers almost full power until its at about 20% charge. Its not quite as energy dense but compared to the lead-acid battery he was using is a huge improvement, and is one of the reasons weve seen them taking over various other EV conversions as well.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u30ea\u30f3\u9178\u5869\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\uff08LiFePO4\uff09\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u30ea\u30f3\u9178\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\uff08LiFePO4\uff09\u306e\u7279\u9577\u3084\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30afATV\u7528\u306b\u81ea\u4f5c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u9244\u30ea\u30f3\u9178\u5869\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\uff08LiFePO4\uff09\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 18650\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u539f\u5247\u3092\u9069\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30afATV\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30cd\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u65b9\u6cd5", "- LiFePO4\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u5145\u96fb\u7279\u6027\u3068\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u306e\u79d8\u8a23"]}

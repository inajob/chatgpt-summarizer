They substitute for a resistor in a circuit and let you quickly flick through a few different values at the twist of a knob. You can still buy them if you know where to look, but [M Caldeira] decided to build his own.\nAt its core, the decade box relies on a number of 11-position rotary switches. Seven are used in this case\u2014covering each decade of resistances, from 1 ohm to 10 ohm and all the way up to 1 megaohm. The 11 positions on each switch allows the selection of a given resistance. For example, position 7 on the 100 ohm switch selects 700 ohms, and adds it to the total resistance of the box.\n[M Caldeira] did a good job of building the basic circuit, as well as assembling it in an attractive, easy-to-use way. It should serve him well on his future audio projects and many others besides. Its a simple thing, but sometimes theres nothing more satisfying than building your own tools.\nWeve seen other neat designs like this in the past, including an SMD version and this neat digital decade box. Video after the break.\n\n"}

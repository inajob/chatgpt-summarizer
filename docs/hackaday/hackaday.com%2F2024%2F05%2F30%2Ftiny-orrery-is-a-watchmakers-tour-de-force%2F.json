And patience  a lot of patience, too.\nAs model solar systems go, this one is exceptionally small. Its maker, [Mike] from Chronova Engineering, says it measures about 20 mm across and qualifies as the smallest orrery around. We cant officiate that claim, but were not going to argue with it either. Its limited to the Sun-Earth-Moon system, and while not as complete as some other models weve seen, its still exquisitely detailed. The gears that keep the Moon rotating 12.4 times around the Earth for each rotation of our home planet around the Sun are tiny, and take an abundance of watchmaking skill to pull off.\nThe video below shows the whole process, which is absolutely entrancing to watch. There are some neat tricks on display, from milling out the arms of the main wheel using a powered tailstock spindle to casting the Sun from resin in a silicone mold. The final model, with the model Earth and Moon spinning around the Sun on delicate brass wheels, is a visual treat.\nWeve seen some interesting stuff from Chronova Engineering lately, including this bimetallic tea timer.\n\n"}

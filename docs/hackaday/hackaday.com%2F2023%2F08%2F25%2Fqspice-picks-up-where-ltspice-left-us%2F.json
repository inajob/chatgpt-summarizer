[Mike] is the developer responsible for LTSpice, which is quite likely the most widely used spice-compatible simulator in the free software domain. When you move away from digital electronics and the comfort of software with its helpful IDEs and toolchains, and dip a wary toe into the murky grey waters of analog or power electronics, LTSpice is your best friend. And, like all best friends, its a bit quirky, but it always has your back. Sadly, LTSpice development seems to have stalled some years ago, but luckily for us [Mike] has been busy on the successor, QSpice, under the watchful eye of Qorvo.\nIt does look in its early stages, but from a useability point of view, its much improved over LTSpice. Performance is excellent (based on this scribes limited testing while mobile.) Gone (thankfully!) is the uncommon verb-noun usage paradigm \u2014 replaced with a more usual cut-n-paste flow. Visually it still kind of looks like LTspice in places, but nicer with a clear and uncluttered design that gets straight to the point. Internally, the simulation engine has improved in speed and accuracy, as well as adding native support for modern semiconductor types, such as wide bandgap materials like SiC. Noted is that this updated software has a particular emphasis on power integrity and noise analysis, which are sticky problems that have a big impact on modern high-power systems.\n\nParticularly of interest is native support for behavioral modeling using Verilog and C++, making QSpice a true mixed-mode simulator. This will help speed up many classes of non-trivial simulation, both in terms of simulation time and development time. We really do need to stress that this is a major update on LTSpice, and we will definitely be playing with it a lot in the coming months.\nAcquiring a download link requires email details to be sent via this web form, but this just takes you here. Just saying :) Now all we need is a model converter to import LTSpice schematic/symbol files and well be very happy.\nWe cover simulation tools and tutorials a fair bit because these are important subjects. Heres a little thing about LTSpice. Then there is the excellent QUCS and related QUCS studio. Finally, lets show a Python-based simulator that could be helpful in some situations.\nvia eetimes.", "title": "LTSpice\u306e\u5f8c\u7d99\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3001QSpice\u306e\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "[Mike Engelhardt] is developing a successor to LTSpice called QSpice, which improves usability and performance.

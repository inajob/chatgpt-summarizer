With just access to a printer, a few cheap-as-chips servo motors, an Arduino, and some nuts and bolts, you could be hacking together robot walkers within a few hours of starting!\nBolt Bots is very simple to understand, with all the mechanics and wiring out there in the breeze, but strictly for indoor use we reckon. If you want to add remote control to your application, then drop in one of the ubiquitous nRF24L01 boards and build yourself a copy of the remote control [saul] handily provides in this other project.\nThere really isnt a great deal we can say about this, as its essentially a build kit with quite a few configuration options, and you just have to build with it and see whats possible. We expect the number of parts to proliferate over time giving even more options. So far [saul] demonstrates a few flavors of walkers, a rudimentary robot arm, and even a hanging drawbot.\nThe bolt hardware can be found in this GitHub repo, and the remote control code in this second one.\nServo-based designs are sometimes sneered at due to their dubious accuracy and repeatability, but with a little of effort, this can be vastly improved upon. Also, multi-legged walkers need multiple servos and controllers to drive em. Or do they?\n\n\n\nThe HackadayPrize 2023 is Sponsored by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

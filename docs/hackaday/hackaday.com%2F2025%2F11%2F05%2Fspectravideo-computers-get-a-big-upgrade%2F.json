Their computers still have a fanbase of users and modders. Now, as demonstrated by [electricadventures], you can actually upgrade your ancient Spectravideo machine with some modern hardware.\nThe upgrade in question is the SVI-38 PicoExpander from [fitch]. Its based on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, and is built to work with the Spectravideo 318 and 328 machines. If youre running a 328, it will offer a full 96kB of additional RAM, while if youre running a 318, it will add 144 kB more RAM and effectively push the device up to 328 spec. Its also capable of emulating a pair of disk drives or a cassette drive, with saving and loading images possible over Wi-Fi.\nIts worth noting, though, that the PicoExpander pushes the Pico 2W well beyond design limits, overclocking it to 300 MHz (versus the original 150 MHz clock speed). The makers note it is bleeding edge hardware and that it may not last as long as the Spectravideo machines themselves.\nDesign files are available on Github if you want to spin up your own PicoExpander, or you can just order an assembled version. Weve seen a lot of other neat retrocomputer upgrades built around modern hardware, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]", "title": "\u300c\u53e4\u3044Spectravideo\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308bPicoExpander\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "body": "Spectravideo\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092Raspberry Pi Pico\u3067\u5f37\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u8ffd\u52a0RAM\u3084\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u53e4\u3044Spectravideo\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u5316\u3059\u308bPicoExpander\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u300d", "\u300cRaspberry Pi Pico\u3067Spectravideo\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300cSpectravideo\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5411\u3051\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u300d", "\u300cPicoExpander\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u5316\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Spectravideo\u306eRAM\u5897\u8a2d\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u62e1\u5f35\u300d"]}

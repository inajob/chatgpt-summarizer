Researchers have now found a strong, lightweight nanostructured carbon. [via BGR]\nUsing a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO) algorithm trained on finite element analysis (FEA) datasets to identify the best candidate nanostructures, the researchers then brought the theoretical material to life with 2 photon polymerization (2PP) photolithography. The resulting carbon nanolattices achieve the compressive strength of carbon steels (180\u2013360 MPa) with the density of Styrofoam (125\u2013215 kg m\u22123) which exceeds the specific strengths of equivalent low-density materials by over an order of magnitude.\nWhile you probably shouldnt start getting investors for your space elevator startup just yet, lighter materials like this are promising for a lot of applications, most notably more conventional aviation where fuel (or energy) prices are a big constraint on operations. As with any lab results, more work is needed until we see this in the real world, but it is nice to know that superalloys and composites arent the end of the road for strong and lightweight materials.\nWeve seen AI help identify battery materials already and this seems to be one avenue where generative AI isnt just about making embarrassing photos or making us less intelligent.", "title": "- \u30ca\u30ce\u69cb\u9020\u30e1\u30bf\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\uff1a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u7d20\u6750", "body": "\u30ca\u30ce\u69cb\u9020\u30e1\u30bf\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\u8efd\u91cf\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u5f37\u5ea6\u3068\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3092\u4e21\u7acb\u3002\u5b9f\u7528\u5316\u306b\u306f\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ca\u30ce\u69cb\u9020\u30e1\u30bf\u30de\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\uff1a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\u514b\u670d\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u7d20\u6750", "- \u8efd\u91cf\u304b\u3064\u5f37\u976d\u306a\u30ca\u30ce\u69cb\u9020\u70ad\u7d20\u306e\u8a95\u751f", "- \u591a\u76ee\u7684\u30d9\u30a4\u30b8\u30a2\u30f3\u6700\u9069\u5316\u3067\u6750\u6599\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5019\u88dc\u3092\u767a\u898b", "- \u71c3\u6599\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u822a\u7a7a\u6750\u6599\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u751f\u6210AI\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3092\u9042\u3052\u308b\uff1a\u30ca\u30ce\u6750\u6599\u306e\u7279\u5b9a\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5f79\u5272"]}

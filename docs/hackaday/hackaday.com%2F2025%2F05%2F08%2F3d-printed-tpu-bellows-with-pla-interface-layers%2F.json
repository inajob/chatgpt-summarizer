Case in point the TPU-based bellows that the [Functional Part Friday] channel on YouTube recently demonstrated.\nThe idea is quite straightforward: you print TPU and PLA in alternating layers, making sure that the TPU is connected to its previous layer in an alternating fashion. After printing, you peel the PLA and TPU apart, remove the PLA layers and presto, you got yourself bellows.\nThere were some issues along the way, of course. Case in point the differences between TPU from different brands (Sainsmart, Sunlu) that caused some headaches, and most of all the incompatibility between the Bambu Lab AMS and TPU that led to incredibly brittle TPU prints. This required bypassing the feed mechanism in the AMS, which subsequently went down a rabbit hole of preventing the PTFE tube from getting sucked into the AMS. Being able to print TPU  PLA at the same time also requires a printer with two independent extruders like the\u00a0Bambu Lab H2D used here, as both materials do not mix in any way. Great news for H2D and IDEX printer owners, of course.\nAs for practical applications for bellows, beyond printing your own 1900s-era camera, accordion or hand air bellows, you can also create lathe way covers and so on.\n\n", "title": "- TPU\u3068PLA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30d9\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": " TPU\u3068PLA\u3092\u4ea4\u4e92\u306b\u5370\u5237\u3057\u3001\u30d9\u30ebows\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3084\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306b\u554f\u984c\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["- TPU\u3068PLA\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5370\u5237\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30d9\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u7269\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u4e92\u63db\u6027\u306e\u554f\u984c\uff1a\u7570\u306a\u308bTPU\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "- \u4e8c\u982d\u306e\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fTPU-PLA\u306e\u540c\u6642\u5370\u5237", "- \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3084\u697d\u5668\u304c\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\uff01\u30d9\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u5b9f\u7528\u5fdc\u7528"]}

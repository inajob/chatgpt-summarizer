This year though, many of them couldnt, because the countrys NATS air traffic system went down and stranded many to grumble in the heat of a crowded terminal. At the time it was blamed on faulty flight data, but news now emerges that the data which brought down an entire countrys air traffic control may have not been faulty at all.\nArmed with the official incident report and publicly available flight data, Internet sleuths theorize that the trouble was due to one particular flight: French Bee flight 731 from Los Angeles to Paris. The flight itself was unremarkable, but the data which sent the NATS computers into a tailspin came from two of its waypoints  Devils Lake Wisconsin and Deauville Normandy  having the same DVL identifier. Given the vast distance between the two points, the system believed it was looking at a faulty route, and refused to process it. A backup system automatically stepped in to try and reconcile the data, but it made the same determination as the primary software, so the whole system apparently ground to a halt.\nIts important to note that there was nothing wrong with the flight plan entered in by the French Bee pilots, and that early stories blaming faulty data were themselves at fault. However we are guessing that air traffic software developers worldwide are currently scrambling to check their code for this particular bug. Were fortunate indeed that safety wasnt compromised and only inconvenience was the major outcome.\nAir traffic control doesnt feature here too often, but weve previously looked at a much earlier system.\nHeader image: John Evans, CC BY-SA 2.0.", "title": "\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u30db\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba\u30f3\u306b\u7a7a\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u8d77\u304d\u305f", "body": "8\u6708\u672b\u306e\u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9\u306e\u9280\u884c\u4f11\u65e5\u306f\u56fd\u6c11\u7684\u306a\u4f11\u65e5\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u304c\u30d3\u30fc\u30c1\u306b\u5411\u304b\u3046\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u5e74\u306f\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u969c\u5bb3\u3067\u8db3\u6b62\u3081\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u554f\u984c\u306f\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u8aa4\u308a\u3060\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u306f1\u3064\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3067\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u505c\u6b62\u3057\u305f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u4ed6\u306e\u822a\u7a7a\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u3082\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u958b\u767a\u8005\u305f\u3061\u306f\u4eca\u614c\u3066\u3066\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002", "titles": ["\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u30db\u30ea\u30c7\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc\u30ba\u30f3\u306b\u7a7a\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u8d77\u304d\u305f", "NATS\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u306e\u969c\u5bb3\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u304c\u822a\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u3092\u6df7\u4e71\u3055\u305b\u305f", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u7a7a\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u305f", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u304c\u4e0d\u4fbf\u306a\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u9665\u3063\u305f"]}

Now [Bea Thurman] had to put it to use.\u00a0If the Greengate DS:3 card was rare,\u00a0 the keyboard was nearly impossible to find. After a long search, [Bea] bought one all the way from Iceland.\u00a0 The card of course came courtesy of [Eric].\u00a0\nIt was time to connect the two together.\u00a0 But there was a problem  a big problem. The GreenGate has a DB-25 connected via a ribbon cable to the boards 210 connector. The keyboard that shipped with those cards would plug right in.\u00a0 Unfortunately, [Bea\u2019s] keyboard had a DIP-40 IDC connector crimped on its ribbon cable.\u00a0 What\u2019s more the connectors for the sustain and volume pedals were marked, but never drilled out. The GreenGate silk screen was still there though.\u00a0\nMaybe it was a prototype or some sort of modified hardware. Either way, the 40-pin DIP connector had to go if the keyboard ever were to work with the card. What followed were a few hours of careful wire tracing\u00a0\n\nTracing out pins is always a pain.\u00a0 To make it worse, the only DB-25 connector [Bea] had on hand was an Insulation Displacement Connector (IDC). It\u2019s the right part to use for the ribbon cable attached to the keyboard, but not what you\u2019d want to use to test pinouts. These connectors are generally crimped once.\nThe GreenGate keyboard and foot pedals are matrix scanned  much like a standard alphanumeric keyboard. The keyboard also needed some internal cleanup after 40 years. Like many \u2018boards of the day, it used small spring wires that made contact with a common bar. After some painstaking debugging, working directly with [Eric] on video chat, [Bea] had the system working.\u00a0 Now came the fun part  using the keyboard to make music.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Greengate hardware is impressive, but the software is stunning. [Bea] got in touch with [Colin Holgate], who wrote it. Hes also the gate in Greengate. With [Colins] software, Waveforms can be edited in an oscilloscope view, much like one would find in a modern DAW. The software even includes a pattern editor, which can be used for arpeggios.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe GreenGate has 4 notes of polyphony, is multitimbral, and can layer multiple samples across the keyboard. Considering this is all handled on an Apple II+ with a green screen monitor for a UI, impressive is an understatement.\n[Bea] gives us a great walkthrough using the system. She starts by sampling audio from a cassette. With the audio in memory, she uses this to build a simple song. The entire setup made an appearance at VCF MidWest, so if you saw it in person let us know in the comments!\n"}

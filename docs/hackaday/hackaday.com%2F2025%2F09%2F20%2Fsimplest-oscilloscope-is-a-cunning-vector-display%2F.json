[mircemk]s guide How to make Simplest ever Oscilloscope Clock falls into that category. Its that word, simplest. Certainly, this is an oscilloscope clock, and a nice one. But is it simple?\nTheres a nice oscilloscope circuit with a cute 2 5LO38I CRT and EF80 tubes for horizontal and vertical deflection that wed say is pretty simple. (Its based on an earlier DIY oscilloscope project [mircemk] did.) The bill of materials is remarkably sparse but its modules that do it. One entry is a DC-DC step up supply to get the needed HV. Another is a LM317 to get 6.3 V to heat the tubes. The modules make for a very simple BOM, but on another level, theres quite a bit of complex engineering in those little modules.\nWhen we get to the clock part of the oscilloscope clock, that quandary goes into overdrive. Theres only one line on the BOM, so thats very simple. On the other hand, its an ESP32. Depending on your perspective, thats not simple at all. Its a microcomputer, or at least something that can play at emulating one.\nOh, in the ways that matter to a maker  parts count, time, and effort, this oscilloscope clock is very simple. The fact that its actually a vector display for a powerful little micro just adds to the versatility of the build. We absolutely love it, to be honest. Still, the idea that you can have millions of transistors in a simple project  never mind the simplest ever  well, it just seems weird on some level when you think about it.\nIt all comes back to what counts as simple. If were taking lines on a BOM, arguably this would be even simpler if you used an existing oscilloscope.\u00a0"}

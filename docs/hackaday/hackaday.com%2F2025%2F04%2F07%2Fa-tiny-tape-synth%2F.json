A real Melotron in working order will set you back a bit, but its possible to play with the idea using much more attainable hardware. [Decurus] has made a simple tape based synth using a cassette deck.\nIt uses a loop of cassette tape, and varies the pitch by changing the speed of the cassette motor. Theres an RP2040 and a motor controller, which can take a MIDI signal and use it to drive the motor. Were sorry to see that theres no recording of the result, but its described as a drone.\nPart of this project is a 3D printed tape loop holder to fit a cassette mechanism. We wont go as far as to call it a cassette in itself, instead its a sort of tape loop frame. We can see that it might be an interesting component for other tape loop experimenters, now that cassettes themselves are no longer ubiquitous. This certainly isnt the first tape pitch synth weve seen."}

But if theres one place where analog scopes still shine, its anywhere you need X-Y mode. Digitally sampling the inputs and mapping them on the screen as discrete points just isnt the same as steering an electron beam around a CRT, making X-Y mode work on digital scopes  at least the affordable ones  somewhat lacking.\nThankfully, nobody told [Mark Hughes] that his digital scope would make a lousy X-Y display, so he just plunged ahead and figured out how to make it work anyway. The results are actually pretty good, but it took some doing. His setup begins with OsciStudio, an application built to take 3D shapes and animations and turn them into oscilloscope music. The output from that is piped to a USB sound card; [Mark] used a PreSonus Studio 26c, an adapter with DC-coupled inputs, which he found to be critical to getting good images. Also important was a USB isolator and good-quality cables, which greatly reduced jitter and made the image much more stable.\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying the image was as easy as connecting the left and right outputs from the sound card to the two scope inputs  [Mark] used a Keysight EDUX1052G  and setting it to X-Y mode. It took a fair amount of fiddling to get as far as he did, but we think the results speak for themselves. As for the sounds made by these images, he says its a bit like a hung sound card when a computer blue-screens. So, yeah  not exactly musical, but still an interesting way to have some fun with your digital scope."}

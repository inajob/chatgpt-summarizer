Last year\u2019s CH32 Fireplace brought an animated LED fire to life with CH32V003 microcontrollers.\nThis year, they\u2019ve gone a step further with the North Pole Circuit, a holiday project that combines magnetic propulsion, festive decorations, and a bit of engineering flair. Inspired by a miniature speedway based on Friedrich Gauss findings, the North Pole Circuit includes sleighs and reindeer that glide along a custom PCB track, a glowing village with flickering lights, and a buzzer to play Christmas tunes.\nThe propulsion system works using the Lorentz force, where vertical magnets interact with PCB traces to produce motion. A two-phase design, similar to a stepper motor, ensures smooth operation, while guard rails maintain stability on curves. A separate CH32V003 handles lighting and synchronized jingles, creating a cohesive festive display. As we mentioned in the article on their last years creation, going from a one-off to a full batch will make one rethink the joy of repetitive production. Consider the recipients of these tiny christmas cards quite the lucky ones. We deem this little gift a keeper to put on display when Christmas rolls around again.\nThis annual tradition highlights the Crew\u2019s knack for combining fun and engineering.

Certainly, users value speed. But some value quality even more highly, and if gaining quality means giving up speed, then so be it. Thats more or less how things stood for a while, but all things change.\nThe landscape of filament-based 3D printing over the past year or so has made one thing clear: the markets gotten a taste of speed, and what was once the domain of enthusiasts installing and configuring custom firmware is now a baseline people will increasingly expect. After all, who doesnt want faster prints if one doesnt have to sacrifice quality in the process?\nSpeed vs. Quality: No Longer a Tradeoff\nHistorically, any meaningful increase in printing speed risked compromising quality. Increasing print speed can introduce artifacts like ringing\u00a0or ghosting, as well as other issues. Printing faster can also highlight mechanical limitations or shortcomings that may not have been a problem at lower speeds. These issues cant all be resolved by tightening some screws or following a calibration process.\nThe usual way to get into higher speed printing has been to install something like Klipper, and put the necessary work into configuring and calibrating for best results. Not everyone who prints wishes to go this route. In 3D printing there are always those more interested in the end result than in pushing the limits of the machine itself. For those folks, the benefits of speedy printing have generally come at too high a cost.\nThats no longer the case. One can now buy a printer that effectively self-calibrates, offers noticeably increased printing speeds over any earlier style machines, and does it at a reasonable price.\n\nFast, Right Out of the Box\nPrinter manufacturers like Bambu Lab have made reliable high-speed printing something thats available from a printer right off the shelf. Since then, other manufacturers have focused more on features that bring speed increases like input shaping and pressure advance. One no longer has to choose between quality and speed, nor does one need to install and configure custom firmware to get the benefits.\nBambu Lab didnt invent any of these features, but they were the first major player to bring them out of the enthusiast niche and into the limelight. Prior to Bambu Lab bringing these features to the mass market, 3D printer designs spent years without really changing much. Certainly, machines gained features and refinements, but the basic designs and capabilities went broadly unchanged.\nThen a new machine comes along that not only has folks printing within twenty minutes of opening the box, but self-calibrates and cranks out a Benchy boat in a fraction of the usual time.\nBy the end of 2023 it was clear that reliable speed that does not seriously compromise print quality had arrived, and the 3D printing scene has been very, very receptive to the idea.\nWhy Hasnt This Happened Earlier?\nA 3D printer has many parts that must work together, and only when all these are in harmony can a print be both fast and of reliable quality. That means speed isnt just about running motors faster; its about ensuring everything works in harmony as well. With small and slow machines, this is far less difficult to do. As machines get larger and faster, the problem gets rapidly more complex and the margins for error get smaller.\nAny speed increase has an impact on the physics of all of the other moving (and melty) parts that make up a printer. As its sometimes said in physics, everything is a spring. Motors do not start and stop instantly, toolheads have mass and inertia, melted plastic doesnt stop or start flowing instantly in perfect volumes. The faster everything moves and the larger the printer is, the harder the job becomes and the more obvious it is when everything isnt as it should be.\nMaking a printer fast and reliable means minimizing some of those effects and compensating for the others, which is not a trivial task. And with the need for precise tuning comes the need for regular calibration to keep things in line. Effective self-calibration becomes an attractive complement to higher print speeds.\nWhat Will Be Next?\nFor a good while, printers got improvements and new features but fundamentally didnt change very much. Now that printers have hit the market that show speed doesnt have to sacrifice quality, the response is clear: faster is better.\nIt wont be long before what we now consider fast becomes normal expectation for 3D printers. Once that happens, what do you think will be the next frontier? What features are currently the domain of cutting-edge DIY enthusiasts that you believe will be the next big thing? Non-planar printing, perhaps? Let us know in the comments."}

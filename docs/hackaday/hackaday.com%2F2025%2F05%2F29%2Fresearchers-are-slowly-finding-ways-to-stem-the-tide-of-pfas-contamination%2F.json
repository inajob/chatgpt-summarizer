Theyre bad for us, and we know it, but theyve been leeching into the environment for decades, often as a result of military or industrial activity. Whats worse is that these contaminants just dont seem to break down\u2014they stick around in the environment causing harm on an ongoing basis.\nNow, researchers are finally cracking the code on how to deal with these notoriously stubborn molecules. It wont be easy, but theres finally some hope in the fight against the bad stuff that doesnt just wash away.\n\nDo You Really Want To Live Forever?\nPFAS chemicals have been found contaminating tapwater supplies across the United States, and the world.

These substances earned their nickname from The Washington Post in 2018, and for good reason. These synthetic compounds feature carbon-fluorine bonds. These are some of the strongest chemical bonds found in nature and are very hard to break. This molecular stubbornness is actually a key feature of these chemicals, making them incredibly useful for things like firefighting foams or non-stick cookware\u2014indeed, the remarkably unreactive Teflon was one of the first PFAS materials to come to prominence. However, this very feature\u00a0 also means they accumulate in the environment and in our bodies rather than breaking down naturally.\nIn practical terms, the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond means that PFAS chemicals are remarkably stable, and can easily resist high temperatures and chemical attack. Thus, they can persist in the environment for thousands of years, contaminating water supplies, accumulating in food chains, and most crucially\u2014causing health issues. Research is ongoing, but PFAS chemicals have already been implicated in potentially causing everything from cancers to hormone disruption and liver damage.\nStop The Spread\nFirefighting foams are one of the prime sources of PFAS contamination. The problem is often at its worst in areas where these foams are used regularly, such as military airfields.

Cleaning up existing contamination is of prime importance, particularly in areas where humans still live and work. Removing these chemicals in drinking water supplies remains challenging, but possible. The techniques are well understood, typically requiring the use of reverse osmosis techniques or lots of activated carbon. But what about all the contaminated human-built infrastructure, like military airfields and the like? Many of these concrete and tarmac structures have been soaking in PFAS chemicals for decades, and pose a continued risk of these substnaces leaking into the environment.\nAustralian firm AmbioLock has gone with an unconventional approach. Rather than trying to remove PFAS from contaminated concrete at airports and fire training grounds, theyve developed a sealant to lock the chemicals in place. The idea is that the dangerous chemicals can be sealed to the engineered materials so they dont leach into the environment or harm anyone using the infrastructure on the regular.\u00a0The company has developed a silicate-based sealant called AmbioSeal, which penetrates the pores of concrete structures to create an impermeable barrier. In testing, the sealant achieved a 99.2% reduction in PFAS leaching from treated materials. The idea is that built infrastructure can be treated to seal PFAS contamination in place, such that the facilities can still be used safely while minimizing further risk from these deletrious chemicals.\nThe products could yet find grand markets with governments and private operators around the world. There are a great many PFAS contamination sites that are badly in need of remediation. However, its still an imperfect measure\u2014ideally, we wouldnt be spraying these nasty chemicals all over the place to begin with.\nUltimate Destruction\nGovernment and industry are also keen to find ways to limit or avoid future potential releases, too. Enter a team of researchers from CSIRO and Colorado State University. Using computer simulations rooted in quantum mechanics, they modeled exactly what happens to PFAS molecules during pyrometallurgy. The scenario in question concerned lithium-ion battery recycling via pyrometallurgy\u2014the process of incinerating battery materials to recover the metals inside. The researchers eager to determine what peak incinerator temperatures were necessary to destroy any PFAS component of the recyclable battery material, thus ensuring that it would not be released into the environment during the recycling procedure.\nThere is an increasing push to begin mass battery recycling of lithium-ion cells. Researchers at Colorado State and CSIRO have been working to determine how best to pursue that goal while avoiding the release of harmful PFAS chemicals into the atmosphere.

At lower temperatures (200 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C), PFAS compounds simply vaporize and enter the gas phase, becoming mobile but otherwise remaining stable. The team found that higher temperatures were needed to get the tough C-F bonds to finally surrender and break apart completely. Modelling for an incinerators short two-second retention time for gases, the team determined a temperature of 950 \u00b0C was necessary to attain quick destruction. \u201cWe identified the intermediate compounds formed, the key barriers in the process, and determined the required temperatures and times to fully break down these chemicals,\u201d noted Dr Jens Blotevogel, a CSIRO researcher involved with the project.\nWhile the research focused on a specific recycling case, it has broader implications. The modelling may guide future work for other scenarios where its desirable to create a recycling process or similar in which PFAS materials will be destroyed rather than emitted to the environment. There is a particularly strong focus on how the world will recycle the masses of batteries now floating around the economy, so it will have direct benefits in limiting PFAS emissions in that regard, too.\nThese breakthroughs represent real progress, but the challenge now is implementation. Governments, industries, and relevant authorities will need to invest in research and techniques like these to develop cost-effective solutions for the thousands of PFAS-emitting and PFAS-contaminated sites worldwide. PFAS destruction represents one of the major mainstream environmental challenges today. As these researchers have shown, with the right analysis and some clever chemistry, forever doesnt necessarily have to mean forever.", "title": "\u6c38\u9060\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8ceaPFAS\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u554f\u984c\u3078\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "body": "PFAS\u306f\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u5206\u89e3\u3055\u308c\u305a\u74b0\u5883\u3084\u5065\u5eb7\u306b\u60aa\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u9664\u53bb\u3084\u51e6\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u6a21\u7d22\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u6c38\u9060\u306e\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8ceaPFAS\uff1a\u74b0\u5883\u554f\u984c\u3078\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1", "PFAS\u6c5a\u67d3\u306e\u73fe\u72b6\u3068\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6d44\u5316\u6cd5", "\u5bc6\u9589\u578b\u30b7\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067PFAS\u3092\u5c01\u3058\u8fbc\u3081\u308b\uff1a\u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30eb\u3068PFAS\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u7834\u58ca\uff1a\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u5c55\u958b", "\u74b0\u5883\u79d1\u5b66\u306e\u9032\u5c55\uff1aPFAS\u3078\u306e\u653b\u6483\u306b\u6311\u3080\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853"]}

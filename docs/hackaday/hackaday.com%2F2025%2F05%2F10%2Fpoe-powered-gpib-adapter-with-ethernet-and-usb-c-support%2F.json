Here [Chris]s Ethernet-GPIB adapter provides an easy solution, with both Power over Ethernet (PoE) and USB-C power options. Although commercial adapters already exist, these are rather pricey at ~$500.\nFeatures of this adapter include a BOM total of $50, with power provided either via PoE (802.3af) or USB-C (5V-only). The MCU is an ATmega4809 with the Ethernet side using a Wiznet W5500 SPI Ethernet controller. There is also a serial interface (provided by a CH340X USB-UART adapter), with the firmware based on the AR488 project.\nThe adapter supports both the VXI-11.2 and Prologix protocols, though not at the same time (due to ROM size limitations). All design documents are available via the GitHub repository, with the author also selling assembled adapters and providing support primarily via the EEVBlog forums.", "title": "- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bEthernet-GPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306aEthernet-GPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002PoE\u3068USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002$50\u306e\u90e8\u54c1\u8cbb\u3067\u3001\u5546\u7528\u54c1\u306e500\u30c9\u30eb\u306b\u5bfe\u6297\u3002", "titles": ["- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308bEthernet-GPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30e9\u30dc\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u7c21\u7d20\u5316\u3059\u308bEthernet\u63a5\u7d9a\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8", "- PoE\u3068USB-C\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eGPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u89e3\u8aac", "- ATmega4809\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5cEthernet-GPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u7279\u5fb4", "- GitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\uff01DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5411\u3051GPIB\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30bf\u306e\u5b8c\u5168\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

Was it Korean? Sort of. Was it faster than a calculator? Sort of. [Chris Staecker] offers a great look at Chisanbop, not just how to do it, but also how it became such a significant\u00a0cultural phenomenon. Take a look at the video below. Long, but worth it.\nTechnically, the idea is fairly simple. Your right-hand thumb is worth 5, and each finger is worth 1. So to identify 8, you hold down your thumb and the first three digits. The left hand has the same arrangement, but everything is worth ten times the right hand, so the thumb is 50, and each digit is worth 10.\nWith a little work, it is easy to count and add using this method. Subtraction is just the reverse. As you might expect, multiplication is just repeated addition. But the real story here isnt how to do Chisanbop. It is more the story of how a Korean immigrants system went viral decades before the advent of social media.\nYou can argue that this is a shortcut that hurts math understanding. Or, you could argue the reverse. However, the truth is that this was around the time the calculator became widely available. Math education would shift from focusing on getting the right answer to understanding the underlying concepts. In a world where adding ten 6-digit numbers is easy with a $5 device, being able to do it with your fingers isnt necessarily a valuable skill.\nIf you enjoy unconventional math methods, you may appreciate peasant multiplication.\n\n", "title": "- \u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u306e\u6307\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8a08\u7b97\u6cd5\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u6307\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u97d3\u56fd\u306e\u8a08\u7b97\u6cd5\u300c\u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30d7\u300d\u306e\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u306e\u6307\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8a08\u7b97\u6cd5\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b74\u53f2", "- \u6307\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6570\u3048\u65b9\uff1a\u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u57fa\u672c", "- \u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7 vs \u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\uff1a\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u5909\u5316", "- \u975e\u4f1d\u7d71\u7684\u306a\u6570\u5b66\u6cd5\uff1a\u30c1\u30b5\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5\u3068\u5229\u70b9"]}

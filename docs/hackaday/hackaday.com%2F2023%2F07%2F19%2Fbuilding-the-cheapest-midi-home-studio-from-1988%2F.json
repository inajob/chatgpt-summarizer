Back in the 1980s, though, this was still a nascent field, with new gear changing the game for musicians. In his latest video, [cTrix] puts together a guide to building a budget MIDI home studio like its 1988.\nThe original Atari ST is the star of the show, which sold for around \u00a3300 back then. Unlike most contemporary computers, it came with MIDI ports built-in, and it quickly became a popular platform for music sequencing and controlling external synth hardware. It was often spotted in posh studios being used by big-time musicians, but [cTrix] wanted to look at how it was used by more humble users.\nWhile the Atari ST could output some passable chiptunes, it was most powerful when paired with off-board gear. Industry magazines would readily talk up DIY setups worth thousands, but [cTrix] aimed for a budget in the low hundreds. In 1988, that might get you something like the 16-channel Yamaha PSS-580, which rocked full MIDI support and a ton of sounds and drumkits built in. It ran an OPL soundchip, and could play multiple instruments at once under MIDI control from software like Dr. Ts MIDI Recording Studio.\nOf course, if youve ever played a keyboard like the PSS-580, youll have noted that the sound output can be more than a little chintzy. A cheap way to level up was to get yourself something like the Roland MT-32, which rocked a far higher-quality sound module. Everything from slap bass to solid electric pianos could be blasted out from the Roland, which also included a decent reverb unit, too. [cTrix] also dives into other budget heroes, like the rich and expansive Kawai K1 and the Yamaha EMT-10.\nIf you want to make music like its 1988 and youre hunting for your first gold record, youll learn a lot here. We cant wait for Part 2, that explores the next level of sophistication in this era. His previous lessons on how to make 90s dance bangers on the Amiga are a treat, too.\n\n", "title": "1988\u5e74\u306e\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eMIDI\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9032\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308a\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u304c\u5e83\u307e\u3063\u305f\u8a71\u3002\u4e88\u7b97300\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u306eAtari ST\u308416\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30e4\u30de\u30cfPSS-580\u304c\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3001\u9375\u76e4\u306e\u97f3\u8cea\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u306f\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9MT-32\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3063\u305f\u3002\u6b21\u56de\u306f\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u9032\u5316\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002", "titles": ["1988\u5e74\u306e\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eMIDI\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "Atari ST\u3068\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3067\u4f5c\u308b1988\u5e74\u306e\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af", "\u4f4e\u4e88\u7b97\u3067\u3082\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u97f3\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e1988\u5e74\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9MT-32\u3068\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3067\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u30801988\u5e74\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa", "1988\u5e74\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

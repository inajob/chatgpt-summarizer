Computers like the IBM S/360 or 3090 are hard to find, transport, and operate, so you dont see many retrocomputer enthusiasts with an S/370 in their garages. Weve known for a while that the Hercules emulators would let you run virtual copies of these old mainframes, but every time weve looked at setting any up, it winds up being more work than we wanted to spend. Enter [Ernie] of [ErnieTechs Little Mainframes]. Hes started a channel to show you how to build your own mainframe  emulated, of course.\nOne problem with the mainframe environment is that there are a bunch of operating system-like things like MVS, VM/CMS, and TSO. There were even custom systems like MUSIC/SP, which he shows in the video below.\n\nOn top of that, you have to learn a lot of new software. Scripting? Rexx. Editing? Several choices, but none you are likely to know about if you havent used a mainframe before. Programming languages? You can find C sometimes, but it might not be a modern dialect. You might have more luck with FORTRAN or COBOL.\nIn addition, IBM has specific terms for things we dont use in the rest of the world. Boot? IPL (initial program load). Disk? DASD. Security? RACF.\nSo far, [Ernie] only has an overview and a short demo. If you cant wait,\u00a0 cruise over to the Hercules page and see how far you can get. You may decide to wait for [Ernies] next video.\nIf you want to shortcut, there are entire environments in Docker that can be handy. If your IBM nostalgia runs to the smaller System/3, AS/400, or POWER systems, someone already has something ready for you to use.\n", "title": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u4eee\u60f3\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u4eee\u60f3\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff1aHercules\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304dIBM\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u9580", "Docker\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308bIBM\u306e\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01Ernie\u306e\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u8b1b\u5ea7"]}

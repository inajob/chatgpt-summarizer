This is true for the challenge of proving that cascading stylesheets are Turing-complete, or that you dont need all those fancy ISA bits of an ARM processors when you already got the LDM and STM commands in the 32-bit ISA. What originally started off as a bit of a running gag in a group of developers led to [Kellan Clark] implementing a Turing-complete computer and a functioning interpreter using nothing but these two opcodes.\nAdding some Brainf**k to your ARM, inside your GBA.\nThese two opcodes essentially allow the storing or reading of data into memory from any combination of the 16 general-purpose registers (GPRs). This makes them both extremely versatile and also extremely open to abuse like in this example. For a straightforward implementation that could prove the concept, [Kellan] decided to pick one of everyones favorite esoteric programming languages: Brainf**k (descrambling algorithm: s/s/u), creating the charmingly titled Armf**k that allows anyone to write BF programs for any suitable ARM processor, like the ARM7TDMI in the Game Boy Advance that [Kellan] targeted.\nAs a proof of concept its unquestioningly intriguing, and a great example of how the most powerful parts of any ISA are those that move data around. After all, as anyone who writes ASM and C knows, computers are just machines that can copy bytes around really fast to make stuff happen. Mind-blowing examples like these serve to illustrate that point quite well.\nTip kindly provided by [eeucalyptus].", "title": "\u300cARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067Brainf**k\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "body": "ARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3067Turing\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5b9f\u88c5\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Brainf**k\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300cARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067Brainf**k\u3092\u5b9f\u884c\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c16\u500b\u306eGPR\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001ARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u6f14\u7b97\u3092\u884c\u3046\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u306e\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u300d", "\u300cARMf**k\uff1a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308bBrainf**k\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d7\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u300d", "\u300c\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u79fb\u52d5\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aISA\u306e\u771f\u306e\u529b\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5b9a\u7fa9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d7\u30ea\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff1aARM\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u5b8c\u5168\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5\u300d"]}

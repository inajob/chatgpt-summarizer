But 3D printing isnt the only way to build polymer structures, as [Riley] shows us with this fascinating attempt to create electrospun heart valves.\nNow, you may never have heard of electrospinning, but well venture a guess that as soon as you see what it entails, youll have a Why didnt I think of that? moment. As [Riley] explains, electrospinning uses an electric field to build structures from fine threads of liquid polymer solution  he uses polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polyester weve seen used in other medical applications, which he dissolves in acetone. He loads it into a syringe, attaches the positive terminal of a high-voltage power supply to the hypodermic needle, and the negative terminal to a sheet of aluminum foil. The charge turns the PCL droplets into fine threads that accumulate on the foil; once the solvent flashes off, whats left is a gossamer layer of non-woven plastic fabric.\nTo explore the uses of this material, [Riley] chose to make an artificial heart valve. This required a 3D-printed framework with three prongs, painted with conductive paint. He tried a few variations on the design before settling on a two-piece armature affixed to a rotating shaft. The PCL accumulates on the form, creating a one-piece structure that can be gingerly slipped off thanks to a little silicon grease used as a release agent.\nThe results are pretty impressive. The structure bears a strong resemblance to an artificial tricuspid heart valve, with three delicate leaves suspended between the upright prongs. Its just a proof of concept, of course, but its a great demonstration of the potential of electrospinning, as well as an eye-opening look at what else additive manufacturing has to offer.\n\n", "title": "\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u96fb\u754c\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u5408\u6210\u7e4a\u7dad\u3092\u9020\u308b\u300c\u96fb\u6c17\u7d21\u7cf8\u6cd5\u300d\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5f01\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u30023D\u5370\u5237\u3068\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3066\u6210\u529f\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u6027\u3092\u793a\u3059\u5b9f\u9a13\u3002", "titles": ["\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u88fd\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u96fb\u754c\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u5fc3\u81d3\u5f01\uff1a\u96fb\u754c\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30d4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30c7\u30b0\u30e9\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1a\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30d4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u5fdc\u7528", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u9078\u629e\uff1a\u30dd\u30ea\u30de\u30fc\u69cb\u9020\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u69cb\u7bc9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30b9\u30d4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u7d20\u6750\u5b9f\u9a13"]}

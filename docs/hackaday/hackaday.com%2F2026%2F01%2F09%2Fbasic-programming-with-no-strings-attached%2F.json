String art \u2014 also known as pin and thread art, or filography \u2014 is an art form where images are invoked by thread woven between pins on the border of an image. In this case the thread and the pins are virtual and there is a simple 67 line BASIC program which generates and renders them.\nOf course BASIC, the Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, isnt just one thing and was a bit of a moving target over the years. Invented in 1964 at Dartmouth College by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz it turned into a family of languages as a dynamic array of implementations added, removed, and changed implementation details as the future unrolled.\nWe remember GW-BASIC and QuickBASIC, but the landscape was much broader than that. Implementations of QuickBASIC came with a compiler, qb45.exe, which worked by bundling the BASIC script as p-code into an executable along with the runtime binary, which we used back in the day to make real applications, not mere scripts.\nThanks to [Keith Olson] for writing in to let us know about this one.

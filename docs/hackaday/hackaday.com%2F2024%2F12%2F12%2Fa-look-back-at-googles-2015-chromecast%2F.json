The device went through an additional two hardware generations before the entire line of products was discontinued earlier this year in favor of Google TV.\nMarvells Armada 88DE3006 dual-core Cortex-A7 powers the second-generation Chromecast. (Credit: Brian Dipert, EDN)\nIn addition to collecting each generation of Chromecast, [Brian Dipert] over at EDN looked back on this second-generation dongle from 2015 while also digging into the guts of a well-used example that got picked up used.\nWhile not having any of the fascinating legacy features of the 2nd-generation Ultra in his collection that came with the Stadia gaming controller, it defines basically everything that Chromecast dongles were about: a simple dongle with a HDMI  USB connector that you plugged into a display that you wanted to show streaming content on. The teardown is mostly similar to the 2015-era teardown by iFixit, who incidentally decided not to assign any repairability score, for obvious reasons.\nMost interesting about this second-generation Chromecast is that the hardware supported Bluetooth, but that this wasnt enabled until a few years later, presumably to fix the wonky new device setup procedure that would be replaced with a new procedure via the Google Home app.\nWhile Googles attention has moved on to newer devices, the Chromecast isnt dead  the dongles in the wild still work, and the protocol is supported by Google TV and many smart appliances including TVs and multimedia receivers."}

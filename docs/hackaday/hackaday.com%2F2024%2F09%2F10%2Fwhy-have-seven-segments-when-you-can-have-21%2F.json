The layout used no less than 21 discrete segments to display the complete roman alphabet and numerals, which is definitely not possible with the mere seven segments we are all familiar with. [monte] then did the decent thing and created a demonstration digit using modern parts.\nFor the implementation, [monte] created a simple PCB by hand (with an obvious mistake) and 3D-printed an enclosure and diffuser to match. After a little debugging, a better PCB was ordered from one of the usual overseas factories. There isnt a schematic yet, but they mention using a CH32V003 Risc-V micro, which can be seen sitting on the rear of the PCB.\nMaximum flexibility is ensured by storing every glyph as a 32-bit integer, with each LED corresponding to a single bit. Its interesting to note the display incorporates serifs, which are definitely optional, although you could display sans-serif style glyphs if you wanted to. There is now a bit of a job to work out how to map character codes to glyph codes, but you can have a go at that yourself here. Its still early doors on this project, but it has some real potential for a unique-looking display.\nWe love displays\u2014every kind. Heres a layout reminiscent of a VFD digit but done purely mechanically. And if you must limit yourself to seven digits, what about this unique thing?\n\n", "title": "1898\u5e74\u306e\u7279\u8a31\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "body": "1898\u5e74\u306b[George Mason]\u304c\u7279\u8a31\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u305f\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3063\u305f[monte]\u306f\u300121\u306e\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30d9\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u6570\u5b57\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u57fa\u677f\u3068\u30a8\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["1898\u5e74\u306e\u7279\u8a31\u306b\u89e6\u767a\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u8868\u793a\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b", "21\u500b\u306e\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u8868\u793a\u30c7\u30e2\u3092\u624b\u4f5c\u308a", "CH32V003 Risc-V\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30bb\u30b0\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6574\u6570\u3067\u30b0\u30ea\u30d5\u3092\u683c\u7d0d\u3057\u3001\u30bb\u30ea\u30d5\u3092\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u5236\u4f5c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u63a2\u308b"]}

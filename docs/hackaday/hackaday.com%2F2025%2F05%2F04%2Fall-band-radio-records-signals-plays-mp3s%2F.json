Its even better when its not old-school at all, but packed full of modern ICs and driven by a micro-controller like the dsPIC in [Minh Danh]s dsMP3 build. Best of all is when we get enough details that the author needs two blog posts  one for hardware, and one for firmware  like [Minh Danh] has done.\nThis build does it all: radio, MP3 playback, and records incoming signals. The radio portion of the build is driven by an Si4735, which allows for receiving both in FM and AM  with all the AM bands, SW, MW and LW available. The FM section does support RDS, though because [Minh Danh] ran out of pins on the dsPIC, isnt the perfect implementation.\nJust look at that thru-hole goodness.\nThe audio section is a good intro to audio engineering if youve never done a project like this: hes using a TDA1308 for headphones, which feeds into a NS8002 to drive some hefty stereo speakers and he tells you why he selected those chips, as well as providing broken-out schematics for each. Really, we cant say enough good things about this projects documentation.\nThats before we get to the firmware, where he tells us how he manages to get the dsPIC to read out MP3s from a USB drive, and write WAVs to it. One very interesting detail is how he used the dsPICs ample analog inputs to handle the front panel buttons on this radio: a resistor ladder. Its a great solution in a project thats full of them.\nOf course weve seen radio receivers before, and plenty of MP3 players, too  but this might be the first time weve seen an electronic Swiss army knife with all these features, and were very glad [Minh Danh] shared it with us.\n\n"}

This topic concerns the US military very much, as a big part of national security involves knowing everything that appears in the skies. This is the reason for the development of a new sensor suite by the Pentagon called GREMLIN. Recently, a new report has provided more details about what this system actually does.\nManaged by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) within the DoD, GREMLIN blends many different sensors, ranging from radar to ADS-B and RF monitors, together to establish a baseline and capture any anomalies within the 90-day monitoring period to characterize them.\nUAPs were a popular topic even before the 1950s when people began to see them everywhere. Usually taking the form of lights or fast-moving objects in the sky, most UAP reports can be readily classified as weather balloons, satellites like Starlink, airplanes, the Northern Lights, the ISS, or planets like Mars and Venus. There are also curious phenomena such as the Hessdalen lights, which appear to be a geological, piezoelectric phenomenon, though our understanding of such natural lighting phenomena remains limited.\nBut it is never aliens, thats one thing we know for sure. Not that UFOs dont exist. Really.\n\n", "title": "- \u672a\u78ba\u8a8d\u98db\u884c\u7269\u4f53\uff08UAP\uff09\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u8ecd\u306e\u95a2\u5fc3\u3068\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "body": "\u672a\u78ba\u8a8d\u73fe\u8c61\uff08UAP\uff09\u306f\u56fd\u9632\u306b\u95a2\u308f\u308b\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u89b3\u5bdf\u5bfe\u8c61\u3067\u3001\u30da\u30f3\u30bf\u30b4\u30f3\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fcGREMLIN\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002", "titles": ["- \u672a\u78ba\u8a8d\u98db\u884c\u7269\u4f53\uff08UAP\uff09\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u8ecd\u306e\u95a2\u5fc3\u3068\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "- GREMLIN\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff1aUAP\u76e3\u8996\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u6280\u8853", "- UAP\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6b63\u4f53\uff1a\u6c17\u8c61\u73fe\u8c61\u304b\u3089\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u307e\u3067", "- \u672a\u78ba\u8a8d\u7570\u5e38\u73fe\u8c61\uff08UAP\uff09\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89e3\u660e", "- UFO\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u5916\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

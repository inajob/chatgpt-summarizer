This latter case appears to be the issue befalling A3 Audio. So, the developers have done the next best thing, made the project open source, and are actively looking for more people to pitch in. So what is it? The project is centered around the idea of spatial audio or 3D audio. The system allows audio motion to be captured, mixed and replayed, all the while synchronized to the music. At least thats as much as we can figure out from the documentation!\nThe system is made up of three main pieces of hardware. The first part is the core (or server), which is essentially a Linux PC running an OSC (Open Sound Control) server. The second part is a motion sampler, which inputs motion into the server. Lastly, there is a Mixer, which communicates using the OSC protocol (over Ethernet) to allow pre-mixing of spatial samples and deployment of samples onto the audio outputs. In addition to its core duties, the core also manages effects and speaker handling.\nThe motion module is based around a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Teensy microcontroller, with a 7-inch touchscreen display for user input and oodles of NeoPixels for blinky feedback on the button matrix. The mixer module seems simpler, using just a Teensy for interfacing the UI components.\nWe dont see many 3D audio projects, but this neat implementation of a beam-forming microphone phased array\u00a0sure looks interesting.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e3D\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aA3 Audio", "body": "A3 Audio\u306f\u7acb\u4f53\u97f3\u97ff\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002Linux PC\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc\u3084\u30df\u30ad\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u69cb\u6210\u3002Raspberry Pi\u3068Teensy\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5165\u529b\u3068\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u7acb\u4f53\u97f3\u97ff\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e3D\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aA3 Audio", "A3 Audio\uff1a\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u306e\u7a7a\u9593\u97f3\u97ff\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Linux PC\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fA3 Audio\u306e\u30b3\u30a2\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305fA3 Audio\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb", "\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30ba\u30c9\u30a2\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f3D\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

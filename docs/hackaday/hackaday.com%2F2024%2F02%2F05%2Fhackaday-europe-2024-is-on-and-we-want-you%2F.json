If youre a European hacker, and have always wanted to join us up for Supercon in the states, heres your chance to do so without having to set sail across the oceans. Its great to be able to get together with our continental crew.\nJust like last time, well be meeting up in Berlin at Motionlab, Bouchestrasse 12 for a weekend of talks and workshops. On paper, the event runs April 13th and 14th, but if youre in town on Friday the 12th, well be going out for drinks and socializing beforehand. Saturday starts up at 9 AM and is going to be full of presentations, with food throughout and our own mix of hacking and music running until 2 AM. Sunday starts up a little bit later with brunch and as many lightning talks as we can fit into the afternoon.\nAnd as always, we want you to bring a project or two along to show and tell. Half the fun of an event like this, where everyone is on the same wavelength, is the mutual inspiration that lurks in nearly every random conversation. Its like Hackaday, but in real life!\nSo without further ado: get your tickets right here! We have a limited number of early-bird tickets at $70, and then the remainder will go on sale for $142 (plus whatever fees).\nCall for Participation\nSo who is going to be speaking at Hackaday Europe? You could be! Were also opening up the Call for Participation right now, both for talks and for workshops. Whether youve presented your work live before or not, youre not likely to find a more appreciative audience for epic hacks, creative constructions, or you own tales of hardware, firmware, or software derring-do.\nWorkshop space is limited, but if you want to teach a group of ten or so people your favorite techniques or build up a swarm of small robots, wed love to hear from you.\nAll presenters get in free, of course, and well give you an early-bird price even if we cant fit you into the schedule. So firm up what youd like to share, and get your proposal in before Feb 22.\nThe Badge\nPart of the fun of an event like this is sharing what youre working on with a rare like-minded crowd. True story: we came into last years Hackaday Berlin event with a raw idea for our own Superconference badge, that we needed to have done by November. Talks with [Schneider] about the lovely badge for the Chaos Communications Camp inspired us to use those sweet round screens, and a chat with [Stefan Holzapfel] convinced us of the possibility to run an audio DAC at DC.\nSo its fitting that well be bringing the Vectorscope badge to Berlin, with some new graphics of course. If you didnt catch it at Supercon, its a emulation of an old-timey X-Y mode oscilloscope and a DAC to drive it in software. Folks had a great time hacking it at Supercon, and you will too. Its analog, its digital, and its got room for a lot of art. Wed love to see what you bring to it!\nThanks and See You Soon!\nOf course, we cant put on an event like this without help from our fantastic sponsors, so wed like to say thanks to DigiKey for sponsoring not only the stateside Superconference, but also Hackaday Europe 2024. And as always, thanks to Supplyframe for making it all possible.\nApril is coming up fast, so get your proposals in and order your tickets now! We cant wait to see you all.\n"}

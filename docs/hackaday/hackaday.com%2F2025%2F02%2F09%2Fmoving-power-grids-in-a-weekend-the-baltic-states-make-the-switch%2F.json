Its a move replete with geopolitical significance, but its fascinating from our point of view as it gives a rare insight into high voltage grid technology.\nThere are a few news videos in the air showing contactors breaking the circuit, and even a cable-cutting moment, but in practice this is not as simple a procedure as unplugging an appliance from a wall socket. The huge level of planning that has gone into this move is evident in the countrywide precautions in case of power loss, and the heightened security surrounding the work. As we understand it at the moment the three countries exist as a temporary small grid of their own, also isolating the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad which now forms its own grid. The process of aligning the phase between Baltic and European grids has been under way overnight, and an online monitor shows significant frequency adjustments during that time. At some point on Sunday a new connection will be made to the European grid via Poland, and the process will be completed. We imagine that there will be a very relieved group of electrical engineers who will have completed their own version of a Moon landing when that has happened.\nIf you happen to live in either region, theres still some time to watch the process in action, by monitoring the supply frequency for yourself. Its not the first time that geopolitics have affected the European grid, as the continent lost six minutes a few years ago, and should you Americans think you are safe from such problems, think again.", "title": "- \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u4e09\u56fd\u304c\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u7db2\u304b\u3089\u8131\u5374", "body": "\u30d0\u30eb\u30c83\u56fd\u304c\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u304b\u3089\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u7db2\u3092\u5207\u308a\u96e2\u3057\u3001\u6b27\u5dde\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3002\u6280\u8853\u7684\u9032\u5c55\u3068\u5730\u653f\u5b66\u7684\u610f\u7fa9\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u4e09\u56fd\u304c\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u7db2\u304b\u3089\u8131\u5374", "- \u9ad8\u96fb\u5727\u6280\u8853\u306e\u8ee2\u63db\u70b9\uff1a\u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u4e09\u56fd\u3068\u6b27\u5dde\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a", "- \u96fb\u529b\u7cfb\u7d71\u306e\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf\u3068\u82e6\u52b4", "- \u96fb\u6c17\u6280\u8853\u8005\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u5730\u653f\u5b66\u3068\u96fb\u529b\u7db2\uff1a\u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u4e09\u56fd\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7"]}

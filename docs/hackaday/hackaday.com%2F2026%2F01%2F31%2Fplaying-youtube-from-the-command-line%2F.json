However, if youre looking to just listen to the audio, you can actually do that right from the terminal. You just need Shellbeats from [lalo-space].\nShellbeats is primarily intended for playing music from YouTube, and is well equipped for this task. It allows searching YouTube directly from the terminal, as well as streaming tracks or entire playlists from the command line interface. You can also make and edit playlists from within the tool, and even download the whole lot as MP3s if so desired. Its all keyboard-operated and nicely lightweight. The overall experience isnt dissimilar from operating a simple LCD-based MP3 player from 20 years ago.\nTheres plenty of other fun stuff you can do in the terminal, too, as weve explored previously.

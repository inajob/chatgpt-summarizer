Hence he jumped on the opportunity to source a Pico 2 clone board with the same MCU but with a USB-C connector from AliExpress. After receiving the new board, he set about comparing the two to see whether the clone board was worth it after all. In the accompanying video you can get even more details on why you should avoid this particular clone board.\nIn the video the respective components of both boards are analyzed and compared to see how they stack up. The worst issues with the clone Pico 2 board are an improper USB trace impedance at 130 \u03a9 with also a cut ground plane below it that wont do signal integrity any favors.\nThere is also an issue with the buck converter routing for the RP2350 with an unconnected pin (VREG_FB) despite the recommended layout in the RP2350 datasheet. Power supply issues continue with the used LN3440 DC-DC converter which can source 800 mA instead of the 1A of the Pico 2 version and performed rather poorly during load tests, with one board dying at 800 mA load.\n\n", "title": "- USB-C\u63a5\u7d9a\u306eRaspberry Pi Pico 2\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "\u30c8\u30fc\u30de\u30b9\u306fRaspberry Pi Pico 2\u306eUSB-C\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u57fa\u677f\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3001\u554f\u984c\u70b9\u3092\u6307\u6458\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3084\u96fb\u6e90\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- USB-C\u63a5\u7d9a\u306eRaspberry Pi Pico 2\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6027\u80fd\uff1aRaspberry Pi Pico 2\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044", "- Pico 2\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u554f\u984c\u70b9\uff1a\u4fe1\u53f7\u306e\u6574\u5408\u6027\u3068\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u4f9b\u7d66", "- USB\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30a4\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "- LN3440 DC-DC\u30b3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u6545\u969c\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u6790"]}

Thats precisely what [Ananya], [Laurence] and [Shao] did when they built Cucumber the Robot Dog for their final project in the ECE 4760 class.\nCucumber is controllable over WiFi, which was simple enough to implement by virtue of the fact that its based around the Raspberry Pi Pico W. With its custom 3D-printed dog-like body, its able to move around on its four wheels driven by DC gear motors, and it can flex its limbs thanks to servos in its various joints. Its able to follow someone with some autonomy thanks to its ultrasonic sensors, while it can also be driven around manually if so desired. To give it more animal qualities, it can also be posed, or commanded to bark, howl, or growl, with commands issued remotely via a web interface.\nThe level of sophistication is largely on the level of the robot dogs that were so popular in the early 2000s. One suspects it could be pretty decent at playing soccer, too, with the right hands behind the controls.

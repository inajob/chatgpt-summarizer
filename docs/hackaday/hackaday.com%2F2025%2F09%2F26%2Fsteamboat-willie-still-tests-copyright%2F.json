It entered the public domain last year, meaning that it and the 1928 incarnation of Mickey are now free of any copyright obligation to the media giant.\nTheres an interesting development from Florida on that front though as it seems Disney may have been testing this through legal means, and now a law firm wants to see them in court over their proposed use of the film in an advert.\nOf course here at Hackaday we dont cover the dry subject of Florida legal news as a rule, but we are interested in the world of copyright as it applies to many other things that do come under our eye. As we understand it the law firm is requesting the judge assert their protection from trademark claims over the use of Disneys 1928 Willie, given that there have been claims from the entertainment giant against others doing the same thing.\nIts hardly surprising that a large corporation might seek to use legal muscle and trademark law to de facto extend the term of Mickeys protection beyond the defined copyright expiration date, so for once its refreshing to see them come up against someone unafraid of a courtroom.\nWe hope that common sense will prevail, and this undermining of a cherished right (not to mention prior case law) is not allowed to succeed.

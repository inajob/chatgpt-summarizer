If thats you, you might consider taking a gander at [Peter Shirley]s e-book Learning Raytracing in One Weekend.\nThis gradient is the first image that the book talks you through producing. It ends with the spheres.\nThis is very much a zero-to-hero kind of class: it starts out defining the PPM image format, which is easy to create and manipulate using nearly any language. The book uses C++, but as [Peter] points out in the introduction, you dont have to follow along in that language; there wont be anything unique to C++ you couldnt implement in your language of choice.\nThere are many types of ray tracers. Technically, what you should end up with after the weekend ends is a path tracer. You wont be replacing the Blender Cycles renderer with your weekends work, but you get some nice images and a place to build from. [Peter] manages to cram a lot of topics into a weekend, including diffuse materials, metals, dialectrics, diffraction, and camera classes with simple lens effects.\nIf you find yourself with slightly more time, [Peter] has you covered. Hes also released books on Raytracing: The Next Week. If you have a lot more time, then check out his third book, Raytracing: The Rest of Your Life.\nThis weekend e-book shows that ray-tracing doesnt have to be the darkest of occult sciences; it doesnt need oodles of hardware, either. Even an Arduino can do it..", "title": "- \u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u9031\u672b\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "\u9031\u672b\u306b\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u300c\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u5165\u9580\u300d\u96fb\u5b50\u66f8\u7c4d\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u753b\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u304c\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1a\u9031\u672b\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0", "- C++\u306b\u3053\u3060\u308f\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff01\u3069\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u9031\u672b\u3067\u7fd2\u5f97\uff01\u30d1\u30b9\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3092\u5b66\u307c\u3046", "- \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3067\u5927\u304d\u306a\u6210\u529f\uff1aArduino\u3067\u306e\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u3088\u308a\u6df1\u304f\u5b66\u3073\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u3078\uff1a\u6b21\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u66f8\u7c4d\u6848\u5185"]}

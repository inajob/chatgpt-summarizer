If thats you, you might consider taking a gander at [Peter Shirley]s e-book Learning Raytracing in One Weekend.\nThis gradient is the first image that the book talks you through producing. It ends with the spheres.\nThis is very much a zero-to-hero kind of class: it starts out defining the PPM image format, which is easy to create and manipulate using nearly any language. The book uses C++, but as [Peter] points out in the introduction, you dont have to follow along in that language; there wont be anything unique to C++ you couldnt implement in your language of choice.\nThere are many types of ray tracers. Technically, what you should end up with after the weekend ends is a path tracer. You wont be replacing the Blender Cycles renderer with your weekends work, but you get some nice images and a place to build from. [Peter] manages to cram a lot of topics into a weekend, including diffuse materials, metals, dialectrics, diffraction, and camera classes with simple lens effects.\nIf you find yourself with slightly more time, [Peter] has you covered. Hes also released books on Raytracing: The Next Week. If you have a lot more time, then check out his third book, Raytracing: The Rest of Your Life.\nThis weekend e-book shows that ray-tracing doesnt have to be the darkest of occult sciences; it doesnt need oodles of hardware, either. Even an Arduino can do it.."}

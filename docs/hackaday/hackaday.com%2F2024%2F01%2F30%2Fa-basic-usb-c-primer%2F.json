Its a connector which can do so many things, so many in fact that it bears a handy explanation. The Electromagnetic Field 2022 hacker camp has been quietly uploading videos of its talks, and a recent one has [Tyler Ward] explaining the intricacies of the interface.\nMany of you will be familiar with XKCD number 927 which makes a joke about proliferating connector standards, and its evident that USB-C is a rare case of a connector which bucks the trend of simply making another standard, and has instead created something with which it makes sense to replace what went before. We learn about the intricacies of inter-device communications and USB-PD, and the multiple high-speed connection\u00a0 lanes shoehorned into it. That one small connector can plug into a laptop and provide power, USB peripherals including network, and display, is nothing short of amazing. Take a look at the video below the break, and if youre interested in diving deeper, have a look at our colleague [Arya Voronova]s USB-C for hackers series.\n\n", "title": "USB-C\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u78c1\u6c17\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c92022\u3067\u8aac\u660e", "body": "USB-C\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3084USB A\u3001micro USB\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306b\u591a\u304f\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u3068\u3057\u3066\u666e\u53ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002USB-PD\u3084\u9ad8\u901f\u63a5\u7d9a\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5b66\u3073\u3001\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u96fb\u529b\u3084\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9a5a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u6280\u8853\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["USB-C\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u78c1\u6c17\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c92022\u3067\u8aac\u660e", "USB-C\u304c\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u7406\u7531\u3092\u89e3\u8aac", "USB-C\u306e\u9ad8\u901f\u63a5\u7d9a\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308d\u3046", "\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3001\u96fb\u529b\u3084USB\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308bUSB-C\u306e\u9a5a\u7570", "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u300cUSB-C for hackers\u300d\u3067USB-C\u3092\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u89e3\u8aac"]}

They started to become useful around the end of the 1980s though as enterprising manufacturers started cramming full-fat PC XTs into pocket form factors. Of these the one to own was the Poqet PC, a slim clamshell design that would run for ages on a pair of AA cells . If you have one today youd be lucky if its display ribbon cable is without faults though, and [Roberts Retro] is here with a fix previously thought impossible.\nA large proportion of the video below the break is devoted to dismantling the unit, no easy task. The cable once exposed is found to have delaminated completely, and he takes us through the delicate task of attaching a modern equivalent. We particularly like the way in which the cables own springiness is used to retract it. The result has a white cable rather than the original black, but thats a small price to pay for a machine that works rather than a broken paperweight.\nIf early pocket computing is your thing, its a subject weve covered before.\n\n", "title": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8PC\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u306b\u4f7f\u3044\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u643a\u5e2f\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bfPoqet PC\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u3080\u52d5\u753b\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002AA\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u4fee\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3002\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u611b\u597d\u8005\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3002", "titles": ["1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u672b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8PC\u4fee\u7406\uff1a\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u4ea4\u63db\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\uff1aPoqet PC\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u4fee\u7406\u8853\uff1a\u767d\u3044\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8PC\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8d77\u6e90", "Poqet PC\uff1a\u4e8c\u672c\u306e\u53583\u96fb\u6c60\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u8584\u578b\u30af\u30e9\u30e0\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3"]}

And so it has come to pass, in the form of [Depep1]s Boaty, a model thats not a boat, but a bench. Sadly this is being written away from a 3D printer so we cant try it, but we can immediately see that its low bed contact area from having spindly legs would be a significant test for many printers bed adhesion, and it has overhangs and bridges aplenty.\nIts always interesting to see new takes on a printer stress test, after all we can all use something to check the health of our machines. But the Benchy saga isnt something we think should drive you away from the little boat we know and love, as it remains an open-source model as it always has been. We dont know the exact reasons why the derivatives were removed, but we understand from Internet scuttlebut that the waters may be a little more cloudy than at first supposed. If theres any moral at all to the story, it lies in reading and understanding open source licences, rather than just assuming they all allow us to do anything we want.\nMeanwhile its likely this model will be joined by others, and we welcome that. After all, innovation should be part of what open source does.\nMissed the Benchy takedown story? Catch up here.\nThanks [Jeremy G] for the tip."}

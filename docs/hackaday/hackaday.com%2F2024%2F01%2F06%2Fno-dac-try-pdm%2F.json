Try PDM", "link": "https://hackaday.com/2024/01/06/no-dac-try-pdm/", "source": "https://hackaday.com/blog/feed/", "thumbnail": "https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pdm.png", "original_content": "Ever notice that the ESP32-S3 doesnt have a digital-to-analog converter? [Chris] did and asserts that he doesnt care because he can just use the PDM system to get the same result. PDM  pulse density modulation  is similar to PWM and, like PWM, requires a filter that could range from a simple RC network to an active filter. You can see the result in the video below.\nThere are several ways [Chris] could produce the output he wanted. PWM was one choice, and some example code uses a timer to do PDM. However, that is not very efficient. The other alternative is to use the I2S output. However, this does require a few workarounds.\nIn particular, the I2S output is always stereo and incorporates a clock output that isnt needed for this application. [Chris] simply output the same value on both channels and routed the clock to some pins that are normally used for startup options. That means they cant easily be used for your own inputs, but its OK to use them for unimportant outputs.\nWe always enjoy seeing solutions like this because it can give you ideas for use in your own projects. Of course, this wont apply to every project where you need a DAC, but it still might give you some ideas.\nWe have looked at PDM before. You could, too, build your own DAC hardware.\n\n"}

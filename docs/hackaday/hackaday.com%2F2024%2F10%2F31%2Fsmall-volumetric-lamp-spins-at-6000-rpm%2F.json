Throw some LEDs together, take advantage of persistence of vision, and youve really got something. [Nick Electronics] shows us how its done with his neat little volumetric lamp build.\nThe concept is simple. [Nick] built a little device to spin a little rectangular array of LEDs. A small motor in the base provides the requisite rotational motion at a speed of roughly 6000 rpm. To get power to the LEDs while theyre spinning, the build relies on wire coils for power transmission, instead of the more traditional technique of using slip rings.\nThe build doesnt do anything particularly fancy\u2014it just turns on the whole LED array and spins it. Thats why its a lamp, rather than any sort of special volumetric display. Still, the visual effect is nice.\u00a0Weve seen some other highly capable volumetric displays before, though. Video after the break.\n\n"}

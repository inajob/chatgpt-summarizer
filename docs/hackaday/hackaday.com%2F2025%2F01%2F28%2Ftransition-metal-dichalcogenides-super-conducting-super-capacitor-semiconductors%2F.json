A recent number of papers have been published on these latter two applications, with [Rui] et al. demonstrating superconductivity in (InSe2)xNbSe2. The superconducting transition occurred at 11.6 K with ambient pressure.\nTwo review papers on transition metal sulfide TMDs as supercapacitor electrodes were also recently published by [Mohammad Shariq] et al. and [Can Zhang] et al. showing it to be a highly promising material owing to strong redox properties. As usual there are plenty of challenges to bring something like TMDs from the laboratory to a production line, but TMDs (really TMD monolayers) have already seen structures like field effect transistors (FETs) made with them, and used in sensing applications.\nTMDs consist of a transition-metal (M, e.g. molybdenum, tungsten) and a chalcogen atom (X, e.g. sulfur) in a monolayer with two X atoms (yellow in the above image) encapsulating a single M atom (black). Much like with other monolayers like graphene, molybdenene and goldene, it is this configuration that gives rise to unexpected properties. In the case of TMDs, some have a direct band gap, making them very suitable for transistors and perhaps most interestingly also for directly growing 3D semiconductor structures.\nHeading image: Crystal structure of a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenide.(Credit: 3113Ian, Wikimedia)", "title": "- \u9077\u79fb\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\uff08TMD\uff09\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "body": "\u9077\u79fb\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\u306f\u3001\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u3084\u8d85\u4f1d\u5c0e\u4f53\u306b\u6709\u671b\u3067\u3001\u7279\u306bFET\u3084\u96fb\u6975\u6750\u6599\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6ce8\u76ee\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u9077\u79fb\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u30ab\u30eb\u30b3\u30b2\u30ca\u30a4\u30c9\uff08TMD\uff09\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u3068\u5fdc\u7528", "- \u8d85\u4f1d\u5c0e\u4f53\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306eTMD\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u7d50\u679c", "- TMD\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u5c55\u671b", "- TMD\u306e\u5358\u5c64\u69cb\u9020\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7279\u7570\u306a\u6027\u8cea", "- \u7269\u6027\u304c\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308bTMD\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u6280\u8853"]}

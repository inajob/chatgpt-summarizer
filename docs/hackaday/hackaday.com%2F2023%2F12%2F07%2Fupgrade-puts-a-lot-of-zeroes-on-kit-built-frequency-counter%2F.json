Maybe rolling the odometer over to another 100,000 milestone?\nRegardless, getting to such a desirable degree of accuracy isnt always easy, especially when the instrument in question is a handheld frequency counter that was built from a kit 23 years ago. Thats the target of [Petteri Aimonen]s accuracy upgrade, specifically by the addition of a custom frequency reference module. The instrument is an ELV FC-500, which for such an old design looks surprisingly modern. Its Achilles heel in terms of accuracy is the plain crystal oscillator it uses as a frequency standard, which has no temperature compensation and thus drifts by about 0.2 ppm per degree.\nFor a mains-powered lab instrument, the obvious solution would be an oven-controlled crystal oscillator. Those are prohibitive in terms of space and power for a handheld instrument, so instead a VCTCXO  voltage-controlled, temperature-compensated crystal oscillator  was selected for better stability. Unfortunately, no such oscillators matching the original 4.096-MHz crystal spec could be found; luckily, a 16.384-MHz unit was available for less than \u20ac20. All that was required was a couple of flip-flops to divide the signal by four and a bit of a bodge to replace the original frequency standard. A trimmer allows for the initial calibration  the VC part  and the tiny PCB tucks inside the case near the battery compartment.\nWe enjoyed the simplicity of this upgrade  almost as much as we enjoyed seeing all those zeroes. When you know, you know."}

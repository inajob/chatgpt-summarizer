You can either make lots of small 3D prints and stick them together, or you can use a larger 3D printer. [Emily the Engineer] went the latter route by making her Ender 3 a full 10 feet tall.\nThe best Doug Dimmadome hat weve seen in a while, printed on the 10-foot Ender 3. If youre unfamiliar, Doug Dimmadome is the owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome.\nThe Ender 3s modular construction made this feat straightforward in the early steps. The printer was simply disassembled, with longer aluminium extrusions bolted in their place. New wheels were resin printed via Onshape to to run along the new extrusions, which were of a slightly different profile to the original parts. Wiring was also a hurdle, with the 10-foot printer requiring a lot longer cables than the basic Ender 3.\nAn early attempt to make the Z-axis work with a very long threaded rod failed. Instead, a belt-driven setup was subbed in, based on existing work to convert Ender 3s to belt drive. With a firmware mod and some wiring snarls fixed, the printer was ready to try its first high print. Amazingly, the printer managed to complete a print at full height, albeit the shaking of the tall narrow print lead to some print quality issues. The frame and base were then expanded and some struts installed to add stability, so that the printer could create taller parts with decent quality.\nWhile few of us would need a 10-foot high Ender 3, its easy to see the value in expanding your printers build volume with some easy mods. [Emily] just took it to the extreme, and thats to be applauded. Video after the break.\n\n"}

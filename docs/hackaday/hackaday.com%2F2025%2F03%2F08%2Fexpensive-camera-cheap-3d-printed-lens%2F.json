Once youve exhausted the possibilities of the kit lens, you can try different focal lengths and effects, but youll soon find out that good glass isnt cheap. Can you solve this problem by making your own lenses? [Billt] has done just that.\nGiven some CAD skills, its possible to replicate the mount on an existing lens, but he takes a shortcut by using a readily available camera cap project. There are two lenses detailed in the video below the break; the first is a plastic lens from a disposable camera, while the second takes one from a Holga toy camera. The plastic lens is inserted mid-print, giving the colour aberrations and soft focus youd expect, while the Holga lens is mounted on a slide for focusing. There may be some room for improvement there, but the result is a pair of fun lenses for experimentation for not much outlay. Given the number of broken older cameras out there, it should be relatively easy for anyone wanting to try this for themselves to have a go.\nThe video is below the break, but while youre on this path, take a look at a previous project using disposable camera lenses. Or, consider printing an entire camera.\n\n"}

Cable-driven systems are a classic solution, and a team of researchers from MIT and Zhejiang University recently shared some techniques for designing fully 3D printed cable-driven mechanisms.\nThe researchers developed a set of four primitive motion components: a bending component, a coil, screw-like, and a compressive component. These components can work together in series or parallel to make much more complicated structures. To demonstrate, the researchers designed a gripping tentacle, a bird\u2019s claw, and a lizard-like walking robot, but much more complicated structures are certainly possible. Additionally, since the cable itself is printed, it can have extra features, such as a one-way ratcheting mechanism or bumps for haptic feedback.\nThese printed cables are the most novel aspect of the project, and required significant fine-tuning to work properly. To have an advantage over manually-assembled cable-driven systems, they needed to be print-in-place. This required special printer settings to avoid delamination between layers of the cable, cables sticking to other components, or cables getting stuck in the mechanisms joints. After some experiments, the researchers found that nylon filament gives the best balance between cable strength and flexibility, while not adhering tightly to the PLA structure.\nWe\u2019ve seen cable-driven systems here a few times before. If you\u2019re interested in a deeper dive, we\u2019ve covered that too.\n\n\nThanks to [Madeinoz67] for the tip!", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u99c6\u52d5\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u624b\u6cd5", "body": "MIT\u3068\u6d59\u6c5f\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u99c6\u52d5\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u8efd\u91cf\u3067\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u69cb\u9020\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u99c6\u52d5\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u624b\u6cd5", "\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u99c6\u52d5\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u69cb\u6210\u8981\u7d20", "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u6280\u8853\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u30ca\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5f37\u976d\u3067\u67d4\u8edf\u306a\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u958b\u767a"]}

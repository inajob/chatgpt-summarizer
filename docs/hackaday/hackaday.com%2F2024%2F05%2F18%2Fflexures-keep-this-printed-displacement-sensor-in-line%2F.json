But with a clever design and a little electronics know-how, it turns out you can 3D print a displacement sensor for measuring in the micron range for only about $10.\nWhile the tool that [BubsBuilds] came up with isnt as compact as a dial indicator and probably wont win any industrial design awards, that doesnt detract from its usefulness. And unlike a dial indicator  at least the analog type  this sensor outputs an easily digitized signal. That comes courtesy of a simple opto-interrupter sensor, which measures the position of a fine blade within its field of view. The blade is attached to a flexure that constrains its movement to a single plane; the other end of the flexure has a steel ball acting as a stylus. In use, any displacement of the stylus results in more or less light being received by the phototransistor in the opto-interrupter; the greater the deflection, the less light and the lower the current through the transistor. In addition to the sensor itself, [Bub] printed a calibration jig that allows precision gauge blocks or simple feeler gauges to be inserted in front of the stylus. The voltage across the emitter resistor for these known displacements is then used to create a calibration curve.\n[Bub] says hes getting 5-micron repeatability with careful calibration and multiple measurements of each gauge block, which seems pretty impressive to us. If you dont need the digital output, this compliant mechanism dial indicator might be helpful too.\n\nThanks to [Bub]s friend [Ethan] for the tip."}

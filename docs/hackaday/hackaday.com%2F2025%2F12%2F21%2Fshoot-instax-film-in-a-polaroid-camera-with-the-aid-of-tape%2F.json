Fresh film is easy to find but relatively expensive. In contrast, Fujis Instax line of instant film and cameras arent as well established, but the film is easy to find and cheap. You might like to shoot cheap Instax film in your Polaroid camera. Thankfully, [Nick LoPresti] figured out how to do just that.\nYou cant just slam an Instax cassette in an old Polaroid camera and expect it to work. The films are completely different sizes, and theres no way they will feed properly through the cameras mechanisms at all. Instead, you have to get manual about things. [Nick] starts by explaining the process of removing Instax film sheets from a cassette, which must be done without exposure to light if you want the film to remain useful. Then, if you know what youre doing, you can tape it in place behind the lens of an old-school Polaroid camera, and expose it as you would any other shot. The chemistry is close enough that youll have a fair chance of getting something with passable exposure.\nOnce exposed, you have to develop the film. Normally, a Polaroid camera achieves this by squeezing the film sheet out through rollers to release the developer and start the process. Without being able to rely on the cameras autofeed system, you need to find an alternative way to squeeze out the chemicals and get the image to develop. [Nick] recommends a simple kitchen rolling pin, while noting that you might struggle with some uneven chemical spread across the sheet.\u00a0Ultimately, its a fussy hack, but it does work. It might only be worthwhile if youve got lots of Instax film kicking around and no other way to shoot it.\nInstant cameras can seem a little arcane, but theyre actually quite simple to understand once you know how theyre built. You can even 3D print one from scratch if youre so inclined.

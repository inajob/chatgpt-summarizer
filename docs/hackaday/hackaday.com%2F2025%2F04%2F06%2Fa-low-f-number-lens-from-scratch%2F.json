Lenses with low F-numbers are prized by photographers for their properties, but are usually expensive because making a good one can be something of a challenge. Nevertheless [Rulof] is giving it a go, making an 80mm F0.5 lens with a Sony E-mount. The video below the break has all the details, and also serves as a fascinating primer on lens design if you are interested.\nRather than taking individual lenses, hes starting with the second-hand lens from an old projector. Its got the required huge aperture, but its by no means a photographic lens. An interesting component is his choice of diaphragm for the variable aperture, its a drafting aid for drawing circles which closely resembles a photographic part. This is coupled with the triplet from an old SLR lens in a 3D-printed enclosure, and the result is a lens that works even if it may not be the best. We know from experiences playing with lens systems that adjusting the various components of a compound lens like this one can be very difficult; we can see it has the much sought-after bokeh or blurred background, but it lacks sharpness.\nPerhaps because a camera is an expensive purchase, we dont see as much of this kind of hacking as wed like. Thats not to say that lenses dont sometimes make their way here.\n\n", "title": "- F0.5\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u4e2d\u53e4\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "body": "F\u5024\u306f\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u5149\u53ce\u96c6\u529b\u3092\u793a\u3057\u3001\u4f4e\u3044\u307b\u3069\u4eba\u6c17\u3002Rulof\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u300180mm F0.5\u3092\u88fd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- F0.5\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u5236\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u4e2d\u53e4\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "- \u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u89e3\u8aac\u52d5\u753b\u4ed8\u304d", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u3067\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30dc\u30b1\u5473", "- \u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306b\u6311\u3080DIY\u7cbe\u795e\u3092\u523a\u6fc0\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30d7\u3055\u306f\u6b20\u3051\u308b\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30c1\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u4f5c\u6210"]}

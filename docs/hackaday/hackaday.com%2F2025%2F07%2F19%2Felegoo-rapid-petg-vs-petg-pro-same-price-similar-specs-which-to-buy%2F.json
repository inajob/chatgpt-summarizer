Take for example Elegoos PETG filament offerings, which include such varieties like Pro and Rapid. Both cost the same, but is there a reason to prefer one over the other, perhaps even just for specific applications? To test this, [Dr. Igor Gaspar] over at the My Tech Fun YouTube channel bought some spools of these two filaments and subjected both to a series of tests.\nObviously, the Rapid filament is rated for higher extrusion speeds  270 vs 600 mm/s  while the website claims a higher required nozzle temperature that confusingly does not match those listed on the spool. There are quite a few differences in the listed specifications, including the physical and mechanical properties, which make it hard to draw any immediate conclusions. Could you perhaps just use Rapid PETG and forget about the Pro version?\nTest objects were printed with a Bambu Lab P1P with an AMS unit. After calibrating the ideal temperature for each filament, a tensile break test gave a win to the Rapid PETG, followed by a layer adhesion test win. This pattern continued across further tests, with Rapid PETG either matching or beating the Pro PETG.\nThere are only two advantages of the Pro version that can be seen here, which are less moisture sensitivity and\u00a0 stringing risk, and you of course get the luxury cardboard spool with the closed edges. Whether thats enough to make you go Pro remains to be seen, of course.\n\n", "title": "- Elegoo\u306ePETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aRapid\u3068Pro\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "Elegoo\u306ePETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306f\u3001Pro\u3068Rapid\u306e2\u7a2e\u3042\u308a\u3001Rapid\u304c\u6027\u80fd\u3067\u512a\u308c\u305f\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u793a\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- Elegoo\u306ePETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aRapid\u3068Pro\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- Rapid PETG\u3068Pro PETG\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3092\u9078\u3076\u3079\u304d\u304b\uff1f", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u5206\u304b\u3063\u305fRapid PETG\u306e\u512a\u4f4d\u6027", "- Pro\u7248\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\uff1aRapid PETG\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u5206\u6790", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5fc5\u898b\uff01PETG\u30d5\u30a3\u30e9\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9"]}

If you dont want to buy off the shelf, though, you could always follow [Manolo]s example and build your own.\nThis DIY headset is known as the Persephone 3 Lite, and is intended for use with SteamVR.\u00a0 Its got the requisite motion tracking thanks to a Raspberry Pi Pico, paired with an MPU6500 inertial measurement unit. As for the optics, the headset relies on a pair of 2.9-inch square displays that operate at a resolution of 1440 x 1440 with a refresh rate up to 90 Hz. Theyre paired with cheap Fresnel lenses sourced from Aliexpress for a few dollars. Everything is wrapped up in a custom 3D-printed housing that holds all the relevant pieces in the right place so that your eyes can focus on both screens at once. The head strap is perhaps the only off-the-shelf piece, sourced from a Quest 2 device.\nIf youre eager to recreate this build at home, files are available over on [Manolos] Patreon page for subscribers. Weve featured some other DIY headset builds before, too. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPersephone 3 Lite\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "DIY VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPersephone 3 Lite\u300d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300cPersephone 3 Lite\u300d\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- Raspberry Pi Pico\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fDIY VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306e\u81ea\u4f5cVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u5236\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30ebVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8", "- \u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eFresnel\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fVR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08"]}

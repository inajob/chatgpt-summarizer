If youre quick, you can pick one up on the usual second-hand sales sites with little wear and tear for a steal. Theyre not perfect machines by any stretch of the imagination, but they can be improved upon, and undoubtedly useful so long as you keep your expectations realistic.\n[ForOurGood] has set about such an improvement process and documented their journey in a whopping eight-part (so far!) video series. The video linked below is the most recent in the series and is dedicated to creating a brushless spindle motor on a budget.\nAs you would expect from such a machine, you get exactly what you pay for.\u00a0 The low cost translates to thinner than ideal metal plates, aluminium where steel would be better, lower-duty linear rails, and wimpy lead screws. The spindle also suffers from cost-cutting, as does the size of the stepper motors. But for the price, all is forgiven. The fact that they can even turn a profit on these machines shows the manufacturing prowess of the Chinese factories.\nWe covered the CNC 3018 a while back, and the comments of that post are a true gold mine for those wanting to try desktop CNC. Warning, though: Its a fair bit harder to master than 3D printing!\n\n\nThanks to [Thomas] for the tip!", "title": "\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u3068\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5922\u306b\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u611f\u3058\u308b\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u304cCNC3018\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6539\u5584\u306e\u4f59\u5730\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5236\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3088\u308a\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u90e8\u5206\u3082\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u30ec\u30b9\u30b9\u30d4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "CNC3018\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6539\u5584\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9", "\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u306aCNC3018\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b", "\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308bCNC3018\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7CNC\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc", "CNC3018\u3092\u4e0a\u624b\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30b3\u30c4"]}

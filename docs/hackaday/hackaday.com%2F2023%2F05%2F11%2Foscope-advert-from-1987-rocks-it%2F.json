You can see it below and enjoy the glorious music and video production standards of the 1980s.\nWe assume this was made to show at some trade show or the like. Even if there was a Home Shopping Network in 1987, we doubt many of these would have been sold despite the assertion they were low cost  clearly a relative term in this case.\nYouve got to wonder if the narrator understood what he was saying or if he was just reading from a script. Pretty impressive either way. We loved these old scopes, although we also like having very capable scopes that dont strain our backs to lift.\nOn the bright side, these scopes today are pretty affordable on the used market if you can find one that doesnt need a repair with an exotic part. For example, we found several 2221s or 2221As for under $200 without looking hard. The shipping, of course, could potentially almost double the price.\nWhile you can get a modern scope for $200, it probably isnt the same quality as a Tektronix. Then again, the new scope wont have CRTs and exotic Tektronix parts to wear out, either. Picking a scope is a pretty personal affair, though, so one persons great scope might be another persons piece of junk.\n\n", "title": "\u300c1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u300d\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u6620\u50cf\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u5e83\u544a\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "body": "\u30c6\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u306e1987\u5e74\u306e\u5e83\u544a\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u304c\u767a\u898b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u5f53\u6642\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306f\u4e2d\u53e4\u5e02\u5834\u3067\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u5b89\u304f\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u5834\u5408\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306b\u306a\u308a\u5f97\u308b\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3046\u7279\u5fb4\u304c\u3042\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u9078\u3076\u306e\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306a\u55dc\u597d\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u300d\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u6620\u50cf\u5236\u4f5c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u5e83\u544a\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u4f4e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u306a\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u304c1987\u5e74\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\uff1f", "\u5f8c\u308d\u306b\u8ca0\u62c5\u3092\u304b\u3051\u306a\u3044\u9ad8\u6a5f\u80fd\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3001\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u65e7\u578b\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3082\u683c\u5b89\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u3002", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u5b89\u3044\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306f\u3001\u30c6\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30b9\u88fd\u3068\u306f\u6bd4\u3079\u3082\u306e\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff1f", "\u30aa\u30b7\u30ed\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u9078\u3073\u65b9\u306f\u3001\u4eba\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u9055\u3046\u3002\u81ea\u5206\u306b\u5408\u3063\u305f\u6a5f\u7a2e\u3092\u9078\u307c\u3046\u3002"]}

[Bringus Studios] wanted a Wii that physically matched the grandeur of one of Nintendos greatest successes, and built the Wii XL.\nBasing the scale of this console around an 80 mm case fan, the final product has twelve times the volume of the original Wii. This leaves plenty of room for an unmodified original Wii, its power brick, and all the various cables and adapters necessary to bring the ports to the exterior of the case. To power the fan, [Bringus Studios] designed his first PCB to leach power off one of the USB connectors while still allowing data to pass through.\nGiven the size constraints of his 3D printers, he used melamine MDF for the sides and had to print the other panels in multiple pieces, resulting in some gapping in the front panel where the prints peeled off the print bed. We really love the use of a modular design that leaves room for future improvements, since no project is ever truly done.\nPower is routed through a figure eight power connector on the outside to a female two prong plug on the inside while USB and HDMI are routed out the back via a combination panel connector intended for RV and boat use. If you dont remember the Wii having HDMI out, thats because it didnt, but HDMI adapters are easy to come by for the machine.\nIn case you want to see more supersized projects checkout this giant XBox Series X or ponder if it wouldve been better with an enormous 555.\n\n"}

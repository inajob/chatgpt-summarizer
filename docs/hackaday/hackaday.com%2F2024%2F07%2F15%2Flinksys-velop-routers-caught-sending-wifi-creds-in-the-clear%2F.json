That would be bad enough, but not only are these routers reporting private information to the mothership, they are doing it in clear text for anyone to listen in on.\nTestaankoop says that while testing out the Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7 versions of Velop routers, they discovered that unencrypted packets were being sent to a server hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In these packets, they discovered not only the SSID of the users wireless network, but the encryption key necessary to join it. There were also various tokens included that could be used to identify network and user.\nWhile the report doesnt go into too much detail, it seems this information is being sent as part of the configuration process when using the official Linksys mobile application. If you want to avoid having your information bounced around the Internet, you can still use the routers built-in web configuration menus from a browser on the local network  just like in the good old days.\nThe real kicker here is the response from Linksys, or more accurately, the lack thereof. Testaankoop says they notified them of their discovery back in November of 2023, and got no response. Theres even been firmware updates for the affected routers since then, but the issue is still unresolved.\nTestaankoop ends the review by strongly recommending users avoid these particular models of Linksys Velop routers, which given the facts, sounds like solid advice to us. They also express their disappointment in how the brand, a fixture in the consumer router space for decades, has handled the situation. If you ask us, things started going downhill once they stopped running Linux on their hardware.", "title": "Linksys\u306eVelop Pro\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304cWiFi\u69cb\u6210\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u305b\u305a\u306b\u9001\u4fe1", "body": "Belgian consumer group Testaankoop\u304c\u5831\u544a\u3057\u305f\u554f\u984c: Linksys\u306eVelop Pro routers\u306e\u4e00\u90e8\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304cWiFi\u8a2d\u5b9a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u8a2d\u5b9a\u4e2d\u306b\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u60c5\u5831\u306f\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305a\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u306b\u3082\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u5831\u544a\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3068\u3001Linksys\u306e\u56de\u7b54\u3082\u9045\u304f\u3001\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u308b\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52e7\u544a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["Linksys\u306eVelop Pro\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304cWiFi\u69cb\u6210\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u6697\u53f7\u5316\u305b\u305a\u306b\u9001\u4fe1", "\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u304c\u9001\u4fe1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u554f\u984c", "\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7", "Linksys\u306eVelop\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c", "Linksys\u306eVelop\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u554f\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30b9\u793e\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc"]}

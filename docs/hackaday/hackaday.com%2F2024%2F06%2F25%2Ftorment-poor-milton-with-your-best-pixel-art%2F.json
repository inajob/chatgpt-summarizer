Thats it? Thats it. The code is available on the GitHub repository, but theres also a link to play it live without any kind of signup or anything. Give it a try if you have a few spare minutes.\nUnder the hood, the basic loop is to let the user add something to the room, send the picture of the room (with its new contents) off for image recognition, then get Miltons reaction to it. Milton is equal parts annoyed and jumpy, and his speech and reactions reflect this.\nThe game is a bit of a concept demo for Open Souls whose thing is providing AIs with far more personality and relatable behaviors than one typically expects from large language models. Maybe this is just whats needed for AI opponents in things like the putting game of Connect Fore! to level up their trash talking."}

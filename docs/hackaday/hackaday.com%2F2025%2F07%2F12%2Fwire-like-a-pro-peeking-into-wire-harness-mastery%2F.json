This awesome page sent in by [JohnU] is a fantastic corner of the internet that lets us all peek over that shoulder to see someone whos not only spent decades learning the art of of creating cable harnesses, but has taken the time to distill some of that vast experience for the rest of us to benefit from.\n\nThis page is focused on custom automotive and motorcycle modifications, but its absolutely jam-packed with things applicable in so many areas. It points out how often automotive wiring is somewhat taken for granted, but it shouldnt be; there are hundreds of lines, all of which need to work for your car to run in hot and cold, wet and dry. The reliability of wiring is crucial not just for your car, but much larger things such as the 530 km (330 mi) of wiring inside an Airbus A380 which, while a large plane, is still well under 100 m in length.\nThis page doesnt just talk about cable harnessing in the abstract; in fact, the overwhelming majority of it revolves around the practical and applicable. There is a deep dive into wiring selection, tubing and sealing selection, epoxy to stop corrosion, and more. It touches on many of the most common connectors used in vehicles, as well as connectors not commonly used in the automotive industry but that possess many of the same qualities. There are some real hidden gems in the midst of the 20,000+ word compendium, such as thermocouple wiring and some budget environmental sealing options.\nThere is far more to making a thing beyond selecting the right parts; how its assembled and the tools used are just as important. This page touches on tooling, technique, and planning for a wire harness build-up. While there are some highly specialized tools identified, there are also things such as re-purposed knitting needles. Once a harness is fully assembled its not complete, as there is also a need for testing that must take place which is also touched on here.\nThanks to [JohnU] for sending in this incredible learning resource.

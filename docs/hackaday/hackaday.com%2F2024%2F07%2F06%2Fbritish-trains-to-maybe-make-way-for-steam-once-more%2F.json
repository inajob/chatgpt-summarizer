The original main-line rail propulsion technology still clings on in a few places, but for practical purposes, it disappeared a lifetime ago. Its interesting then to hear of a brand new steam locomotive prototype being considered for revenue freight use on British metals. Is it yet another rebuild of a heritage design to be used for enthusiasts only? No, its an entirely new design with nothing in common with the locomotives of the past, as [Terrier55Stepney] tells us in the video below the break.\nGone is the huge boiler and reciprocating pistons of old, as indeed is the notion of boiling anything. Instead, this is a steam turbine, nothing like the 1920s and 30s experiments with conventional locomotives, nor even the Union Pacifics oil-fired condensing turbo-electrics. The new idea here from the British company Steamology is to create steam directly from the combustion of hydrogen in a series of small modular steam generators, and the resulting prototype turbo-generator will replace the diesel engine in a redundant British Rail class 60 freight locomotive. Its unclear whether it will incorporate a condenser, but since it has no need to retain the water for a boiler were not sure it would need one.\nPrototype locomotives featuring new technologies have a long and inglorious history of not making the grade, so while this is definitely an exciting and interesting development were not guaranteed to see it in widespread use. But it could offer a way to ensure a low-carbon replacement for diesel heavy freight locomotives, and unexpectedly provide engine upgrades for existing classes. The fact its technically a steam locomotive is incidental.\n\n\nBR Class 60: Tutenkhamun Sleeping, CC BY 2.0.", "title": "\u84b8\u6c17\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\uff1a\u82f1\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u5546\u696d\u8ca8\u7269\u5229\u7528\u3092\u8003\u616e", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u9244\u9053\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u3092\u8208\u596e\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306f\u3001\u84b8\u6c17\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca\u306e\u59ff\u3060\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u84b8\u6c17\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u3001\u6c34\u9244\u7832\u3092\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u77f3\u70ad\u3092\u7d20\u76f4\u306b\u71c3\u3084\u3059\u3053\u3068\u3067\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u84b8\u6c17\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\uff1a\u82f1\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u5546\u696d\u8ca8\u7269\u5229\u7528\u3092\u8003\u616e", "\u84b8\u6c17\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca\uff1a\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3", "\u4f4e\u70ad\u7d20\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\uff1aBR\u30af\u30e9\u30b960\u306e\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306b\u84b8\u6c17\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u3092\u5c0e\u5165", "\u84b8\u6c17\u767a\u96fb\u6a5f\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30a4\u30ae\u30ea\u30b9\u4f01\u696dSteamology\u306e\u6311\u6226", "\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306b\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\uff1a\u9a5a\u304d\u306e\u84b8\u6c17\u6a5f\u95a2\u8eca"]}

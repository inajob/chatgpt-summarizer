[Ben] decided to make a digital photo frame using an e-ink display to change things up, and unlike some commercial versions weve seen, its actually pretty tasteful!\nThe build is based on a Nook Simple Touch Reader, which can be had pretty cheaply on the used market. It was chosen for the fact it runs Android, which makes it comparatively easy to hack and customize compared to some other e-readers on the market. Once its running a custom Android brew, it can be set to run an app called Electric Sign which simply shows a given website fullscreen and updates it at regular intervals. That turns the Nook into a remotely updateable photo frame in one fell swoop. From there, it just took a little trickery to access an iCloud album to update the frame with fresh pics. Then [Ben] just had to customize a nice photo frame to neatly mount the e-reader with room for the cable to subtly snake out the back.\nIts a simple build that relies on some existing tools already laying around the Internet. Thats nice, because it makes it easy for anyone to replicate themselves at home given the same materials. Weve seen some other great digital photo frames before, too. If youve built your own neat and creative way to display your pics, dont hesitate to drop us a line!"}

But unlike [Patrick Gibney], we never thought of printing a faux wood log coaster that looks like it has rings. Check out the video below to see how it works.\nThe filament is not really wood, of course, but a polymer  usually PLA  mixed with wood particles. Changing the temperature does a nice job of darkening the wood. However, it also changes the properties of the carrier polymer, and thats not always a good thing.\n\n[Patrick] is manually adjusting the temperature and only using the wood filament for a layer or two, which is smart  theres no reason to have wood-grained patterns inside your print. There have been scripts for this technique, although some are too outdated to work with modern slicers.\nWhile we arent a fan of printing the dark areas at nearly 300C, it seems to work, and the rough appearance helps in this particular case.\nAnother option is to print using sawdust. There are plenty of exotic filament options out there. Wood is only the tip of the tree?\n"}

Apply pressure from multiple sources while the attacker is the only one stepping forward to help, then inherit the trust built up by the original maintainer. Sadly, [Rob] sees in these interactions a microcosm of what happens far too frequently in open source.\nMaintaining open source projects can be a high stress activity. The pressure and expectations to continually provide timely interaction, support, and updates can easily end up being unhealthy. As [Rob] points out (and other developers have observed in different ways), this kind of behavior just seems more or less normal for some projects.\nThe xz/liblzma vulnerability itself is a developing story, read about it and find links to the relevant analyses in our earlier coverage here.", "title": "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u904b\u55b6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u3068\u5065\u5eb7", "body": "liblzma\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u305fssh\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30a2\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8b70\u8ad6\u3084\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u304c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3092\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3092\u6307\u6458\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9ad8\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u7dad\u6301\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u8ff0\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u904b\u55b6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u3068\u5065\u5eb7", "xz\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u306eliblzma\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u306e\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u8106\u5f31\u6027", "\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u904e\u52b4", "\u4fe1\u983c\u306e\u7d99\u627f\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u554f\u984c", "xz/liblzma\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u306e\u5206\u6790\u3068\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

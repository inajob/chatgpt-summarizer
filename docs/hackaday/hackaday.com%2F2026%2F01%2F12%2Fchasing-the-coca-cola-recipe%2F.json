There are other colas, and there are many amateurs who have tried to copy Cokes flavour, but in well over a century, nobody has managed it. Why does [LabCoatz] think his attempt will be successful where others failed? He has friends with their own mass spectrometers.\n\nThe video below the break is a nearly half-hour exploration into food chemistry and the flavour profile of the well-known soft drink. Its easy to name many of the ingredients, but some, such as acetic acid, are unexpected. Replicating the contribution from Cokes de-cocainised coca leaf extract requires the purchase of some of the constituent chemicals in pure form. Its value lies in showing us how flavour profiles are built up, and the analytical methods used in their decoding.\nHe makes the point that Coke has never patented the formula because to do so would reveal it, but perhaps in that lies the real point. The value in a secret formula for brands such as Coke lies not in the secret itself, as its not difficult to make a refreshing cola drink. Instead, its the mystique of their product having a secret recipe that matters. Since this isnt the recipe itself but something thats supposed to taste a lot like it, that mystique stays intact. Hes not positioning his Lab-Cola as the real thing, so while we might have used a different label colour and font just to make sure, were guessing hes safe from the lawyers. If youre interested in the legal grey areas surrounding perceived infringement, though, its a topic weve looked at before.\n\nThanks [Hans] for the tip!"}

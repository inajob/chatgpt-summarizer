Its a small PCB that forms a computer running BASIC. Not simply a microcontroller with a serial header, this machine is a fully functioning BASIC desktop computer that takes a PS/2 keyboard and a VGA monitor. Would that cheap price stand up?\nThe board uses a CH32 microcontroller, a RISC-V part thats certainly very cheap indeed and pretty powerful, paired with an I2C memory chip for storage. The software is TinyBASIC. Theres some GPIO expandability and an I2C bus, and its claimed it can run in headless mode for a BASIC program to control things.\nWe havent added up all the parts in the BoM to check, but even if its not a one dollar computer it must come pretty close. We can see it could make a fun project for anyone. Its certainly not the only small BASIC board out there, its got some competition.\nThanks [Metan] for the tip."}

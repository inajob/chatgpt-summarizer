Usually they pass unnoticed or generate a spectacular light show, and very rarely a few pieces make it to the surface of the planet. Coming up though is something entirely different, a re-entry of a redundant craft in which the object in question might make it to the ground intact. To find out more about the story we have to travel back to the early 1970s, and Kosmos-482. It was a failed Soviet Venera mission, and since its lander was heavily over-engineered to survive entry into the Venusian atmosphere theres a fascinating prospect that it might survive Earth re-entry.\nThis model of the earlier Venera 7 probe shows the heavy protection to survive entry into the Venusian atmosphere. Emerezhko, CC BY-SA 4.0.\nAt the time of writing the re-entry is expected to happen on the 10th of May, but as yet due to its shallow re-entry angle it is difficult to predict where it might land. It is thought to be about a metre across and to weigh just under 500 kilograms, and its speed upon landing is projected to be between 60 and 80 metres per second. Should it hit land rather than water then, its remains are thought to present an immediate hazard only in its direct path.\nWere it to be recovered it would be a fascinating artifact of the Space Race, and once the inevitable question of its ownership was resolved  do marine salvage laws apply in space? wed expect it to become a world class museum exhibit. If that happens, we look forward to bringing you our report if possible.\nThis craft isnt the only surviving relic of the Space Race out there, though it may be the only one we have a chance of seeing up-close. Some of the craft from that era are even still alive.\nHeader: Moini, CC0.", "title": "- \u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u907a\u7269\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u5927\u6c17\u570f\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u3059\u308b\u65e7\u30bd\u9023\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f", "body": "\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u30bd\u9023\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u304c\u5730\u7403\u306b\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u4e88\u5b9a\u3002\u751f\u5b58\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3001\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u907a\u7269\u306b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u907a\u7269\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u5927\u6c17\u570f\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u3059\u308b\u65e7\u30bd\u9023\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30e2\u30b9482\uff1a\u91d1\u661f\u63a2\u67fb\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u5165\u5834\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u5730\u7403\u306b\u8feb\u308b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\uff1a\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5b87\u5b99\u8239\u306e\u904b\u547d", "- \u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u907a\u7523\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u6a5f\u306e\u518d\u7a81\u5165\u3068\u535a\u7269\u9928\u5c55\u793a\u306e\u671f\u5f85", "- \u5730\u7403\u306b\u843d\u4e0b\u3059\u308b\u304b\uff1f\u30b3\u30b9\u30e2\u30b9482\u306e\u7740\u9678\u4e88\u6e2c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

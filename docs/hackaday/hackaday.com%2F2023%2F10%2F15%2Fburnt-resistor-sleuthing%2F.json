You open it up and immediately see the burned remains of a resistor. You dont have the schematic, the Internet has nothing to say, and the markings on the resistor are burned away. What do you do? [Learn Electronics Repair] has some advice.\nThe resistor is probably open, but even if it isnt, you cant count on any measurement you make. The burning could easily change the value. The technique comes from comments on one of his earlier videos where he had such a burned resistor but was able to find the correct value. He decided to test the suggestion: cut away the burned resistor and measure the pieces that are left. It probably wont give you the exact value, but it will get you in the ballpark.\nSo a rotary tool did the surgery, and you can see it all in the video below. We arent sure this method would work on every type of resistor you might encounter, and surface mount will also present special problems. However, if you are stabbing in the dark anyway, it wont hurt to try.\nEveryone knows the smoke that comes out is magic. Sometimes, you cut into components by necessity. Other times, it is for arts sake.\n\n"}

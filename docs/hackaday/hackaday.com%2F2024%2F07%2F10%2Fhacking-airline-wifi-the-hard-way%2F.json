You are on a flight, theres WiFi, but you hate to pay the few bucks just to watch dog videos. What to do? Well, we would never suggest you engage in theft of service, but as an intellectual exercise, [Robert Heaton] had an interesting idea. Could the limited free use of the network be coopted to access the general internet? Turns out, the answer is yes.\nAdmittedly, it is a terrible connection. Heres how it works. The airline lets you get to your frequent flier account. When there, you can change information such as your name. A machine on the ground can also see that change and make changes, too. Thats all it takes.\nIt works like a drop box. You take TCP traffic, encode it as fake information for the account and enter it. You then watch for the response via the same channel and reconstitute the TCP traffic from the remote side. Now the network is at your fingertips.\nTheres more to it, but you can read about it in the post. It is slow, unreliable, and you definitely shouldnt be doing it. But from the point of view of a clever hack, we loved it. In fact, [Robert] didnt do it either. He proved it would work but did all the development using GitHub gist as the drop box. While we appreciate the hack, we also appreciate the ethical behavior!\nSome airlines allow free messaging, which is another way to tunnel traffic. If you can connect to something, you can probably find a way to use it as a tunnel.", "title": "WiFi\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u7121\u6599\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3067\u7121\u6599WiFi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6a21\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u8a66\u307f\u3002\u983b\u7e41\u306a\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3001\u5236\u9650\u6642\u9593\u5185\u306b\u4e00\u822c\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3078\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u8003\u3048\u3002\u4f4e\u901f\u304b\u3064\u4e0d\u5b89\u5b9a\u3060\u304c\u3001\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u624b\u6cd5\u3002\u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u3082\u8981\u7d04\u6587\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["WiFi\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u7121\u6599\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u63a5\u7d9a\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "TCP\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u822a\u7a7a\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u4e2d\u306b\u7121\u6599\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30c8\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u30c8\u30f3\u30cd\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "GitHub gist\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u822a\u7a7a\u4f1a\u793e\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0", "\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306eWiFi\u3092\u81ea\u5728\u306b\u5229\u7528"]}

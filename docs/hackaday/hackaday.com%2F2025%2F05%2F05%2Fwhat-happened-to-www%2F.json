And yet, these days, most of us go straight to hackaday.com without bothering with those three letters that once defined the internet.\nHave you ever wondered why those letters were there in the first place, and when exactly they became optional? Lets dig into the archaeology of the early web and trace how this ubiquitous prefix went from essential to obsolete.\nWhere Did You Go?\nThe first website didnt bother with any of that www. nonsense!

To understand why, we need only contemplate the very first website, created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990. Running on a NeXT workstation employed as a server, the site could be accessed at a simple URL: http//info.cern.ch/\u2014no WWW needed. Berners-Lee had invented the World Wide Web, and called it as such, but he hadnt included the prefix in his URL at all. So where did it come from?\nMcDonalds were ahead of the times  in 1999, their website featured the mcdonalds.com domain, no prefix, though you did need it to actually get to the site.

It had become typical to separate out different services on a domain by using subdomains. For example, a company might have FTP access on http://ftp.company.com, while the SMTP server would be accessed via the smpt.company.com subdomain. In turn, when it came to establish a server to run a World Wide Web page, network administrators followed existing convention. Thus, they would put the WWW server on the www. subdomain, creating http://www.company.com.\nThis soon became standard practice, and in short order, was expected by members of the broader public as the joined the Internet in the late 1990s. It wasnt long before end users were ignoring the http:// prefix at the start of domains, as web browsers didnt really need you to type that in. However, www. had more of a foothold in the public consciousness. Along with .com, it became an obvious way for companies to highlight their new fancy website in their public facing marketing materials. For many years, this was simply how things were done. Users expected to type www before a domain name, and thus it became an ingrained part of the culture.\nEventually, though, trends shifted. For many domains, web traffic was the sole dominant use, so it became somewhat unnecessary to fold web traffic under its own subdomain. There was also a technological shift when the HTTP/1.1 protocol was introduced in 1999, with the Host header enabling multiple domains to be hosted on a single server. This, along with tweaks to DNS, also made it trivial to ensure www.yoursite.com and yoursite.com went to the same place. Beyond that, fashion-forward companies started dropping the leading www. for a cleaner look in marketing. Eventually, this would become the norm, with www. soon looking old hat.\nVisit microsoft.com in Chrome, and you might think thats where you really are Credit: author screenshot\nOf course, today, www is mostly dying out, at least as far as the industry and most end users are concerned. Few of us spend much time typing in URLs by hand these days, and fewer of us could remember the last time we felt the need to include www. at the beginning. Of course, if you want to make your business look out of touch, you could still include www. on your marketing materials, but people might think youre an old fuddy duddy.\nbut youre not! Click in the address bar, and Chrome will show you the real URL. www. and all. Embarrassing! Credit: author screenshot\nHackaday, though? We rock without the prefix. Cutting-edge out here, folks. Credit: author screenshot\nUsing the www. prefix can still have some value when it comes to cookies, however. If you\u00a0dont use the prefix and someone goes to yoursite.com, that cookie would be sent to all subdomains. However, if your main page is set up at http://www.yoursite.com, its effectively on its own subdomain, along with any others you might have like store.yoursite.com, blog.yoursite.com, and so on. This allows cookies to be more effectively managed across a site spanning multiple subdomains.\nIn any case, most browsers have taken a stance against the significance of www. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge all hide the prefix even when you are technically visiting a website that does still use the www. subdomain (like http://www.microsoft.com). You can try it yourself in Chrome\u2014head over to a www. site and watch as the prefix disappears from the taskbar. If you really want to know if youre on a www subdomain or not, though, you can click into the taskbar and it will give you the full URL, HTTP:// or HTTPS:// included, and all.\nThe www prefix stands as a reminder that the internet is a living, evolving thing. Over time, technical necessities become conventions, conventions become habits, and habits eventually fade away when they no longer serve a purpose. Yet we still see those three letters pop up on the Web now and then, a digital vestigial organ from the early days of the web. The next time you mindlessly type a URL without those three Ws, spare a thought for this small piece of internet history that shaped how we access information for decades. Largely gone, but not yet quite forgotten.\n"}

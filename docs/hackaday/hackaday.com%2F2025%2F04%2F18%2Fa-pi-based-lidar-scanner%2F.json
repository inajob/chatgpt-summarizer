These systems use a rapid succession of laser pulses over a wide area to create an accurate 3D map. Early LiDAR systems were cumbersome and expensive but as the march of time continues on, these systems have become much more accessible to the average person. So much so that you can quickly attach one to a Raspberry Pi and perform LiDAR imaging for a very reasonable cost.\nThis software suite is a custom serial driver and scanning system for the Raspberry Pi, designed to work with LDRobot LiDAR modules like the LD06, LD19, and STL27L. Although still in active development, it offers an impressive set of features: real-time 2D visualizations, vertex color extraction, generation of 360-degree panoramic maps using fisheye camera images, and export capabilities for integration with other tools. The hardware setup includes a stepper motor for quick full-area scanning, and power options that include either a USB battery bank or a pair of 18650 lithium cells\u2014making the system portable and self-contained during scans.\nLiDAR systems are quickly becoming a dominant player for anything needing to map out or navigate a complex 3D space, from self-driving cars to small Arduino-powered robots. The capabilities a system like this brings are substantial for a reasonable cost, and we expect to see more LiDAR modules in other hardware as the technology matures further.\nThanks to [Dirk] for the tip!", "title": "- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080LiDAR\u306b\u3088\u308b3D\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "body": "LiDAR\u306f3D\u7a7a\u9593\u306e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u5229\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi\u3067\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3080LiDAR\u306b\u3088\u308b3D\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0", "- LDRobot LiDAR\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3068Raspberry Pi\u306e\u9023\u643a\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306aLiDAR\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u304b\u3089\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u307e\u3067\uff01LiDAR\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u4e8b\u4f8b", "- LiDAR\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff"]}

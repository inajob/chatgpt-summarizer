Yet even Colossal Cave Adventure has recently got a refresh in the form of a 3D graphical version, which has led [Bryan Lunduke] to take a look at how to best revisit the original text adventure.\nYour Colossal Cave Adventure awaits (Credit: Bryan Lunduke)\nFor those who are on Linux or a BSD system, the easiest way is to hop over to the package manager and install Colossal Cave Adventure straight away with the package bsdgames on Debian-based systems, or colossal-cave-adventure on others. A port by Eric S. Raymond of the 1995 version of the game can also be found as Open Adventure, and theres a 1990-era DOS version you can experience on real hardware or even in a browser window, if thats your thing. Or get it for your Amiga, Macintosh or OS/2. These days you can even get ready-to-use maps of the entire cave and surroundings, which along with walkthroughs can make things far too easy.\nAs for the newly released version of the game, its available on the usual store outlets, including GoG, and reviews of the game do seem to appreciate that it is essentially a like-for-like translation of the texture adventure into a graphical one. As for whether a nearly-half-a-century old game holds up to scrutiny by sticking to what worked when Dungeons  Dragons was still the new kid on the block and systems like the PDP-10 ruled the roost, this is very much debatable, but one has to have respect for a game that has stuck around for so long, across so many system architectures and programming languages. Plus it also gave us Zork.\n(Thanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip)", "title": "\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f3D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u767b\u5834", "body": "1976\u5e74\u306bWilliam Crowther\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u9759\u304b\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305fColossal Cave Adventure\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5192\u967a\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671b\u3080\u6d1e\u7a9f\u63a2\u691c\u306e\u60c5\u71b1\u304b\u3089\u751f\u307e\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u308c\u304c\u4e00\u90e8\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u3001\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u73fe\u5728\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u73fe\u5b9f\u7684\u306a\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u5192\u967a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u3067\u306f3D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u7248\u3082\u767b\u5834\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306e\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u518d\u8a2a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001Bryan Lunduke\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b\u304b\u898b\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u306e\u65b0\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f3D\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u767b\u5834", "\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u306e\u653b\u7565\u6cd5", "1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eDOS\u7248\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u3092\u5b9f\u6a5f\u3067\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046", "Linux\u3084BSD\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u304c\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u53ef\u80fd", "\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u5de8\u5927\u306a\u6d1e\u7a9f\u306e\u5192\u967a\u300d\u304c\u307e\u3060\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u7406\u7531"]}

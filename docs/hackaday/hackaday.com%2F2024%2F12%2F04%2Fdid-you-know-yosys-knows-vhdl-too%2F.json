Very cool!\nVerilog and VHDL are kind of like the C and ADA of the FPGA world. Verilog will seem familiar to you if you\u2019re used to writing code for computers. For instance, it will turn integer variables into wires that carry the binary values for you. VHDL code looks odd from a software programmer\u2019s perspective because it\u2019s closer to the hardware and strongly typed: an 8-bit integer isn\u2019t the same as eight wires in VHDL. VHDL is a bigger jump if you have software in your brain, but it\u2019s also a lot closer to describing how the hardware actually works.\nWe learned Verilog, because it\u2019s what Yosys supported. But thanks to GHDL, a VHDL analyzer and synthesizer, and the yosys-ghdl-plugin, you can write your logic in VHDL too. Does this put an end to the FPGA-language holy wars? Thanks, Yosys.\n[Michael] points out that this isn\u2019t really news, because the oss-cad-suite install has been doing this for a while now, but like him, it was news to us, and we thought we\u2019d share it with you all.\nWant to get started with FPGAs and the open-source toolchain?

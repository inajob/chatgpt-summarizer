Whether its to effect a repair, make a modification, or just to take a look around, voiding warranties is what we do. A lot of us have hard limits, though, and will shy away from certain types of equipment. High voltages and radiation come to mind, as well as machines with lots of spinny bits that can devour your hands in a trice. One mustnt be foolhardy, after all.\nBut one place that weve always feared to tread for some reason is camera equipment. Perhaps it has to do with all those impossibly tiny screws with subtly different lengths and the knowledge that putting the wrong screw in the wrong hole could have disastrous results. Or maybe its just the general fear that messing around with the insides of lenses could knock something slightly off-kilter and ruin the optics.\nWere certainly glad that Anthony Kouttron doesnt share this trepidation. We recently featured a lens repair that he accomplished that was packed with tips and tricks for optical repairs. It turns out that Anthony has been repairing cameras for leisure since 2010, and has serviced both consumer and high-end cinema equipment  so hes seen his fair share of broken camera bits. Weve asked him to drop by the Hack Chat, so if youve been hesitant to dive into optical fixes, now might be your chance to learn about the dos and donts of camera and lens repair.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the\u00a0Hackaday.io\u00a0Hack Chat group messaging. This week we\u2019ll be sitting down on Wednesday, May 29 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have you tied up, we have a handy time zone converter.", "title": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30af\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8", "body": "5\u670829\u65e5\u306e\u6b63\u5348\u3001\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6642\u9593\u306b\u300c\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u300d\u304c\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u6016\u308c\u308b\u4eba\u3082\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001Anthony Kouttron\u306f2010\u5e74\u304b\u3089\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u8da3\u5473\u3068\u3057\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30b3\u30c4\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002Hack Chat\u306fHackaday.io\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u3001\u53c2\u52a0\u8005\u306f\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3084\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30ce\u30a6\u30cf\u30a6\u3092\u5b66\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30f3\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30af\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30f3\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5b66\u3076\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u6a5f\u6750\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "\u9ad8\u3044\u6280\u8853\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u6a5f\u6750\u4fee\u7406", "\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u767b\u5834", "\u5149\u5b66\u4fee\u7406\u306eDos\u3068Donts\u3092\u5b66\u3076"]}

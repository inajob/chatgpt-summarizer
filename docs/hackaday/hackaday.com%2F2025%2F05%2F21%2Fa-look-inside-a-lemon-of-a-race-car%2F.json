This is all the more true of 24 hour endurance races where teams tag team to get the most laps of a circuit in over a 24 hour period. The format pushes cars and drivers to the very limit. Doing so on a $500 budget as presented by the 24 hours of Lemons makes this all the more impressive!\nOf course, racing on a $500 budget is difficult to say the least. All the expected F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) safety requirements are still in place, including roll cage, seats and fire extinguisher. However, brakes, wheels, tires and safety equipment are not factored into the cost of the car, which is good because an FIA racing seat can run well in excess of the budget. Despite the name, most races are twelve to sixteen hours across two days, but 24 hour endurance races are run. The very limiting budget and amateur nature of the event has created a large amount of room for teams to get creative with car restorations and race car builds.\n\nThe 24 Hours of Le-MINES Team and their 1990 Miata\nOne such team we had the chance of speaking to goes by the name 24 Hours of Le-Mines. Their build is a wonderful mishmash of custom fabrication and affordable parts. Its built from a restored 1999 NA Miata complete with rusted frame and all! Power is handled by a rebuilt 302 Mustang engine of indeterminate age.\nThe stock Miata brakes seem rather small for a race car, but are plenty for a car of its weight. Suspension is an Amazon special because it only has to work for 24 hours. The boot lid (or trunk if you prefer) is held down with what look to be over-sized RC car pins. Nestled next to the PVC pipe inlet pipe is a nitrous oxide canister  we dont know if its functional or for show, but we like it nonetheless. The scrappy look is completed with a portion of the road sign fabricated into a shifter cover.\nThe team is unsure if the car will end up racing, but odds are if you are reading Hackaday, you care more about the race cars then the actual racing. Regardless, we hope to see this Miata in the future!\nThis is certainly not the first time we have covered 24 hour endurance engineering, like this solar powered endurance plane.", "title": "- 500\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "500\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226\u3067\u3001\u5275\u610f\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u6c42\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306f1999\u5e74\u5f0f\u30df\u30a2\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u6539\u9020\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- 500\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 24\u6642\u9593\u8010\u4e45\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30df\u30a2\u30bf\u306e\u518d\u751f\u3068\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0", "- DIY\u7cbe\u795e\u65fa\u76db\uff01\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u88cf\u5074", "- \u5275\u610f\u5de5\u592b\u304c\u30ab\u30ae\uff01\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u88fd\u4f5c", "- 24\u6642\u9593\u8010\u4e45\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u918d\u9190\u5473\u3068\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u596e\u95d8\u8a18"]}

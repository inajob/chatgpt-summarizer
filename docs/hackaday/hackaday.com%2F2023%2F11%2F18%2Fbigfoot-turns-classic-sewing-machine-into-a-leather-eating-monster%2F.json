Most machines are built for speed, and trying to get them to punch through heavy material at the low motor speeds often needed for leather work is a lesson in frustration.\nHow frustrating? Enough so that [Joseph Eoff] expended considerable effort to create this sewing machine speed controller for his nearly century-old Adler sewing machine. The machine was once powered by a foot treadle, which is probably why the project is dubbed Bigfoot, but now uses a 230 V universal motor. Such motors dont deliver much torque when run at low speeds with the standard foot-pedal rheostat control, so [Joseph] worked up an Arduino-based controller with a tachometer for feedback and a high-power PWM driver for the motor.\nThere are a ton of details in [Joseph]s post and even more in the original blog article, which is well worth a read, but a couple really stand out. The first is with the tachometer, which uses an off-the-shelf photointerrupter and slotted disc. [Joseph] was displeased with the sensors asymmetrical and unreliable output, so he made some modifications to the onboard comparator to square up the signal. Also interesting is the PID loop auto-tuning function he programmed into Bigfoot; press a button and the controller automatically ramps the motor speed up and down and stores the coefficients in memory. Nice!\nThe short video below shows Bigfoot in action with varying thicknesses of faux leather; there are also some clips in the original article that show the machine dealing with a triple thickness of leather at slow speed and not even breaking a sweat. Hats off to [Joseph] on a solid build that keeps a classic machine in the game. And if you want to get into the textile arts but dont know where to start, weve got you covered.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30a2\u30c9\u30e9\u30fc\u88fd\u30df\u30b7\u30f3\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u5236\u5fa1\u88c5\u7f6e\u3001\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u304c\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "body": "One maker created a sewing machine speed controller for his century-old Adler machine.

A nice workaround is presented by [PocketBoy], in converting an acoustic kit to electronic operation so you can play with headphones instead.\nA sensor installed inside a floor tom.\nIt might sound like a complicated project, but creating a basic set of electronic drums can actually be quite simple if youve already got an acoustic kit. You just need to damp all the drums and cymbals to make them quieter, and then fit all the individual elements with their own piezo sensors. These are basically small discs that can pick up vibrations and turn them into electricity\u2014which can be used to trigger an electronic drum module.\n[PocketBoy]s build started with a PDP New Yorker kit, some mesh heads to dull the snares and toms, and some low-volume cymbals sourced off Amazon. Each drum got a small piezo element, which was soldered to a 6.5mm jack for easy hookup. Theyre installed inside the drums on foam squares with a simple bracket system [PocketBoy] whipped up from hardware store parts. A DDrum DDti interface picks up the signals from the piezo elements and sends commands to an attached PC. Its paired with Ableton 12 Lite, which plays the drum sounds as triggered by the drummer.\n[PocketBoy] notes its a quick and dirty setup, good for quiet practice but not quite gig-ready. Youd want to probably just run it as a regular acoustic kit in that context, but theres nothing about the conversion that prevents that. Ultimately, its a useful project if you find yourself needing to practice the drums quietly and you dont have space for a second electric-only kit. Theres lots of other fun you can have with those piezos, too. Video after the break.\n\n\n @the606queer \nHow I\u2019m getting away with a drumset in an apartment building! Mesh heads + DIY triggers + Plain wash cloth + Stick Rods + DDTI DDrum Trigger i/o into Ableton. I need a better snare sample but this thing is whisper quiet! #drums #beginner #acoustics #fyp #drumtok \n \u266c original sound  the606queer \n\n ", "title": "\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u3057\u3001\u9759\u304b\u306b\u7df4\u7fd2\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u3059\u308b\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3067\u9759\u304b\u306b\u7df4\u7fd2\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30d4\u30a8\u30be\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "\u30a2\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u3082\u7df4\u7fd2\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u9759\u304b\u306a\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u96fb\u5b50\u30c9\u30e9\u30e0\u5909\u63db\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306a\u7df4\u7fd2\u74b0\u5883\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01"]}

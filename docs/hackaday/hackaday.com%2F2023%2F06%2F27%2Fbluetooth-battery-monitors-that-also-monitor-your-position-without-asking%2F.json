After connecting them up to the battery, you download the accompanying app on your smartphone, open it up and like magic you can keep tabs on your precious pile of chemistry that keeps things ticking along. Yet as [haxrob] discovered during an analysis, many of these devices will happily pass your location and other information along to remote servers.\nThe device in question is a Bluetooth 4.0 Battery Monitor that is resold under many brands, and which by itself would seem to do just what it is said to do, from monitoring a battery to running crank tests. Where things get unpleasant is with the Battery Monitor 2 (BM2) mobile app that accompanies the device. It integrates a library called AMap which is a leading provider of digital map in China and part of Alibaba. Although the apps information page claims that no personal information is collected, the data intercepted with Wireshark would beg to differ.\nIn part 2 of this series, the BM2 app is reverse-engineered, decompiling the Java code. The personal information includes the latitude and longitude, as well as GPS, cell phone tower cell IDs and WiFi beacon data, which understandably has people rather upset. In addition to leaking your personal info, the BM2 app seems to be also good at running constantly in the background, which ironically drains your phones battery at an alarming rate.\nCases like these should be both a warning to not just install any app on your smartphone, as well as a wake-up call to Google and others to prevent such blatant privacy violations.\n(Thanks to [Drew] for the tip)", "title": "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b", "body": "Bluetooth\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u72b6\u614b\u3092\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u5e38\u306b\u7a3c\u50cd\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6025\u901f\u306b\u6d88\u8017\u3055\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u4e8b\u4f8b\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u4e0d\u6b63\u306a\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u8b66\u544a\u3059\u308b\u3068\u540c\u6642\u306b\u3001Google\u306a\u3069\u306b\u660e\u767d\u306a\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fb5\u5bb3\u3092\u9632\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u547c\u3073\u304b\u3051\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u9001\u4fe1\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b", "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b94.0\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u554f\u984c", "BM2\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u6025\u901f\u306b\u6d88\u8017\u3059\u308b", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u4fb5\u5bb3\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u8b66\u544a\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u559a\u8d77", "\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u306eBM2\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u304c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u60c5\u5831\u3068\u500b\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u6f0f\u6d29"]}

With that out of the way, when we need a tube like that, we usually think of PVC or some other kind of pipe product. Or maybe well 3D print what we need. But not [GregO29]. He made his tubes from plywood.\nYou can make tubes as small as 12 inches in diameter, and [GregO29] made some that were 16 inches. The first step was to make a mold or form. In this case, he elected to make a form that the tube-to-be wraps around. The plywood is thin 2-ply white birch. This makes it easy to shape.\nThe basic idea is to wrap the wood around the form and glue it. You hold it together with a strap until it dries. Then, you can add more layers until it is the thickness you need.\nThe real problem turned out to be removing the form once it was done. Why make a tube like this? In [Greg]s case, hes building a telescope, which is as good a reason as any to have a tube, we suppose.\nWe build a lot of things, but we always forget about plywood. It even mixes well with electricity."}

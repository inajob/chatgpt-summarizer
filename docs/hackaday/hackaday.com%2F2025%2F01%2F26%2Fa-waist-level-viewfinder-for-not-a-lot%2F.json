It doesnt have to be that way though, and [Snappiness] is here to get you started on the route to cheaper kit with a waist-level viewfinder project.\nIf youve used a twin-lens reflex camera then you should be familiar with a waist level viewfinder, its a lens and mirror arrangement allowing the photographer to frame the shot looking down from above. Modern cameras often have no viewfinder, so this is aimed at digital compacts without flip-up screens.\nIt has three components, all available for relatively low prices, and mounted in a 3D printed case. Theres a prime lens, a mirror, and a Fresnel lens forming the part the photographer looks through. Its a simple device, but still one which would cost a lot more off the shelf. The video is below the break.\nIt might interest you to know that this is not the first viewfinder project weve brought you for digital cameras.\n\n"}

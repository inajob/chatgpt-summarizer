Did you know, though, that there are some robots in that book? Guinness pointed some out in a recent post.\nEver wonder about the longest table-tennis rally with a robot or the fastest robotic cube solver? No need to wonder anymore.\nOur favorite was the fastest robot to solve a puzzle cube. This robot solved the Rubiks Cube in 103 milliseconds! Dont blink or youll miss it in the video embedded. Of course, the real kudos go to the team that created the robot: [Matthew Patrohay], [Junpei Ota], [Aden Hurd], and [Alex Berta].\nAnother favorite was the smallest humanoid robot. In order to win this record, the robot must be able to move its shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips just like a human. It also has to be able to walk on two feet. This tiny little guy meets the requirements and stands only 57.6 mm (2.26 in) tall! Created by [Tatsuhiko Mitsuya] in April 2024, this robot can be controlled via Bluetooth.\nWeve seen entries in this category before  check them out in Almost Breaking The World Record For The Tiniest Humanoid Robot, But Not Quite.\n\n", "title": "- \u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u305f\u3061\uff1a\u30ae\u30cd\u30b9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u8a18\u9332", "body": "\u30ae\u30cd\u30b9\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u306b\u767b\u9332\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u6700\u901f\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u89e3\u6cd5\u3084\u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u305f\u3061\uff1a\u30ae\u30cd\u30b9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u65b0\u8a18\u9332", "- 103\u30df\u30ea\u79d2\u3067\u30eb\u30fc\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u89e3\u304f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u6700\u5c0f\u306e\u4eba\u9593\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u300157.6mm\u306e\u5927\u304d\u3055\u3067\u6b69\u884c\u53ef\u80fd", "- \u30d0\u30fc\u8ced\u3051\u3067\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u8a18\u9332\u60c5\u5831", "- \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30b9\u5236\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u6700\u5c0f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u6280\u8853\u89e3\u8aac"]}

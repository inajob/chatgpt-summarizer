Do know what it is? Let us know, and if youre right and your number comes up, you can keep warm in a limited edition Hackaday Podcast t-shirt.\nThen its on to the hacks and such beginning with a rather nice reverse-engineering of the Yamaha PRS-E433 keyboard, which led to a slice of Bad Apple playing on the tiny screen.\nAfter that, we take a look at an NES musical instrument, how to make wires explode with energy, and a really cool space mouse that uses flexures. Finally, we talk about a piece of forgotten Internet history, and a whole bunch of keyboards.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 305 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nBambu Lab Tries To Clarify Its New \u201cBeta\u201d Authentication Scheme\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nKnow what this weeks sound is?\u00a0 Let us know for your chance at a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nShellcode Over MIDI?

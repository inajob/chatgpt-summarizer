There are better screens, better headsets, and better steering wheels with better force-feedback, all of which help make you feel like youre driving the real thing. If youre looking for a stick shifter to complete such a setup, [DAZ Projects] might have just what youre looking for.\u00a0\nTo create a robust shifter with great feel, the build relies on 3D printed parts as well as lots of quality metal hardware. At the heart of the build is a linear rail for the front-to-back movement, with a printed slider on top with a carefully-profiled indexer to ensure the stick properly ca-chunks into the right gear. A ball joint locates the shift lever itself, while allowing for smooth movement left-to-right. Centering is via simple extension springs. The H-pattern shift is enforced with machined steel rods. Detecting the position of the stick is handled via microswitches, with an Arduino Leonardo reading the switches and reporting itself as a USB device that should work with any modern sim.\nIts funny to think that such a mechanism would once have been a very serious machining job. These days, you can just squirt all this stuff out on a printer in a few hours. For the parts that cant be extruded, [DAZ Projects] has provided a parts list on Google Docs.\nWeve featured some great racing sim builds over the years, from button pads to pedal boxes.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b7\u30e0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u6700\u8fd1\u306e\u30b7\u30e0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001DAZ Projects\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u91d1\u5c5e\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b7\u30e0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u91d1\u5c5e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u30b7\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u69cb\u9020", "- Arduino\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30d5\u30c8\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u30dd\u30b8\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u691c\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306eH\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30b7\u30e0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u6a5f\u6750\u304c\u5230\u7740\uff01"]}

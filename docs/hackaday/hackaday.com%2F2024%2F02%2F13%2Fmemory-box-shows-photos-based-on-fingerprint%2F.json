After doing some sketching, [Mike] arrived at the idea to make a memory box uses a fingerprint scanner to show different pictures based on the fingerprint.\n[Mike] started by rendering the box in Blender and then cutting a sizeable hole in the lid for the E-ink screen. Thats around the time the first problem came up  there were weird vertical lines in the display. Sure enough, that screen was broken. Then he added the SD card reader, but the SD card wouldnt work, and was heating up besides. Finally, the fingerprint scanner was causing issues, but it turned out that the power supply was at fault.\nAfter all of that, [Mike] switched from an ESP32to a Raspi Zero W to simplify the whole process of finding a photo tagged with the persons fingerprint. [Mike] added a Python script that listens for new memories over Wi-Fi. A memory in this case consists of a picture, a description, a list of people tagged in the picture, and some additional metadata.\nOne important lesson [Mike] learned was that of balancing planning vs. just taking action. If he had taken the time to consider the complexity of the tagged-photo retrieval system, he would have arrived at an SBC solution much sooner. Be sure to check out the build video after the break.\nYou can have all sorts of fun with fingerprint scanners, like this one that opens a secret bookcase door.\n\n", "title": "\u300c\u6307\u7d0b\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "body": "\u606f\u5b50\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\u306b\u4f55\u304b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u305fMike\u306f\u3001\u6307\u7d0b\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u6307\u7d0b\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u7570\u306a\u308b\u5199\u771f\u3092\u8868\u793a\u3059\u308b\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6700\u521d\u306f\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u306e\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u306b\u306fRaspi Zero W\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u6307\u7d0b\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30ca\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u50b7\u3064\u3051\u81ea\u751f\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u8a18\u61b6\u4fdd\u5b58\u88c5\u7f6e\u300d", "\u300c\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u5bfe\u51e6\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u300d", "\u300c\u5199\u771f\u3092\u7d10\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u6307\u7d0b\u3067\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u300d"]}

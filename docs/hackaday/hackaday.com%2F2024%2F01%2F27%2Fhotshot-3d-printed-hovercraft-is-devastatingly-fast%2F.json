[ValRC] demonstrates just that with a hovercraft build that is surprisingly nimble, and fast to boot.\nThe build started with a design [ValRC] found online. It was simple enough to print and assemble, needing only a pair of a brushless motors, a speed controller, a receiver, and a servo to run the show. The design uses a plastic bag as a skirt, assembled around a 3D printed frame. That proved to be the hardest part of the build, as hot glue didnt want to play nice with the thin garbage bag.\nEven despite the challenges, once assembled, the hovercraft performed well. It readily slid around on a cushion of air, drifting across asphalt with abandon. Upgrades included a better rudder and a skirt made of thicker and more resilient plastic.\u00a0 The final craft looked mesmerizing as it glided over the smooth concrete of a parking garage with ease.\nA hovercraft is, honestly, one of the cooler printable projects for beginners. All you need is a simple design, some powerful motors, and youre good to go.\n\n"}

This follows a recent AI slop incident where someone submitted a massive patch to the Mesa project with the claim that this would improve performance by a few percent. The catch? The entire patch was generated by ChatGPT, with the submitter becoming somewhat irate when the very patient Mesa developers tried to explain that theyd happily look at the issue after the submitter had condensed the purported improvement into a bite-sized patch.\nThe entire saga is summarized in a recent video by [Brodie Robertson] which highlights both how incredibly friendly the Mesa developers are, and how the use of ChatGPT and kin has made some people with zero programming skills apparently believe that they can now contribute code to OSS projects. Unsurprisingly, the Mesa developers were unable to disabuse this particular individual from that notion, but the diff to the Mesa contributor guide by [Timur Krist\u00f3f] should make abundantly clear that someone playing Telephone between a chatbot and OSS project developers is neither desirable nor helpful.\nThat said, [Brodie] also highlights a recent post by [Daniel Stenberg] of Curl fame, who thanked [Joshua Rogers] for contributing a massive list of potential issues that were found using AI-assisted tools, as detailed in this blog post by [Joshua]. An important point here is that these AI tools are not LLM-based chatbots, but rather tweaked existing tools like static code analyzers with more smarts bolted on. Theyre purpose-made tools that still require you to know what youre doing, but they can be a real asset to a developer, and a heck of a lot more useful to a project like Curl than getting sent fake bug reports by a confabulating chatbot as has happened previously.\n\n"}

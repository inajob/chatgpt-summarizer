Recently, hes created a hardware CPU monitor that allows him to see how well his PC is parallelizing compile tasks at a glance. The monitor is built from 14 analog meters, along with some WS2812 RGB LEDs.\nEach meter represents a core on [Lex]s CPU, while the final two meters show memory and swap usage. The meters themselves are low-cost 5 mA devices. Of course, the original milliamps legends wouldnt do much good, so [Lex] designed and printed graduations that glue over the top. The RGB LED strip is positioned so two LEDs fit under each meter. The LEDs allow a splash of color to draw attention to the current state of the machine. The whole bank going red would sure get our attention!\nThe system is controlled by an Arduino Mega, with the meters driven using the PWM pins. The only extra part is a 1 K resistor. The Arduino wrangles the LEDs as well. Sadly [Lex] did not include his software. He did describe it though. Basically hes using a Rust program to call systemstat, obtaining the current CPU utilization data in Linux. A bit of math converts this into pointer values and LED colors. The data is then sent via USB-serial to the Arduino Mega. The software savvy will say its pretty easy to replicate, but the hardware only hackers among us might need a bit of help.\nThis isnt the first custom meter weve seen on Hackaday. Your authors first project covered by Hackaday was for a meter created using an automotive gauge stepper motor. I didnt include source code either  but only because\u00a0[Guy Carpenter]\u2019s\u00a0Switec X25 library had me covered.\n\n\nThanks for the tip, [TubeTime]!"}

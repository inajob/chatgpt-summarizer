It stands to reason that with an SDR and GNU Radio, you could send and receive Meshtastic messages. Thats exactly what [Josh Conway] built, and you can see a video about the project, Meshtastic_SDR, below. The video is from [cemaxecuter], who puts the library through its paces.\nFor hardware, the video uses a Canary I as well as the WarDragon software-defined radio kit which is an Airspy R2 and a mini PC running Dragon OS  a Linux distribution aimed at SDR work \u00a0 in a rugged case. GNU Radio, of course, uses flows which are really just Python modules strung together with a GUI.\n\nThe GNU blocks send and receive data via TCP port, so using the radio as a data connection is simple enough. The flow graph itself for the receiver looks daunting, but we have a feeling you wont change the default very much.\nIf youve wanted to dip your toe into Meshtastic or you want a meaty example of using GNU Radio, this would be a fun project to duplicate and extend. While Meshtastic is generally a mesh protocol, you can set up a node to act as a repeater. You never know when decentralized communications might save the day.\n"}

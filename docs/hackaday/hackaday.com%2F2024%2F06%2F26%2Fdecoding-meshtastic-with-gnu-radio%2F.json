It stands to reason that with an SDR and GNU Radio, you could send and receive Meshtastic messages. Thats exactly what [Josh Conway] built, and you can see a video about the project, Meshtastic_SDR, below. The video is from [cemaxecuter], who puts the library through its paces.\nFor hardware, the video uses a Canary I as well as the WarDragon software-defined radio kit which is an Airspy R2 and a mini PC running Dragon OS  a Linux distribution aimed at SDR work \u00a0 in a rugged case. GNU Radio, of course, uses flows which are really just Python modules strung together with a GUI.\n\nThe GNU blocks send and receive data via TCP port, so using the radio as a data connection is simple enough. The flow graph itself for the receiver looks daunting, but we have a feeling you wont change the default very much.\nIf youve wanted to dip your toe into Meshtastic or you want a meaty example of using GNU Radio, this would be a fun project to duplicate and extend. While Meshtastic is generally a mesh protocol, you can set up a node to act as a repeater. You never know when decentralized communications might save the day.\n", "title": "Meshtastic\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u901a\u4fe1", "body": "Meshtastic\u306fLoRa\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30bb\u30eb\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u3084\u30db\u30c3\u30c8\u30b9\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u5f93\u6765\u306e\u4e2d\u7d99\u5668\u306b\u306f\u4f9d\u5b58\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002SDR\u3068GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066Meshtastic\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3001[Josh Conway]\u304c\u305d\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["Meshtastic\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u69cb\u7bc9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u901a\u4fe1", "SDR\u3068GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Meshtastic\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u3092\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "Canary I\u3068WarDragon\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fMeshtastic_SDR\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "GNU Radio\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066Meshtastic\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\u9001\u53d7\u4fe1\u3092\u8a66\u3059\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u5206\u6563\u578b\u901a\u4fe1\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308bMeshtastic\u306e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068GNURadio\u306e\u6d3b\u7528"]}

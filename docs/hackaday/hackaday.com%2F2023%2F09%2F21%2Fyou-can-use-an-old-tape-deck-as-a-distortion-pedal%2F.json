As a youth, [David Hilowitz] couldnt afford a loud aggressive amp, a distortion pedal, or even a proper electric guitar. This experience ended up teaching him that you can use random old audio hardware as a distortion effect.\n[Davids] guitar journey started when he found a classical guitar on a dumpster. He learned to play, but longed for the sound of a proper electric guitar. Family friends gifted him a solitary pickup, intending he build a guitar, but he simply duct-taped it to his steel-strung classical instead. The only thing he lacked was an amp. He made do with an old stereo system and a record pre-amp. With his his faux-electric guitar plugged into the microphone input, he was blessed with a rudimentary but pleasant distortion that filled his heart with joy.\n[David] goes on to explain the concepts behind distorted guitar sounds, and how his home hi-fi was able to serve as a passable starter amp when he was young and couldnt afford better. He then goes on the hunt for more old gear at a local Goodwill store, finding a neat old tape deck that similarly produced some nice warm distorted tones. In [Davids] experience, old hi-fi gear with microphone inputs can generally do a decent job in this role, with electric guitar pickups typically overloading the preamps which expect a lower-level signal. Its different to what youd get from a Big Muff or Boss DS-1, but its a neat sound nonetheless.\nWeve looked at distortion effects before, including rolling your own and putting it into production. Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u6614\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52b9\u679c", "body": "\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6b6a\u307f\u97f3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6b6a\u307f\u52b9\u679c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u3067\u3082\u6696\u304b\u3044\u6b6a\u307f\u97f3\u304c\u51fa\u305b\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u6614\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u52b9\u679c", "\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u79d8\u8a23\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30af\u54c1\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u53e4\u3044\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306a\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u5165\u529b\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u72ec\u7279\u306a\u6b6a\u307f\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9", "\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30de\u30d5\u3084\u30dc\u30b9DS-1\u3068\u306f\u4e00\u7dda\u3092\u753b\u3059\u3001\u7279\u5225\u306a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9"]}

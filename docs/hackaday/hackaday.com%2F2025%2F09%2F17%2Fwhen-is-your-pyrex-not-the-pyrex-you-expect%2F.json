If you know anything about Pyrex its probably that its the glass youll see in laboratories and many pieces of cookware, and its special trick is that it can handle high temperatures. The video takes a look at this, and reveals that not all Pyrex is the same.\nPyrex was a Corning product from the early 20th century, and aside from its many laboratory and industrial applications has been the go-to brand for casserole dishes and much more in the kitchen ever since. Its a borosilicate glass, which is what gives it the special properties, or at least in some cases it used to be a borosilicate glass. It seems that modern-day American Pyrex for the kitchen is instead a soda glass, which while it still makes a fine pie dish, doesnt quite have the properties of the original.\nThe video explains some of the differences, as well as revealing that the American version is branded in lower case as pyrex while the European version is branded uppercase as PYREX and retains the borosilicate formulation. Frustratingly theres no quick way to definitively tell whether a piece of lower-case pyrex is soda glass or not, because the brand switch happened before the formulation switch.\nIn all probability in the kitchen it makes little difference which version you own, because most users wont give it the extreme thermal shock required to break the soda version. But some Hackaday readers do plenty of experiments pushing the limits of their glassware, so its as well to know that seeking out an older PYREX dish could be a good move.\nIf youd like to know more about glass, weve got you covered.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01Pyrex\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "body": "Pyrex\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3057\u305f\u52d5\u753b\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3082\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\uff01Pyrex\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u300d", "- \u300cPyrex\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\uff1a\u9ad8\u6e29\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306e\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u9055\u3044\u300d", "- \u300c\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u88fdPyrex\u3068\u305d\u306e\u7279\u6027\u306e\u5909\u5316\u300d", "- \u300c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304d\u305f\u3044\uff01Pyrex\u306e\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u9055\u3044\u3068\u5f71\u97ff\u300d", "- \u300c\u5b9f\u9a13\u597d\u304d\u5fc5\u898b\uff01Pyrex\u9078\u3073\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u6ce8\u610f\u70b9\u300d"]}

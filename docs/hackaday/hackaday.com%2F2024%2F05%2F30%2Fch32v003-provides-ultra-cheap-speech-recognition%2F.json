Just how modest, you ask? How about a 10 cent microcontroller?\n[Brian Smith] has achieved a very basic form of speech recognition on a CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller. It may only recognize spoken digits, but that it does so at all on such a modest platform is impressive in itself.\nFor training purposes it enlists the help of a desktop Linux computer, however the recognition process is purely in the ten cent chip. He goes into much detail about how it achieves this on a system without floating point arithmetic, as well as the other shortcomings of such a limited platform.\nWeve become used to thinking of super-cheap chips as of limited use, but the truth is theyre surprisingly more capable than expected. Were seeing them starting to appear as subsidiary processors on some badges, so it will be interesting to see them proliferate in more projects now their availability problems have eased. Go on  for ten cents, what do you have to lose?", "title": "10\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "body": "10\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3002CH32V003 RISC-V\u3067\u6570\u5b57\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002Linux\u306f\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u7528\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6d6e\u52d5\u5c0f\u6570\u70b9\u6f14\u7b97\u306a\u3057\u3067\u8a8d\u8b58\u51e6\u7406\u3002\u4f4e\u4fa1\u683c\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u610f\u5916\u306a\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6301\u3064\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u5c55\u958b\u3082\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["10\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01", "CH32V003\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\uff01", "10\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u6570\u5b57\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "Linux\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u884c\u304410\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe", "\u9650\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u8a8d\u8b58\u3092\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

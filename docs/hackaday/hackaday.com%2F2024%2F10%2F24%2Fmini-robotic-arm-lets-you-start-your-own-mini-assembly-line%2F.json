[FABRI Creator] has a great tutorial on how to build your own mini robotic arm for small, repeatable tasks.\nWalking us through the entire build, step-by-step, [FABRI Creator] shows us how to populate the custom-designed PCB and where to put every servo motor and potentiometer to bring the creation to life. This seems like a great project to start with if you havent branched out into motion systems before since its a useful build without anything too complicated to trip up the beginner.\nBeyond the usual ability to use the arm to perform tasks, this particular device uses an Arduino Nano to allow you to record a set of positions as you move the arm and to replay it over and over. The video shows the arm putting rings on a stand, but we can think of all kinds of small tasks that it could accomplish for us, letting us get back to writing or hacking.\nIf controlling a robot arm with potentiometers sounds familiar, maybe you remember this robot arm with an arm-shaped controller.\n\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30df\u30cb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "body": "\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u81ea\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u518d\u751f\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5c\u30df\u30cb\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9", "- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Arduino Nano\u3067\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0", "- \u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u3053\u306a\u3059\u81ea\u4f5c\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u306e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b69"]}

So too with the 47-year old Voyager 1 spacecraft and its hydrazine thrusters. Over the decades silicon dioxide from an aging rubber diaphragm in the fuel tank has been depositing on the inside of fuel tubes. By switching between primary, backup and trajectory thrusters the Voyager team has been managing this issue and kept the spacecraft oriented towards Earth. Now this team has performed another amazing feat by reviving the primary thrusters that had been deemed a loss since a heater failure back in 2004.\nUnlike the backup thrusters, the trajectory thrusters do not provide roll control, so reviving the primary thrusters would buy the mission a precious Plan B if the backup thrusters were to fail. Back in 2004 engineers had determined that the heater failure was likely unfixable, but over twenty years later the team was willing to give it another shot. Analyzing the original failure data indicated that a glitch in the heater control circuit was likely to blame, so they might actually still work fine.\nTo test this theory, the team remotely jiggled the heater controls, enabled the primary thrusters and waited for the spacecrafts star tracker to drift off course so that the thrusters would be engaged by the board computer. Making this extra exciting was scheduled maintenance on the Deep Space Network coming up in a matter of weeks, which would troubleshooting impossible for months.\nTo their relief the changes appears to have worked, with the heaters clearly working again, as are the primary thrusters. With this fix in place, it seems that Voyager 1 will be with us for a while longer, even as we face the inevitable end to the amazing Voyager program.", "title": "- \u30f4\u30a9\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u4e3b\u63a8\u9032\u6a5f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a20\u5e74\u306e\u6642\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u3066", "body": "\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30dc\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3002\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u554f\u984c\u89e3\u6c7a\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u3001\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5ef6\u9577\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30f4\u30a9\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u4e3b\u63a8\u9032\u6a5f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff1a20\u5e74\u306e\u6642\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u3066", "- \u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u63a2\u67fb\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\uff1a\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3057\u305f\u71c3\u6599\u7ba1\u306e\u554f\u984c", "- \u30f4\u30a9\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc1\u53f7\u306e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\u305f\u3061\u304c\u6210\u529f\u3055\u305b\u305f\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0", "- \u30d2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u56de\u8def\u306e\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u3092\u767a\u898b\uff1a\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u9375\u3068\u306f", "- \u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u524d\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u63a8\u9032\u6a5f\u306e\u4fee\u5fa9"]}

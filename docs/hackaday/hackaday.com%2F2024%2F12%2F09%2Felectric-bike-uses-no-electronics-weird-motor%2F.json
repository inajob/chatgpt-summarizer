What you get from that combination is simple, efficient transportation. [Tom Stanton] wanted to build an e-bike himself, but he did it without any of the fancy electronic components. But the real gem? The weird janky motor he built to run it.\nThe concept is simple. An e-bike is electric, in that it has an electric motor and a source of electric power. However, [Tom] intended to eliminate the\u00a0electronic\u00a0parts\u2014the speed controller, any battery balancing hardware, and the like. Just think no transistors and microchips and youve got the right idea. Basically, [Tom] just built an e-bike with motor weak enough that it doesnt need any fancy throttle control. He can just turn the motor hard on or off with a switch.\nThe bike is built around a reed switch motor. This uses magnets on a rotor, which interact with a reed switch to time pulses of electricity to coils which drive the motor. [Tom] wound the coils and built the motor from scratch using 3D printed components. The project quickly ran into problems as the reed switch began to suffer degradation from arcing, which [Tom] solved with some innovative tungsten contacts.\nControlling the bike is pretty simple\u2014theres just a switch connecting a capacitor bank to the motor to provide power on command. No electronics! However, [Tom] has also neatly set up the motor to charge a bank of supercapacitors when coasting downhill. In this regard, the bike can store power on a descent and then use it for a boost when required later on. Between the weird motor and the weedy capacitor bank, it doesnt do much, but it does work.\nIf hes looking for a more potent power source, perhaps the answer is already out on the street  in the form of a battery pack salvaged from the cells in discarded vapes.\n\n"}

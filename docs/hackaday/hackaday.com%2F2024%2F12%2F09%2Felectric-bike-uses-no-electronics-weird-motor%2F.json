What you get from that combination is simple, efficient transportation. [Tom Stanton] wanted to build an e-bike himself, but he did it without any of the fancy electronic components. But the real gem? The weird janky motor he built to run it.\nThe concept is simple. An e-bike is electric, in that it has an electric motor and a source of electric power. However, [Tom] intended to eliminate the\u00a0electronic\u00a0parts\u2014the speed controller, any battery balancing hardware, and the like. Just think no transistors and microchips and youve got the right idea. Basically, [Tom] just built an e-bike with motor weak enough that it doesnt need any fancy throttle control. He can just turn the motor hard on or off with a switch.\nThe bike is built around a reed switch motor. This uses magnets on a rotor, which interact with a reed switch to time pulses of electricity to coils which drive the motor. [Tom] wound the coils and built the motor from scratch using 3D printed components. The project quickly ran into problems as the reed switch began to suffer degradation from arcing, which [Tom] solved with some innovative tungsten contacts.\nControlling the bike is pretty simple\u2014theres just a switch connecting a capacitor bank to the motor to provide power on command. No electronics! However, [Tom] has also neatly set up the motor to charge a bank of supercapacitors when coasting downhill. In this regard, the bike can store power on a descent and then use it for a boost when required later on. Between the weird motor and the weedy capacitor bank, it doesnt do much, but it does work.\nIf hes looking for a more potent power source, perhaps the answer is already out on the street  in the form of a battery pack salvaged from the cells in discarded vapes.\n\n", "title": "- \u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cE\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30c8\u30e0\u306f\u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u96fb\u52d5\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u52d5\u304b\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96fb\u5b50\u90e8\u54c1\u306a\u3057\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\uff01\u81ea\u4f5cE\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30ea\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306aE\u30d0\u30a4\u30af", "- \u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30bf\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c6\u30f3\u63a5\u70b9\u3067\u89e3\u6c7a", "- \u8ab0\u3067\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u4e00\u3064\u3067\u52d5\u304f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aE\u30d0\u30a4\u30af", "- \u5ec3\u68c4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u96fb\u6e90\u63a2\u3057"]}

However, the entry-level versions typically cost upwards of $150 and are produced by a single manufacturer. [Colton Baldridge] has created the OS3M Mouse  an open source alternative using PCB coils and 3D printed flexures.\nThe primary challenges in creating a 6DOF input device, similar to the 3Dconnexion Space Mouse, lie in developing a mechanical coupling that enables full range motion, and electronics capable of precisely and consistently measuring this motion. After several iterations of printed flexure combinations and trip down the finite element analysis (FEA) rabbit hole, [Colton] had a working single-piece mechanical solution.\nTo measure the knobs movement accurately, [Colton] employs inductive sensing. Inductance to Digital Converters (LDCs) assess the inductive alterations across three pairs of PCB coils, each having an opposing metal disk mounted on the knob. This setup allows [Colton] to use a Stewart platforms kinematic model calculate the\u00a0 knobs relative position. The calculation are done on an STM32 which also acts USB HID send the position data to a computer. For the demo [Colton] created a simple C++ app to translate the position data to Solidworks API calls.\n\n", "title": "\u300c$150\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3059\u308b6DOF\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u30d7\u30ed\u306eCAD\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u306a6DOF\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u6301\u30643D\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u304c\u4eba\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002PCB\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c$150\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3059\u308b6DOF\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d", "\u300c\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30fb\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u3066\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e6DOF\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u300d", "\u300c3Dconnexion Space Mouse\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\uff01\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eOS3M\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u767a\u8868\u300d", "\u300cPCB\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e6DOF\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u304c\u8a95\u751f\u300d", "\u300c\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3067\u30ce\u30d6\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u8a08\u6e2c\uff01\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e6DOF\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u304c\u8a66\u4f5c\u3055\u308c\u308b\u300d"]}

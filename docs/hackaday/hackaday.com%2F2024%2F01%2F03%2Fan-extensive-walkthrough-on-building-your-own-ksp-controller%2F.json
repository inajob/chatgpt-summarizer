[abzman] took the Pelco KBD300A, a DVR-intended camera controller panel with a joystick, reverse-engineered it, and then rebuilt it into a Kerbal Space Program controller. Whats more, he documented every detail along the way!\nThe write-up is so extensive, its four separate posts  all of them worth reading without a doubt. In the first post, he describes the original hardware, the process of reverse-engineering it, and a few tips for your own RE journeys. Next, he covers about making his own board, showing all the small decisions hes had to make, with plenty of KiCad screenshots. If you are on the lookout for designing such a board, theres plenty to learn!\nThe original hardware didnt go down without a fight  the third post talks about taming the seven-segment displays, the onboard joystick, and fighting with the key matrix wired in exactly the way you wouldnt want. In the end, he shows us how you could tie a controller easily into Kerbal Space Program.\nOne more piece of hardware liberated, one more win for the hacker world. Whether its a Macintosh SE, a classic ThinkPad,\u00a0or even a generic rotary tool, these upgrades are always a joy to see. If you wanted to learn to do such an upgrade yourself, heres us showing how you can pull this off with a classic Sony Vaio!", "title": "\u30da\u30eb\u30b3KBD300A\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u4f5cKerbal Space Program\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u9006\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306b\u518d\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u306e\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u8a18\u9332\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30da\u30eb\u30b3KBD300A\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u81ea\u4f5cKerbal Space Program\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30da\u30eb\u30b3KBD300A\u3092\u89e3\u6790\u3057\u3066\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u7d30\u306a\u624b\u9806", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u6700\u9069\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af", "\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u64cd\u4f5c\u306e\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u76f4\u611f\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

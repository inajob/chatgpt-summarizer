Could you build your own flow battery stationary storage for home-built solar and wind rigs though?\nBased on the concept of appropriate technology, the system from the Flow Battery Research Collective will be easy to construct, easy to maintain, and safe to operate in a residential environment. Current experiments are focusing on Zn/I chemistry, but other aqueous chemistries could be used in the future. Instead of an ion exchange membrane, the battery uses readily attainable photo paper and is already showing similar order of magnitude performance to lab-developed cells.\nAny components that arent off-the-shelf have been designed in FreeCAD. While they can be 3D printed, the researchers have found traditional milling yields better results which isnt too surprising when you need something water-tight. More work is needed, but it is promising work toward a practical, DIY-able energy storage solution.\nIf youre looking to build your own open source wind turbine or solar cells to charge up a home battery system, then weve got you covered. You can also break the chains of the power grid with off-the-shelf parts."}

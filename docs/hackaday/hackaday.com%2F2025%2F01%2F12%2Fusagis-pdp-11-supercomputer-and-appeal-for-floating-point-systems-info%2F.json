Specifically hardware from a company called Floating Point Systems (FPS), whose systems provide computing features to assist e.g. a minicomputer like [David]s PDP-11/44 system with floating point operations. The goal here is to use a stack of 1980s-era FPS hardware to give the PDP-11/44 MIMD (multiple instructions, multiple data) computing features, which is a characteristic associated with supercomputers.\nThe FPS hardware is unfortunately both somewhat rare and not too much documentation, including schematics, has been found so far. This is where [David] would love some help from the community on finding more FPS hardware, documentation and any related information so that it can all be preserved.\nFPS itself was acquired by Cray in 1991, before SGI took over Cray Research in 1996. As is usual with such acquisitions, a lot of older information tends to get lost, along with the hardware as it gets tossed out over the years by companies and others. So far [David] has acquired an FPS-100 array processor, an interface card for the PDP-11 and an FPS-3000, the latter of which appears to be a MIMD unit akin to the FPS-5000.\nWithout schematics, let alone significant documentation, its going to be an uphill battle to make it all work again, but with a bit of help from us retrocomputer enthusiasts, perhaps this might not be as impossible after all.\n\n", "title": "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u5e74\uff1aDavid Lovett\u306e\u6311\u6226", "body": "\u30c7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c9\u304c1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eFPS\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001PDP-11/44\u306bMIMD\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u5171\u6709\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u65b0\u5e74\uff1aDavid Lovett\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u53e4\u304d\u826f\u304dFPS\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u518d\u751f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- PDP-11/44\u3068FPS\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u3088\u308bMIMD\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u80fd\u5f37\u5316", "- \u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u4e0d\u8db3\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u96e3\u984c", "- \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u529b\u3067\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u5b88\u308d\u3046\uff01"]}

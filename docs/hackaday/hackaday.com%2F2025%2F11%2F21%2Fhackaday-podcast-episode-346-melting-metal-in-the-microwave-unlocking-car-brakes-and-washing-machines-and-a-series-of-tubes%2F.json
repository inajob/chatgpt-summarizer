Is it time for the podcast again? Seems like only yesterday that Dan joined Elliot for the weekly rundown of the choicest hacks for the last 1/52 of a year. but here we are. We had quite a bit of news to talk about, including the winners of the Component Abuse Challenge  warning, some components were actually abused for this challenge. Theyre also a trillion pages deep over at the Internet Archive, a milestone that seems worth celebrating.\nAs for projects, both of us kicked things off with Right to repair-adjacent topics, first with a washing machine that gave up its secrets with IR and then with a car that refused to let its owner fix the brakes. We heated things up with a microwave foundry capable of melting cast iron  watch your toes!  and looked at a tiny ESP32 dev board with ludicrously small components. We saw surveyors go to war, watched a Lego sorting machine go through its paces, and learned about radar by spinning up a sonar set from first principles.\nFinally, we wrapped things up with another Al Williams signature Cant Miss Articles section, with his deep dive into the fun hackers can have with the now-deprecated US penny, and his nostalgic look at pneumatic tube systems.\n\nDownload this 100% GMO-free MP3.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 346 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nCongratulations To The 2025 Component Abuse Challenge Winners\nMeet The Shape That Cannot Pass Through Itself\nInternet Archive Hits One Trillion Web Pages\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\n[Andy Geppert] knew that was the annoying sound of the elevator at the Courtyard by Marriot hotel in Pasadena.\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nReverse Engineering The Miele Diagnostic Interface\nHyundai Paywalls Brake Pad Changes\nThe Simplest Ultrasound Sensor Module, Minus The Module\n\nGood Vibrations: Giving The HC-SR04 A Brain Transplant\nBend It Like (Sonar) Beacon With A Phased Array\nFundamentals Of FMCW Radar Help You Understand Your Car\u2019s Point Of View\n\n\nCasting Metal Tools With Kitchen Appliances\n\n\n\nMicrowave Forge Casts The Sinking-est Benchy Ever\nMore Microwave Metal Casting\n\n\n\n\nPossibly-Smallest ESP32 Board Uses Smallest-Footprint Parts\n\nHacking A Pill Camera\n\n\nWWII Secret Agents For Science\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nDamn Fine (Solar Powered) Coffee\nHumane Mousetrap Lets You Know It\u2019s Caught Something\nIn Praise Of Plasma TVs\nExploring The Performance Gains Of Four-Pin MOSFETs\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\nMaking A Machine To Sort One Million Pounds Of LEGO\nThe King Of Rocket Photography\nCheap VHF Antenna?

It survives as a niche format thanks to Fujis Instax line and a group of Dutch entrepreneurs who revived a defunct Polaroid works, but what hasnt made it are the earlier pack and roll film formats for which the picture is revealed by peeling apart a negative and positive side. All isnt lost though, because a small Austrian company has been producing pack film cartridges as a handmade artisan product. To reduce the cost per print theyre now available as a DIY self-assembly kit, and its this which [In an Instant] is taking a look at in their latest video.\nThe kit has enough components for eight shots, and where the original cartridge would have held multiple exposures this one can only hold one at a time. The cartridge itself is cleverly formed from folded card as opposed to the plastic and metal of the original, and the components are a relatively straightforward assembly task. Its a fascinating window into how the Polaroid pack film process worked, with the light-sensitive layer behind a pull-away black light screen, in front of the white positive sheet and with a pouch of developer chemicals to one side. Its in no way cheap at somewhere about 10 dollars a shot, but its amazing that pack film can be recreated and for enthusiasts its a lifeline that keeps their cameras useful.\nThis isnt the first time weve looked at revitalising a pack film camera, but its a lot easier than hacking a Fuji cartridge to do the job.\n\n", "title": "\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u518d\u751f: \u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f01\u696d\u304cDIY\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u8ca9\u58f2", "body": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u306eDIY\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3001Polaroid\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30028\u679a\u5206\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u30011\u679a\u305a\u3064\u306e\u9732\u51fa\u3057\u304b\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u4f5c\u696d\u306f\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u3001\u5149\u611f\u5fdc\u5c64\u3068\u967d\u753b\u306e\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u3001\u73fe\u50cf\u5264\u306e\u888b\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u308b\u30021\u679a10\u30c9\u30eb\u307b\u3069\u3067\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u6551\u3044\u306e\u624b\u3060\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u518d\u751f: \u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u4f01\u696d\u304cDIY\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u8ca9\u58f2", "\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0: \u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u4f1a\u793e\u304c\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3092\u88fd\u9020", "\u5199\u771f\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5fa9\u523b\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308a\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081", "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b: \u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u306e\u8d77\u696d\u5bb6\u304c\u30dd\u30e9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u518d\u751f", "DIY\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u7d44\u7acb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8: \u81ea\u5206\u3067\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b"]}

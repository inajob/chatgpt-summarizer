It survives as a niche format thanks to Fujis Instax line and a group of Dutch entrepreneurs who revived a defunct Polaroid works, but what hasnt made it are the earlier pack and roll film formats for which the picture is revealed by peeling apart a negative and positive side. All isnt lost though, because a small Austrian company has been producing pack film cartridges as a handmade artisan product. To reduce the cost per print theyre now available as a DIY self-assembly kit, and its this which [In an Instant] is taking a look at in their latest video.\nThe kit has enough components for eight shots, and where the original cartridge would have held multiple exposures this one can only hold one at a time. The cartridge itself is cleverly formed from folded card as opposed to the plastic and metal of the original, and the components are a relatively straightforward assembly task. Its a fascinating window into how the Polaroid pack film process worked, with the light-sensitive layer behind a pull-away black light screen, in front of the white positive sheet and with a pouch of developer chemicals to one side. Its in no way cheap at somewhere about 10 dollars a shot, but its amazing that pack film can be recreated and for enthusiasts its a lifeline that keeps their cameras useful.\nThis isnt the first time weve looked at revitalising a pack film camera, but its a lot easier than hacking a Fuji cartridge to do the job.\n\n"}

All joking aside, carefully managing ones time can result in some really wondrous achievements. So its best to learn early, when most of your time is spent generally having fun.\nLets say youve just heard you have five minutes left to play, but what does that mean if youre three years old? Not much, unless you have some visual cues to go by. Thats the idea behind [Julius Curt]s visual timer for toddlers.\nThis lovely reverse progress bar uses a Wemos D1 mini to control a strip of six WS2812B LEDs at 30 LEDs/meter density. Theres a small OLED display for literate users, and the whole thing is childproof. [Julius] challenged himself to do this entire project in one day, and ended up finishing it in a little over eight hours total, including time to design the way cool knob. Be sure to check out the build video below.\nIf you struggle with managing your time, check out our own [Arya Voronova]s personal account.\n\n"}

But computers of that scale are expensive, and not even your tame mad scientist can whistle one out of thin air. Never mind though, because if your life lacks a supercomputer, theres one for sale right now in Wyoming.\nThe Cheyenne Supercomputer was ranked in the top 20 of global computing power back in 2016, when it was installed to work on atmospheric simulation and earth sciences. Theres a page containing exhaustive specs, but overall were talking about a Silicon Graphics ICE XA system with 8,064 processors at 18 cores each for a total of 14,5152 cores, and a not inconsequential 313,344 GB of memory. In terms of software it ran the SuSE Linux Enterprise Server OS, but dont let that stop you from installing your distro of choice.\nIts now being sold on a government auction site in a decommissioned but able to be reactivated state, and given that it takes up a LOT of space were guessing that arranging the trucks to move it will cost more than the computer itself. If youre interested its standing at a shade over $40,000 at the time of writing with its reserve not met, and you have until the 3rd of May to snag it.\nIts clear that the world of supercomputing is a fast-moving one and this computer has been superseded. So whoever buys it wont be joining the big boys any time soon  even though it remains one heck of a machine by mere mortal standards. Were curious then who would buy an old supercomputer, if anyone. Would its power consumption for that much computing make it better off as scrap metal, or is there still a place for it somewhere? Ideas?

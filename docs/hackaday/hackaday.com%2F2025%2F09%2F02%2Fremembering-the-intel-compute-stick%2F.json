The New Unit of Computing (NUC) decidedly became a hit with so-called Mini PCs now everywhere, while the Intel Compute Stick has been largely forgotten. In a recent video by the [Action Retro] one such Compute Stick is poked at, specifically the last model released by Intel in the form of the 2016-era STK1AW32SC, featuring a quad-core Intel Atom x5-Z8330 SoC, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB eMMC storage.\nAs the name suggests, this form factor is very stick-like, with a design that makes it easy to just plug it into the HDMI port of a display, making it a snap to add a computer to any TV or such without taking up a considerable amount of space. Although Intel didnt make more of them after this model, it could be argued that devices like the Chromecast dongle follow the same general concept, and manufacturers like MeLe are still making new PCs in this form factor today.\nIn the video this 2016-era Compute Stick is put through its paces, wiping the Windows 10 installation that was still on it from the last time it was used, and an installation of Haiku was attempted which unfortunately failed to see the eMMC storage. Worse was the current Ubuntu, which saw its installer simply freeze up, but MX Linux saved the day, providing a very usable Linux desktop experience including the watching of YouTube content and network streaming of Steam games.\nAlthough dissed as e-waste by many today, if anything this video shows that these little sticks are still very capable computers in 2025.\n\n", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\uff1a2016\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3068\u306f", "body": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u306eCompute Stick\u306f\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u6210\u529f\u3084\u5931\u6557\u3092\u7d4c\u3066\u30012025\u5e74\u3067\u3082\u6709\u7528\u306aPC\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a55\u4fa1\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1\uff1a2016\u5e74\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3068\u306f", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8PC\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u306eNUC\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "\u4f7f\u3044\u6368\u3066\u304b\uff1f\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30eb\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u898b\u305b\u308b2025\u5e74\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u578bPC\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1aMX Linux\u3067\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4f53\u9a13", "HDMI\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u30d7\u30e9\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5229\u4fbf\u6027\u3068\u73fe\u72b6"]}

This opens the door to controlling the transfer of heat in some of the same ways we are used to controlling electronics.\nHeat management can be a crucial task, especially where electronics are involved. The usual way to manage heat is to draw it out with things like heat sinks. If heat isnt radiating away fast enough, a fan can be turned on (or sped up) to meet targets. Compared to the precision and control with which modern semiconductors shuttle electrons about, the ability to actively manage heat seems lacking.\nThis new device can rapidly adjust thermal conductivity of a channel based on an electrical field input, which is very similar to what a transistor does for electrical conductivity. Applying an electrical field modifies the strength of molecular bonds in a cage-like array of molecules, which in turn adjusts their thermal conductivity.\nIts still early, but this research may open the door to better control of heat within semiconductor systems. This is especially interesting considering that 3D chips have been picking up speed for years (stacking components is already a thing, its called Package-on-Package assembly) and the denser and deeper semiconductors get, the harder it is to passively pull heat out.\nThanks to [Jacob] for the tip!", "title": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb\u30a8\u30fc\uff08UCLA\uff09\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u71b1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u958b\u767a", "body": "UCLA\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u3001\u71b1\u306e\u6d41\u308c\u3092\u96fb\u5834\u3067\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u56fa\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u71b1\u306e\u4f1d\u9054\u3092\u96fb\u5b50\u306e\u5236\u5fa1\u3068\u540c\u69d8\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u30023D\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u666e\u53ca\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30bb\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u5185\u306e\u71b1\u3092\u3088\u308a\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e6\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30fc\u30a8\u30eb\u30a8\u30fc\uff08UCLA\uff09\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u71b1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3092\u958b\u767a", "\u96fb\u5834\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u71b1\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u3092\u5236\u5fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u56fa\u4f53\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u71b1\u4f1d\u5c0e\u7387\u3092\u96fb\u5834\u306e\u5165\u529b\u3067\u65e9\u304f\u8abf\u6574\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b0\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u958b\u767a", "\u30bb\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u5185\u3067\u306e\u71b1\u5236\u5fa1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "\u5bc6\u96c6\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30bb\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u30c0\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u71b1\u7ba1\u7406\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

They will tell you in no uncertain terms when something in their lives needs attention, for example when their water dish is empty. But why not give them a drinking fountain all of their own? Its what [supermarioprof] did for their adorable ginger cat [Piki Piki], providing a cat-operated trickle of water on demand.\nIts a simple enough device in its operation, but very well constructed. Theres a small basin with a train, and a water cistern valve operated by the cat placing a paw on a lever. This starts a trickle of water, from which they can lap as much as they like.\nThe physical construction comes courtesy of some laser-cut ply, and what looks like some 3D print work. Its certainly easy to operate for the cat, and has worked reliably for a few years now.\nThis project is part of the 2025 Pet Hacks contest, so expect to see more in the same vein. If your cats life is improved by one of your projects, consider making an entry yourself!\n \n\n"}

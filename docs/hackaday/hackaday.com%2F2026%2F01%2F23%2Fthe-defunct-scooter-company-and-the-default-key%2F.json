[Rasmus Moorats] has one, and since the app and cloud service the scooter depends on have lost functionality, he decided to reverse engineer it. Along the way he achieved his goal, but found a vulnerability that unlocks all \u00c4ike scooters.\nThe write-up is a tale of app and Bluetooth reverse engineering, ending with the startling revelation of a hardcoded key thats simply ffffffffffffffff. From that he can unlock and interact with any \u00c4ike scooter, except for a subset that were used as hire scooters and didnt have Bluetooth. Perhaps of more legitimate use is the reverse engineering of the scooter functionality.\nWhat do you do when you find a vulnerability in a product whose manufacturer has gone? He reported to the vendor of the IoT module inside the scooter, who responded that the key was a default value that should have been changed by the \u00c4ike developers. Good luck, should you own one of these machines.\nMeanwhile, scooter hacking is very much a thing for other manufacturers too.", "title": "\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u00c4ike\u300d\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3068\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u767a\u898b", "body": "\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u4f1a\u793e\u00c4ike\u306e\u9006\u89e3\u6790\u3067\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u00c4ike\u300d\u306e\u9006\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u3068\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u767a\u898b", "\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u9006\u5de5\u7a0b\u3067\u5fa9\u5143\u3057\u305f\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc", "Bluetooth\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3068\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u9375", "\u88fd\u9020\u5143\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u5f8c\u306e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5831\u544a\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u4ed6\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u5143\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u73fe\u72b6\u3068\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

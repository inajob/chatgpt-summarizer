For example, one prototype was optimized for evaluating and testing camera placement with a high degree of accuracy, and it hardly looks like a VR headset at all.\nThe controllers on the other hand seem to have gone though more iterations based on the ergonomics and physical layout of controls. The VR2 controllers integrate the adaptive triggers from the PlayStation 5, which are of a genuinely clever design capable of variable resistance as well as an active force feedback effect thats not quite like anything thats come before.\nTheres a lot of work that goes into developing something like a VR headset, as we see here and weve seen with Facebooks (now Meta) VR research prototypes. But even when one can leverage pre-made modules as much as possible and doesnt need to start entirely from scratch, making a VR headset remains a whole heap of work.", "title": "\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306ePlayStation VR2\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff01", "body": "\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u304c\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3VR2\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306f\u6a5f\u80fd\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306f\u5927\u304d\u304f\u3066\u6271\u3044\u3065\u3089\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002VR2\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306fPlayStation 5\u306e\u30a2\u30c0\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u7d71\u5408\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u5909\u52d5\u62b5\u6297\u3068\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306b\u306f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u306ePlayStation VR2\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u753b\u50cf\u3068\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u308b\uff01", "PlayStation VR2\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u5927\u304d\u3055\u306b\u9a5a\u304d\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u6700\u9069\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4f55\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u306e\u304b\u8abf\u67fb", "\u9032\u5316\u3057\u305fPlayStation VR2\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u6ce8\u76ee\uff01\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc\u3068\u529b\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u8fbc\u3080", "VR\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u958b\u767a\u306b\u306f\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\uff01Facebook\uff08Meta\uff09\u306e\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3082\u53c2\u8003\u306b", "PlayStation VR2\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3068\u5b8c\u6210\u54c1\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u3002\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3079\u304d\u9032\u5316\u306b\u8feb\u308b"]}

Theres a new game in town, and it is able to use standard concrete blocks to build the walls of a house in just one day.\nAustralian company FBRs Hadrian X is a tablet-controlled system that follows CAD models to lay the blocks one by one. As you can see in the video after the break, the blocks are laid so quickly that theres no time for mortar, so they dip the bottom of each block in construction adhesive instead. In the second video after the break, you can watch Hadrian-X build a curved wall.\nThere are several things to consider when it comes to outdoor robots, such as wind and unwanted vibration. In order to correct for these nuisances, FBR came up with Dynamic Stabilisation Technology (DST). While we dont have a lot of details on DST, the company calls it a highly accurate system that continuously adjusts the position of a robots end effector to ensure it is always held with stability at the correct point in 3D space.\nCurious about printed housing? Heres the current-ish state of affairs.\n\n\n"}

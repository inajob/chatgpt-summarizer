It has to be seen to be believed, and luckily [3D Printing Nerd] gives us lots of beauty shots in this short video, embedded below.\nSmooth, and fast. This bladder took 51 minutes according to the RLP website.\nPrinting a liquid, even a somewhat-viscous one like platinum-cure silicone, presents certain obvious challenges. The Levity solves them with buoyancy: the prints are deposited not onto a bed, but into a gel, meaning they are fully supported as the silicone cures. The fact that the liquid doesnt cure instantly has a side benefit: the layers bleed into one another, which means this technique should (in theory) be much more isotropic in strength than FDM printing. We have no data to back that up, but what you can see for yourself that the layer-blending creates a very smooth appearance in the finished prints.\nIf you watch the video, it really looks like magic, the way prints appear in the gel. The gel is apparently a commercially-available hydrogel, which is good since the build volume looks to need\u00a0 \u0336a\u0336b\u0336o\u0336u\u0336t\u0336 \u03365\u03360\u03360\u0336 \u0336L\u0336 at least 125 L of the stuff. The two-part silicone is also industry-standard and off-the-shelf, though no doubt the exact ratios and are tweaked for purpose. Theres no magic, just a really neat technology.\nIf you want one, you can sign up for the waiting list at Rapid Liquid Prints website, but be prepared to wait; units ship next year, and theres already a list.\nAlternatively, since there is no magic here, wed love to see someone take it on themselves, the way once equally exotic SLS printers have entered the DIY world. There was a time when resin printers were new and exotic and hobbyists had to roll their own, too. None of this is to say we dont respect the dickens out of the Rapid Liquid Print team and their achievementits just that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n"}

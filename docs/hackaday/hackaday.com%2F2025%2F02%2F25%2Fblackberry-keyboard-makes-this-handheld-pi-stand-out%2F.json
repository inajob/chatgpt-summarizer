With such a plethora of devices having been made one might think that the Pi handheld was a done deal, but every so often along comes a new one of such quality to re-ignite the genre. So it is with [Taylor Hay]s BlackberryPi Handheld. As you might guess from the name, it uses a BlackBerry keyboard along with a square LCD screen to create a beautifully executed Pi handheld in an almost GameBoy-like form factor.\nIt starts with a beautifully designed and executed case that holds a Pi and a Pimoroni HyperPixel screen. Unexpectedly this is a full-size Pi, we think a Pi 4. The keyboard is a USB enhanced Blackberry module which also has the famous trackpad, and theres a bezel on the front to protect the screen. The power meanwhile comes from three 18650 cells inside the back of the case, with a power bank PCB. The surprise here is how simple hes made it by careful choice of modules, the usual rats-nest of wires is missing.\nThe files are available so you can make your own, and hes actively encouraging people to remix and improve it. We like this project, a lot, and after youve seen the video below the break, we think you will too. Oddly, this isnt the first time weve seen someone try this combination.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebRaspberry Pi\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u300cBlackberryPi\u300d\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002Pi 4\u3068BC\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u81ea\u7531\u306a\u6539\u826f\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30ebRaspberry Pi\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9", "- \u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306eBlackberryPi\uff1a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u98a8\u306e\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- Pi 4\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ef\u30f3\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "- \u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u914d\u7dda\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u512a\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aBlackberryPi\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u30d8\u30eb\u30c9\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u516c\u958b\u3068\u6539\u9020\u306e\u52e7\u3081"]}

If youre getting a little more busy with geometry, science, or engineering, you might have tacked on a few extra decimal places in your usual calculations. But what about the big dogs? How many decimal places do NASA use?\nNASA doesnt need this many digits. Its likely you dont either. Image credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nThankfully, the US space agency has been kind enough to answer that question. For the highest precision calculations, which are used for interplanetary navigation, NASA uses 3.141592653589793  thats fifteen decimal places.\nThe reason why is quite simple, going into any greater precision is unnecessary. The article demonstrates this by calculating the circumference of a circle with a radius equal to the distance between Earth and our most distant spacecraft, Voyager 1. Using the formula C=2pir with fifteen decimal places of pi, youd only be off on the true circumference of the circle by a centimeter or so. On solar scales, theres no need to go further.\nUltimately, though, you can calculate pi to a much greater precision. Weve seen it done to 10 trillion digits, an effort which flirts with the latest Marvel movies for the title of pure irrelevance.

You can build whatever chunky, awesome thing your heart desires, and thats precisely what [Rahmanshaber] did with the MutantC cyberdeck.\nThe build is based around a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. If youre unfamiliar with the Compute Module, its basically a Raspberry Pi that has been designed specifically for easy integration into a larger carrier PCB. In this case, the carrier PCB interfaces all the other necessary gear to make this a fully functional computer. The PCB is installed inside a vaguely-rectangular 3D-printed enclosure, with a 5-inch TFT LCD on a sliding mount. Push the screen up, and it reveals a small-format keyboard for text entry. Theres also a hall-effect joystick and a couple of buttons for mouse control to boot. [Rahmanshaber] has designed the computer to run off a couple of different battery packs\u2014you can use a pair of 18650 cells if you like, or switch to lager 21700 cells if you want greater capacity for longer running time.\nIf you want a portable Raspberry Pi cyberdeck, you might find this to be a great inspiration. Weve featured many other designs in this vein before, too. Video after the break.\n\n"}

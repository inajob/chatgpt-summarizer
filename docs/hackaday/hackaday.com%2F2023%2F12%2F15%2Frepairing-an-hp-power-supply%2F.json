Especially if, like [Frankie Mashockie], you can do a little repair work. He picked up an HP6038A power supply for $50. We couldnt find the original list price, but even refurbs from professional sources go for around $800. However, the $50 price came with a for parts disclaimer.\nThe power supply is autoranging. You usually think of that as a feature of meters. In a power supply, autoranging means the device can adjust the voltage based on load as you can see explained in the video below.\n\nThe repair had some smoky bits, and it is part 1, so we presume there will be a part 2. The end of this video was pretty hopeful, and we are anxious to see how much more might be wrong with it.\nHP made a lot of power supplies that are still out there. And, of course, there are also the power supplies resident in most of our equipment to repair, too.\n"}

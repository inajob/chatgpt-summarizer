Among decent quality cameras the Leica rangefinder models have near cult-like status, but the problem is for would-be Leica owners that they carry eye-watering prices. [Cristian B\u0103lu\u021b\u0103] approached this problem in s special way, by crafting a Leica-style body for a Panasonic Lumix camera. Given the technology relationship between the Japanese and German companies, we can see the appeal.\nWhile the aesthetics of a Leica are an important consideration, the ergonomics such as the position of the lens on the body dictated the design choices. He was fortunate that the internal design of the Lumix gave plenty of scope for re-arrangement of parts, given that cameras are often extremely packed internally. Some rather bold surgery to the Lumix mainboard and a set of redesigned flex PCBs result in all the parts fitting in the CNC machined case, and the resulting camera certainly looks the part.\nThe write-up is in part a journey through discovering the process of getting parts manufactured, but it contains a lot of impressive work. Does the performance of the final result match up to its looks? Well leave you to be the judge of that. Meanwhile, take a look at another Leica clone.", "title": "\u300c\u30d1\u30ca\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u98a8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "body": "\u30d1\u30ca\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u98a8\u306b\u6539\u9020\u3057\u305f\u8a18\u4e8b\u3002\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u4e21\u7acb\u304c\u8ffd\u6c42\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30d1\u30ca\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u98a8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u6311\u6226\u300d", "\u300c\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff01\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf\u300d", "\u300c\u5de5\u592b\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u2014\u30eb\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u6539\u9020\u8a18\u300d", "\u300c\u9ad8\u4fa1\u683c\u306a\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u3092\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u89e3\u6c7a\u6cd5\u300d", "\u300c\u30eb\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u5927\u80c6\u306a\u6539\u9020\uff01\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u4e21\u7acb\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u300d"]}

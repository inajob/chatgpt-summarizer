Perhaps there should be one of those immutable Laws stating that for each step in learning about these essential parts, the level of the maths you are expected to learn goes up in an exponential curve, for its certainly true that most of us breathe a hefty sigh of relief when that particular course ends. Its not impossible to understand waveguides though, and [Old Hack EE] is here to slice through the formulae with some straightforward explanations.\nFirst of all we learn about the basics of propagation in a waveguide, then we look at the effects of dimension on frequency. Again, theres little in the way of head-hurting maths, just real-world explanations of cutt-off frequencies, and of coupling techniques. For the first time weve seen, here are simple and understandable explanations of the different types of splitter, followed up by the famous Magic T. Its all in the phase, this is exactly the stuff we wish wed had at university.\nThe world needs more of this type of explanation, after all its rare to watch a YouTube video and gain an understanding of something once badly taught. Take a look, the video is below the break.\n\n"}

Each lightning bolt has a staggering amount of power, and, clearly, you can hear the results on any radio. But it is possible to optimize a simple receiver circuit to specifically pick up lightning. Thats exactly what [Wenzeltech] shows in a page with several types of lightning detectors complete with photos and schematics.\nJust as with a regular radio, there are multiple ways to get the desired result. The first circuits use transistors. Later versions move on to op amps and even have storm intensity meters. The final project uses an ion chamber from a smoke detector. It has the benefit of being very simple, but you know, also slightly radioactive.\nYou might think you could detect lightning by simply looking out the window. While thats true, you can, in theory, detect events from far away and also record them easily using any data acquisition system on a PC, scope, or even logic analyzer.\nWhy? We are sure theres a good reason, but weve never needed one before. These designs look practical and fun to build, and thats good enough for us.\nYou can spruce up the output easily. You can also get it all these days, of course, on a chip.", "title": "- \u96f7\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u53d7\u4fe1\u56de\u8def", "body": "\u96f7\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3059\u308b\u56de\u8def\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u3084\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u96f7\u3092\u691c\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u53d7\u4fe1\u56de\u8def", "- \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30b9\u30bf\u304b\u3089\u30aa\u30da\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u307e\u3067\u306e\u96f7\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306e\u9032\u5316", "- \u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30af\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96f7\u691c\u51fa", "- PC\u3084\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30ca\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3067\u96f7\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u697d\u3057\u304f\u3066\u5b9f\u7528\u7684\u306a\u96f7\u691c\u51fa\u56de\u8def\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9"]}

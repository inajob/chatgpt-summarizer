Being fairly new, it offers a lot of advantages where replacing existing wiring is difficult, or where the weight of the additional conductors is a concern, such as with the underwater sensor node project that [Michael Orenstein] and [Scott] dreamed up and implemented as part of a design challenge. With just a single twisted pair, this sensor node got access to a full-duplex 10 Mbit connection as well as up to 50 watts of power.\nThe SPE standards (100BASE-T1, 1000BASE-T1 and NGBASE-T1) 10BASE-T1 can do at least 15 meters (10BASE-T1S), but the 10BASE-T1L variant is rated for at least 1 kilometer. This makes it ideal for a sensor thats placed well below the waters surface, while requiring just the single twisted pair cable when adding Power over Data Lines (PoDL). Whereas Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) uses its own dedicated pairs, PoDL piggybacks on the same wires as the data, requiring it to be coupled and decoupled at each end.\n\nCoupling and decoupling data with a PoDL powered device with 10BASE-T1. (Credit: Michael Orenstein  Scott, Electric UI)\nWithin the PoDL standard there are sixteen supported power classes along with a compatibility matrix for 10XXBASE-1T standards. Detecting of a PD-compatible device is done by the power supply providing a constant current source and the powered device sinking current to adjust the voltage to hit a specific level. With all of this knowledge and the requisite parts in mind and hand, a waterproof enclosure was sourced, firmware written and everything assembled to create a sensor node for temperature, humidity (SHTC3), motion (LSM6DSO) and depth/pressure (MS5837).\nSo thats power and communications settled. All of a sudden, that homebrew ROV youve been dreaming of is starting to look a little more achievable."}

Being fairly new, it offers a lot of advantages where replacing existing wiring is difficult, or where the weight of the additional conductors is a concern, such as with the underwater sensor node project that [Michael Orenstein] and [Scott] dreamed up and implemented as part of a design challenge. With just a single twisted pair, this sensor node got access to a full-duplex 10 Mbit connection as well as up to 50 watts of power.\nThe SPE standards (100BASE-T1, 1000BASE-T1 and NGBASE-T1) 10BASE-T1 can do at least 15 meters (10BASE-T1S), but the 10BASE-T1L variant is rated for at least 1 kilometer. This makes it ideal for a sensor thats placed well below the waters surface, while requiring just the single twisted pair cable when adding Power over Data Lines (PoDL). Whereas Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) uses its own dedicated pairs, PoDL piggybacks on the same wires as the data, requiring it to be coupled and decoupled at each end.\n\nCoupling and decoupling data with a PoDL powered device with 10BASE-T1. (Credit: Michael Orenstein  Scott, Electric UI)\nWithin the PoDL standard there are sixteen supported power classes along with a compatibility matrix for 10XXBASE-1T standards. Detecting of a PD-compatible device is done by the power supply providing a constant current source and the powered device sinking current to adjust the voltage to hit a specific level. With all of this knowledge and the requisite parts in mind and hand, a waterproof enclosure was sourced, firmware written and everything assembled to create a sensor node for temperature, humidity (SHTC3), motion (LSM6DSO) and depth/pressure (MS5837).\nSo thats power and communications settled. All of a sudden, that homebrew ROV youve been dreaming of is starting to look a little more achievable.", "title": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30da\u30a2\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\uff08SPE\uff09\uff1a10BASE-T1\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027 ", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u304410BASE-T1 Ethernet\u6a19\u6e96\u306f\u3001\u5358\u4e00\u306e\u5c0e\u4f53\u5bfe\u3067\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u914d\u7dda\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u63db\u3048\u305f\u308a\u8ffd\u52a0\u306e\u5c0e\u4f53\u306e\u91cd\u3055\u304c\u554f\u984c\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306b\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u5358\u4e00\u306e\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u30da\u30a2\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30eb\u30c7\u30e5\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e10 Mbit\u63a5\u7d9a\u3068\u6700\u592750\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u4f9b\u7d66\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30da\u30a2\u30a4\u30fc\u30b5\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\uff08SPE\uff09\uff1a10BASE-T1\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u53ef\u80fd\u6027 ", "\u6c34\u4e2d\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1a10BASE-T1\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u5fdc\u7528 ", "\u5358\u4e00\u30c4\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\u30da\u30a2\u3067\u6700\u59271\u30ad\u30ed\u9054\u6210\uff1a10BASE-T1L\u306e\u7279\u9577 ", "PoDL\u898f\u683c\u3068\u306f\uff1a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u7dda\u7d4c\u7531\u96fb\u529b\u4f1d\u9001\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f ", "\u6e7f\u5ea6\u3084\u5727\u529b\u3082\u8a08\u6e2c\u53ef\u80fd\uff1aSPE\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210"]}

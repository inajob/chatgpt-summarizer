A single computer can get rid of a room full of boat anchors, and give you better signal discrimination than all but the best kit. Any SDR project needs an RF receiver, and in this project [mircemk] used a single 6J1 vaccum tube to produce an SSB SDR that combines the best of old and new.\u00a0\nSingle-tube radios are a classic hack, and where a lot of hams got started back in the day, but there is a reason more complicated circuits tend to be used. On the other hand, if you can throw a PC worth of signal processing at the output, it looks like you can get a very sensitive and selective single-sideband (SSB) receiver.\u00a0\nThe 6J1 tube is convenient, since it can run on only 6 V (or down to 3.7 as [mircemk] demonstrates). Here it is used as a mixer, with the oscillator signal injected via the screen grid. Aside from that, the simple circuit consists of a receiving coil, a few resistors and a variable capacitor. How well does it work? Quite well, when paired with a PC; you can judge for yourself in the video embedded below.\nWeve featured a lot of [mircemk]s projects over the years, like this handsome OLED VU meter, or this frequency analyzer with a VFD\u00a0 and even a virtual pinball cabinet made from scraps, among many others.\n\n", "title": "\u4e00\u53f0\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3067\u4f5c\u308bSDR\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "SDR\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f6J1\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306eSSB\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u56de\u8def\u3067\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u53d7\u4fe1\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e00\u53f0\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3067\u4f5c\u308bSDR\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u3068\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff016J1\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u306b\u3088\u308bSSB\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f", "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u56de\u8def\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u53d7\u4fe1", "PC\u3068\u306e\u9023\u643a\u3067\u9032\u5316\u3059\u308b\u5358\u4e00\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u7121\u7dda\u901a\u4fe1", "6J1\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRF\u53d7\u4fe1\u6a5f\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3068\u52b9\u679c"]}

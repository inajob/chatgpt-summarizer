But knowing that the technology existed at one point and actually understanding how it worked is another thing entirely. Its a bit like electronic equivalent to the butter churn  youve heard of it, you could probably even identify an image of one  but should somebody hand you one and ask you to operate it, the result probably wont be too appetizing.\nThats where Andy Geppert comes in. Hes turned his own personal interest into magnetic core memory into a quest to introduce this fascinating technology to a whole new generation thanks to some modern enhancements through his Core64 project. By mating the antiquated storage technology with a modern microcontroller and LEDs, its transformed into an interactive visual experience. Against all odds, hes managed to turned a technology that helped put boots on the Moon half a century ago into a gadget that fascinates both young and old.\nIn this talk at the 2022 Hackaday Supercon, Andy first talks the audience through the basics of magnetic core memory as it was originally implemented. From there, he explains the chain of events that lead to the development of the Core64 project, and talks a bit about where he hopes it can go in the future.\n\nThe Core of Core Memory\nSo naturally the big question is: how does magnetic core memory actually work? If youre familiar with the technology from the Apollo program, you probably know it involved weaving wires and was physically robust enough to make it to the Moon and back. But beyond that, it all seems a bit like magic, especially to modern eyes.\nEach tiny core has three wires woven through it.\nYet in just a few minutes, Andy breaks down the basic principles in a remarkably approachable way. Of course, with his hands on experience, this shouldnt come as much of a surprise. Given the number of Core64 units hes personally assembled, theres probably few people alive today on the entire planet that have woven as much core memory as he has.\nAs the name implies, core memory starts with ferrite coreslots of them. Each core can be magnetized either clockwise or counterclockwise, which corresponds to either a zero or a one. Copper wires woven through the ferrites in the X and Y dimensions can flip the orientation of the cores magnetic field when sufficiently energized, which allows writing to a specific bit in the array. A diagonally woven sense wire is used to detect when a cores magnetic orientation has changed to read its value, but as this is a destructive operation, each read needs to be followed by a write if the data is to be preserved.\nScaling this concept up to increase the storage capacity of the array is easy, so long as you can address the number of wires required. In the 60s that could be a tall order, but luckily modern microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico offer plenty of GPIO, and transistors beefy enough to flip the magnetic orientation of each core come in SMD packages not much larger than the cores themselves.\nIn short, while the manual operation of weaving it is still just as much of a hassle as it was in the Apollo days, we now have the technology to shrink the support hardware down to the point where you can put 64 bits of core memory in the palm of your hand. Of course, thats not terribly useful when you can a 128 GB SD card is a fraction of the size. But then, as Andy discovered, core memory is capable of some tricks that make it a bit more interesting than an SD card.\nAdding an Interactive Twist\nAndy found no shortage of information about magnetic core memory, and was even able to track down a few physical examples at different computer history museums. But none of that really compares to the experience of building it yourself, so he started looking for existing projects for inspiration.\nThat lead him to Magnetic Core Memory Reborn, a project from Ben North and Oliver Nash. Their work not only serves as a deep-dive into the process by which magnetic core memory works, but it also details the construction of a prototypical 32-bit memory array which can be accessed with a standard Arduino. While the duo didnt seem interested in marketing the design themselves, they did provide all of the schematics and design files for others to build from.\nSome more searching revealed that Jussi Kilpelainen had done just that, and produced a more compact version of their 32-bit Arduino array. Even better, he made it available on Tindie as a kit, which meant Andy could finally the hands-on experience with core memory hed been searching for.\nDrawing on an early version of the Core64\nBut as they say, anticipation is often more exciting than the final result. Once Andy had built Jussis core memory kit, he wasnt quite sure what to do with it. Since the addition of LEDs makes everything better, he came up with the idea of placing them behind the array as a way to visualize the state of each core, and was even able to find an off-the-shelf LED module that was nearly the same dimensions and pitch as the weave.\nAfter showing off this early version, the feedback he got was so positive he decided to take the plunge and design his own custom PCB that would bring these two very different technologies together in a larger 64-bit array.\nAccording to Andy, it was simply by chance that he realized influencing the cores with a handheld magnet would allow you to draw on the LEDs behind them. That a magnet could flip the state of each core might seem obvious in retrospect, but if it wasnt for the novel addition of the LED array behind them, it wouldnt have had a practical application. What would have been considered a flaw in 1960 was now a feature.\nMaking Memory Fun\nIf you told one of the engineers behind the Apollo Guidance Computer that in 60 years, kids would actually be playing with the core memory they were currently working with, they would have thought you were nuts. But here we are.\nBy adding RGB LEDs to the back and putting a protective clear panel on the front, the Core64 turns an array of memory into a low resolution touch screen. From there the applications pretty much wrote themselves, such as a simple drawing application and versions of classic games like Snake. This interactive capability makes it a powerful educational tool, demonstrating early computing concepts in a way thats relatable to modern audiences.\nAll told, its probably the most useful work anyone has ever managed to wring out of just 64-bits of RAM.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "Core64: \u8fd1\u4ee3\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3068LED\u3068\u306e\u878d\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30a2\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "Andy Geppert's Core64 project introduces modern upgrades to magnetic core memory technology used in the Apollo Guidance Computer.

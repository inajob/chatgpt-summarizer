With modern storage, this is largely a thing of the past. However, longing for some of that nostalgia, [ItsDanik] has been developing the RFIDisk, a 3D printed floppy drive that can kick off applications when their disk is inserted.\nThe desktop enclosure is printed to look like a standalone floppy drive, allowing use with either desktops or laptops. Theres the familiar 3.5 inch slot ready for your floppy disk, and theres also a 1.3 in. OLED display on the front giving you feedback on the status of the RFIDisk  including telling you whats currently inserted. Inside the enclosure is an Arduino Uno and an MFRC522 RFID reader. As the name would suggest, the way the RFIDisk enclosure reads its media is via NFC, not the traditional magnetic reader. Due to being RFID-based, the disks printed for the RFIDisk are solid without moving parts, but enclose a 25 mm NTAG213 NFC tag.\nOn the software side, [ItsDanik] has developed the RFIDisk Manager Python application, which is used to tie specific NFC tag IDs to commands to run when that tag is read. The application includes some nice features, such as being able to adjust the commands for both when the disk is first read and when its removed from the RFIDisk. You can also change what shows up on the OLED screen when the cartridge is inserted.\nUsing NFC to simulate physical media is a clever trick weve seen before, but if youre looking for something with a bit more physical engagement, you could always put your USB devices into 3D printed cartridges.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u300cRFIDisk\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "RFIDisk\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3067\u3001NFC\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3002OLED\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u72b6\u6cc1\u8868\u793a\u3082\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u300cRFIDisk\u300d\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- NFC\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u4f53\u9a13", "- Arduino\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fRFIDisk\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- RFIDisk Manager\u3067\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u7269\u7406\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306e\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c"]}

This has now led the project to suspend its bug bounty program starting February 1, 2026.\nExamples of such slop are provided by [Daniel] in a GitHub gist, which covers a wide range of very intimidating-looking vulnerabilities and seemingly clear exploits. Except that none of them are vulnerabilities when actually examined by a knowledgeable developer. Each is a lengthy word salad that an LLM churned out in seconds, yet which takes a human significantly longer to parse before dealing with the typical diatribe from the submitter.\nAlthough there are undoubtedly still valid reports coming in, the truth of the matter is that the ease with which bogus reports can be generated by anyone who has access to an LLM chatbot and some spare time has completely flooded the bug bounty system and is overwhelming the very human developers who have to dig through the proverbial midden to find that one diamond ring.\nWe have mentioned before how troubled bounty programs are for open source, and how projects like Mesa have already had to fight off AI slop incidents from people with zero understanding of software development.", "title": "LLM\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u544a\u306e\u8cea\u306e\u4f4e\u4e0b", "body": "cURL\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306f\u3001AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u544a\u306e\u5897\u52a0\u3067\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u5968\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u505c\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["LLM\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\u3059\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u544a\u306e\u8cea\u306e\u4f4e\u4e0b", "cURL\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u5968\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u505c\u6b62", "AI\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e0d\u6b63\u78ba\u306a\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5831\u544a\u306e\u5897\u52a0\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff", "\u958b\u767a\u8005\u3092\u60a9\u307e\u305b\u308b\u300cAI\u30b9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\uff1a\u30d0\u30b0\u5831\u544a\u306e\u6df7\u4e71\u3068\u5bfe\u7b56"]}

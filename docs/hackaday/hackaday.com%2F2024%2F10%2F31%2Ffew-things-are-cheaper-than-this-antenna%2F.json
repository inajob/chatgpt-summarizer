A dual-band mobile radio can easily run $600, and a high-end HF base station with the capability of more than 100 watts will easily be in the thousands of dollars. But, like most things, theres an aspect to the hobby that can be incredibly inexpensive and accessible to newcomers. Crystal radios, for example, can be built largely from stuff most of us would have in our parts drawers, CW QRP radios dont need much more than that, and sometimes even the highest-performing antennas are little more than two lengths of wire.\nFor this specific antenna, [W3CT] is putting together an inverted-V which is a type of dipole antenna. Rather than each of the dipoles legs being straight, the center is suspended at some point relatively high above ground with the two ends closer to the earth. Dipoles, including inverted-Vs, are resonant antennas, meaning that they dont need any tuning between them and the radio so the only thing needed to match the antenna to the feed line is a coax-to-banana adapter. From there its as simple as attaching the two measured lengths of wire for the target band and hoisting the center of the antenna up somehow. In [W3CT]s case hes using a mast which would break the $8 budget, but a tree or building will do just as well.\nThe video on the construction of this antenna goes into great detail, so if you havent built a dipole yet or youre just getting started on your ham radio journey, its a great place to get started. From there wed recommend checking out an off-center-fed dipole which lets a dipole operate efficiently on multiple bands instead of just one, and for more general ham radio advice without breaking the bank wed always recommend the $50 Ham series.\n\n", "title": "- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u306f\u9ad8\u4fa1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306a\u3069\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u81ea\u4f5c\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u9006V\u578b\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u6cd5\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\uff01\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u305f\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "- \u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9V\u578b\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5165\u9580\uff1a\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u6750\u6599\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30c0\u30a4\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca", "- \u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9V\u578b\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u3092\u81ea\u4f5c\u3057\u3088\u3046", "- \u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3059\uff01$50\u30cf\u30e0\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u306e\u57fa\u672c"]}

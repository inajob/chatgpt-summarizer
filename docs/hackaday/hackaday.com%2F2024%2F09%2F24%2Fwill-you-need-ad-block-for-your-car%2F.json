Ford now has a patent that would bring the ads we hate to your vehicles infotainment system. [via PCMag]\nFord has already replied to criticism with the usual corporate spiel of patents not necessarily being the direction the company will go with future products, but its hard to imagine that other automakers arent planning similar systems since theyre already charging extra for heated seats, EV range, and performance. Bringing ads to the captive audience of your personal vehicle and targeting them based on listening to the occupants conversations would be a new low. Maybe youll be able to pay an extra $100/month for the ad-free experience.\nInstead of taking advantage of the EV transition to make better, simpler cars, automakers are using their highly-computerized nature to extract more from you and provide less when you drive off the lot. Enshittification has come for the automobile. Perhaps auto executives should read A Few Reasonable Rules for the Responsible Use of New Technology?\nThe first step of blocking these ads will likely be jailbraking the infotainment system. If that wasnt enough, locking features behind a paywall has come for wheelchairs too."}

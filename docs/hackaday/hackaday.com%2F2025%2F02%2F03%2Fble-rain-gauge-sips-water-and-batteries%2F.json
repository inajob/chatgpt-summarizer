But [Matthew Ford] offers a third option: a simple device with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that can get a few years of a pair of AA batteries.\nThe approach has several advantages. Batteries make the device self-contained, and changing them infrequently is an obvious win. In addition, the BLE allows the device to be wireless and send data directly to an Android device. Thanks to a WH-SP-RG rain gauge, theres not much to that part. The smart part is an nRF52832 module and some minor parts. The phone side uses an off-the-shelf Android app.\nIn a project like this, it is critical to have timers that really put the CPU to sleep. [Matthew] had to modify the Arduino libraries to allow the lp_timer objects to make it to an hour. Without the modifications, the timer can only reach 8.5 minutes. Sure, you could stack them, but that means taking a power hit multiple times an hour which would affect battery life.\nNot the most complex project, but more complexity would mean lower battery life, so  as they say  less is more. We couldnt help but think that with rechargeable batteries and a small solar panel, this could last a very long time.\nLoRa, of course, is another choice. You can make 3D print a tipping bucket device, too."}

What if you could remotely power a wearable device instead?\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University were able to develop a power transmitter that lets power flow over human skin to remote devices over distances as far a head-to-toe. The human body can efficiently transmit 40 MHz RF energy along the skin and keeps this energy confined around the body and through clothing, as the effect is capacitive.\nThe researchers were able to develop several proof-of-concept devices including a Bluetooth\nring with a joystick, a stick-and-forget medical patch which logs data, and a sun-exposure patch with a screen \u2014 demonstrating user input, displays, sensing, and wireless communication. As the researchers state in the paper, this could open up some really interesting new wearable applications that werent possible previously because of power constraints.\nIf youre ready to dive into the world of wearables, how about this hackable smart ring or a wearable that rides rails?\n\n", "title": "- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u76ae\u819a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66", "body": "\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30ae\u30fc\u30e1\u30ed\u30f3\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u304c\u3001\u76ae\u819a\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u9060\u9694\u3067\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u306b\u96fb\u529b\u3092\u9001\u308b\u6280\u8853\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u4e0d\u8981\uff01\u76ae\u819a\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3078\u306e\u96fb\u529b\u4f9b\u7d66", "- \u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u4f53\u3092\u4ecb\u3057\u305f\u96fb\u529b\u4f1d\u9001\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30ae\u30fc\u30e1\u30ed\u30f3\u5927\u5b66\u304c\u958b\u767a\u3057\u305f\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u7528\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9mitter", "- \u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u5165\u529b\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30ed\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30c7\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9", "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u4f53\u9a13\u3092!"]}

They offer many advantages for ensuring the effective mixing of solutions compared to other methods of stirring, including consistency, precise control, operation within closed systems, and of course, hands-free automatic operation. With so many reasons for employing a magnetic stirrer, its not too surprising that [Joey] would want one. He built his using 3D-printed parts rather than purchasing it.\nThe magnetic stirrer uses a 3D-printed enclosure for the base. Inside is a PWM controller which sends power to a small DC motor. A 3D-printed arm is attached to the motor, which hosts a pair of magnets. As the arm spins inside the enclosure, the magnetic fields from the magnet couple with the stir bar inside the mixture, allowing it to spin without any mechanical link to the stirring device and without any input from the user. [Joey] has also made all the 3D-printed parts for this build available on Printables.\nWhile magnetic stirrers arent the most complicated of devices (or the most expensive), building tools like this anyway often has other advantages, such as using parts already on hand, the ability to add in features and customizations that commercial offerings dont have, or acting as a teaching aid during construction and use. Its also a great way to put the 3D printer to work, along with this other piece of 3D-printed lab equipment designed for agitating cell cultures instead.", "title": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6301\u3064\u4eba\u304c\u3001\u78c1\u6c17\u652a\u62cc\u5b50\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u6df7\u3056\u308b\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306b\u6eb6\u6db2\u3092\u6df7\u305c\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30cf\u30f3\u30ba\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u81ea\u52d5\u7684\u306b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u78c1\u6c17\u64b9\u62cc\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u3068\u6d3b\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

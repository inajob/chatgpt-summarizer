Counterfeit hardware is everywhere, especially when youre purchasing things sight unseen over the Internet. [Jon Bruner] recently set out to look at a bunch of fake AirPod clones, and found that the similarities between the imposters and the real thing are only skin deep. A CT scan reveals all.\nAs you might expect, Apples AirPods are a fine example of miniaturization. Theyre packed to the gills with hardware, with very little wasted space inside. Flexible PCBs hook up the electronics in an elegant and tidy fashion. Three tiny MEMS microphones are on board to capture the users voice and filter out noise. The battery that runs the show is a hefty lithium-ion coin cell which fills almost all the empty space behind the audio driver.\nBy contrast, the fakes look positively weedy inside. They cut out the bonus microphones, using just one to do the job. Wires link up the different components, with unimpressive blobby soldering visible that has splattered around the internal enclosure. Even the cases are lower-tech, with a weaker battery and a poorer charging solution. Hilariously, cheaping out on the tech makes the fakes lighter, so they compensate by adding weights to create a sense of heft for the user.\nIts amazing how much is revealed by a CT scan, that doesnt even require opening the devices to tear them down. Fake hardware really is a scourge that many in the tech industry find themselves fighting against on a regular basis.", "title": "CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u507d\u9020\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "body": "\u507d\u7269\u306eAirPod\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u672c\u7269\u3068\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u4e2d\u8eab\u306f\u52a3\u308a\u3001CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u3067\u305d\u306e\u5dee\u304c\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u507d\u7269\u306f\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u3084\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u3069\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3057\u3001\u914d\u7dda\u3082\u7c97\u96d1\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u305f\u3081\u91cd\u3055\u306b\u507d\u88c5\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u91cd\u308a\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3002CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306f\u507d\u7269\u306e\u767a\u898b\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3064\u3002", "titles": ["CT\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u507d\u9020\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u5b9f\u614b", "\u507d\u306eAirPod\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u5185\u90e8\u69cb\u9020\u304c\u5927\u304d\u304f\u7570\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5224\u660e", "\u507d\u9020\u54c1\u306e\u8efd\u91cf\u5316\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u91cd\u3055\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u507d\u7269\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u4e0d\u8db3\u306b\u3088\u308b\u97f3\u58f0\u53ce\u9332\u80fd\u529b\u306e\u4f4e\u4e0b", "\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u696d\u754c\u304c\u65e5\u3005\u507d\u9020\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u306e\u6226\u3044\u306b\u6311\u3080"]}

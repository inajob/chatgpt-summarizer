[Tony Goacher] was approached by a local college, though, which had a problem with this technology. Namely, that students were using them and leaving them filthy. They posed a simple question\u2014could these bikes become something else?\n[Tonys] solution was simple\u2014the bikes would be turned into game controllers. This was easily achieved by fitting a bi-color disc into the blender assembly. As the wheel on the bike turns, it spins up the blender, with the disc inside. An ESP32 microcontroller paired with a light sensor is then able to count pulses as the disc spins, getting a readout of the blenders current RPM. Working backwards, this can then be calculated out into the bikes simulated road speed and used to play a basic game on an attached Raspberry Pi. Notably, the rig is setup such that the Raspberry Pi and one bike connect to an access point hosted by the other bike.\u00a0 This is helpful, because it means neither bike has too many dangling cables that could get caught up in a wheel or chain.\nWeve seen many amusing game peripherals over the years, from salad spinners to turntables.\u00a0Video after the break.\n\n\n\n"}

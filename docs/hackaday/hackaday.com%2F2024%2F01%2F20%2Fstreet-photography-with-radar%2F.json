Photographers who specialized in up-close-and-personal street photography in the mid-20th century faced the problem of how to focus their cameras. The first single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) were rare and expensive beasts, so for most this meant a mechanical rangefinder either clipped to the accessory shoe, or if you were lucky, built into the camera.\nThe modern equivalent uses an inexpensive 24 GHz radar module coupled to an ESP32 board with an OLED display, and fits in a rather neat 3D printed enclosure that sits again in the accessory shoe. It has a 3 meter range perfect for the street photographer, and the distance can easily be read out\u00a0 and dialed in on the lens barrel.\nWhenever the revival of film photography is discussed, its inevitable that someone will ask why, and point to the futility of using silver halides in a digital age. Its projects like this one which answer that question, with second-hand SLRs being cheap and plentiful you might ask why use a manual rangefinder over one of them, but the answer lies in the fun of using one to get the perfect shot. Try it, youll enjoy it!\nSome of us have been known to dabble in film photography, too.\nThanks [Joyce] for the tip.", "title": "\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u306b\u767b\u5834\uff01", "body": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u5199\u771f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306b\u4f34\u3044\u3001\u6614\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u518d\u751f\u7523\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u7248\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3068ESP32\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u8ddd\u96e2\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u8aad\u307f\u53d6\u308a\u3001\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u30d0\u30ec\u30eb\u306b\u5165\u529b\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u918d\u9190\u5473\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u73fe\u4ee3\u7248\u306e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u306b\u767b\u5834\uff01", "\u6614\u306a\u304c\u3089\u306e\u6a5f\u6750\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u8a95\u751f", "\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u3082\u6620\u753b\u5199\u771f\u306e\u5fa9\u6d3b\uff01\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u5fc5\u898b\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc", "ESP32\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u642d\u8f09\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u304c\u4fbf\u5229\uff01", "\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u5207\u308a\u53d6\u308d\u3046\uff01\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u306f"]}

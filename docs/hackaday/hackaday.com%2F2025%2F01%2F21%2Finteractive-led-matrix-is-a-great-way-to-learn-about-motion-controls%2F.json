What can be more fun is when the LEDs are actually interactive in some regard. [Giulio Pons] achieved this with his interactive LED box, which lets you play with the pixels via motion controls.\nThe build runs of a Wemos D1 mini, which is a devboard based around the ESP8266 microcontroller. [Giulio] hooked this up to a matrix of WS2812B addressable LEDs in two 328 panels, creating a total display of 512 RGB LEDs. The LEDs are driven with the aid of an Adafruit graphics library that lets the whole display be addressed via XY coordinates. For interactivity, [Giulio] added a MPU6050 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer to the build. Meanwhile, power is via 18650 lithium-ion cells, with the classic old 7805 regulator stepping down their output to a safe voltage.\u00a0Thanks to the motion sensing abilities of the MPU6050, [Giulio] was able to code animations where the LEDs emulate glowing balls rolling around on a plane.\nIts a simple build, but one that taught [Giulio] all kinds of useful skills\u2014from working with microcontrollers to doing the maths for motion controls. Theres a lot you can do with LED matrixes if you put your mind to it, and if you just start experimenting, youre almost certain to learn\u00a0something. Video after the break.\n\n\n", "title": "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6LED\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306aLED\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u52d5\u304d\u3067LED\u3092\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u6280\u8853\u3084\u6570\u5b66\u3092\u5b66\u3073\u9762\u767d\u3044\u5236\u4f5c\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6LED\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "- Wemos D1 mini\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "- MPU6050\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u53cd\u5fdc\u3059\u308bLED\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "- LED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3067\u5b66\u3076\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- 512RGB LED\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u9b45\u529b\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u5236\u5fa1"]}

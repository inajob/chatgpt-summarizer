This makes LTO cells capable of much faster charging and with better stability characteristics, albeit at the cost of lower energy density. Much like LiFePO4 cells, this makes them interesting for a range of applications where the highest possible energy density isnt the biggest concern, while providing even more stability and long-term safety.\nThat said, LTO is uncommon enough that finding a battery management system (BMS) can be a bit of a pain. This is where [Vlastimil Slintak]s open source LTO BMS project may come in handy, which targets single cell (1S) configurations with the typical LTO cell voltage of around 1.7  2.8V, with 3 cells in parallel (1S3P). This particular BMS was designed for low-power applications like Meshtastic nodes, as explained on the accompanying blog post which also covers the entire development and final design in detail.\nThe BMS design features all the stuff that youd hope is on there, like under-voltage, over-voltage and over-current protection, with an ATtiny824 MCU providing the brains. Up to 1 A of discharge and charge current is supported, for about 2.4 Watt at average cell voltage. With the triple 1,300 mAh LTO cells in the demonstrated pack youd have over 9 Wh of capacity, with the connected hardware able to query the BMS over I2C for a range of statistics.\nThanks to [Marcel] for the tip.", "title": "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u9178 (LTO) \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u7279\u9577\u3068\u5229\u70b9", "body": "\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u9178(LTO)\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u5145\u96fb\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u5bc6\u5ea6\u306f\u4f4e\u3081\u3002\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eBMS\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4f4e\u96fb\u529b\u7528\u9014\u5411\u3051\u306b\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ea\u30c1\u30a6\u30e0\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u9178 (LTO) \u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u7279\u9577\u3068\u5229\u70b9", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306eLTO\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30cd\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08BMS\uff09\u3068\u306f", "LTO\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6025\u901f\u5145\u96fb\u3068\u5b89\u5b9a\u6027", "\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u901a\u4fe1\u7528\u4f4e\u96fb\u529b\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5411\u3051BMS\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "LTO\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u5bb9\u91cf\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u8a73\u7d30\u89e3\u6790"]}

Its not completely impossible for the night sky to deliver impressive imagery on a budget though, as [David Schneider] shows us with a Raspberry Pi powered whole sky camera.\nThe project was born of seeing a meteor and idly wondering whether meteorite landing sites could be triangulated from a network of cameras, something he quickly discovered had already been done with some success. Along the way though he found the allsky camera project, and decided to build his own. This took the form of a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Pi HQ camera with a wide-angle lens mounted pointing skywards under an acrylic dome. Its not the Hubble Space Telescope by any means, but the results are nevertheless impressive particularly in a timelapse. We wish there were less light pollution where we live so we could try it for ourselves.\nLong-term readers may remember that this isnt the first Pi sky camera weve brought you, for example this one is from 2020.\n\n", "title": "Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5168\u5929\u5019\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308d\u3046\uff01", "body": "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5168\u5929\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5929\u4f53\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u3082\u4f5c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c7a\u3081\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u3067\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u5199\u771f\u304c\u64ae\u308c\u308b\u3068\u8a55\u5224\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u5168\u5929\u5019\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3067\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u5929\u4f53\u5199\u771f\u3092\u64ae\u308d\u3046\uff01", "\u4e88\u7b97\u5185\u3067\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u3092\u6349\u3048\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aRaspberry Pi\u306e\u5168\u5929\u5019\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "\u5922\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u5b9f\u73fe\uff01Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u5168\u5929\u5019\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306a\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u6301\u305f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u3001Raspberry Pi\u3067\u4e00\u76ee\u77ad\u7136\uff01\u5168\u5929\u5019\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "\u30e9\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30a4\u3068\u5e83\u89d2\u30ec\u30f3\u30ba\u3067\u3001\u5149\u5bb3\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u661f\u7a7a\u3092\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d7\u30b9\u64ae\u5f71\uff01"]}

Hoverboards then terrified the world with nasty accidents and surprise fires. [James Bruton] loves hoverboards regardless, and set out on a mighty upgrade regime turning the ride-on toy into a giant omniwheeled bicycle.\nThe build relies on two giant omniwheels of [Jamess] own creation, using lasercut and 3D-printed parts. The wheels are mounted perpendicularly on either end of a boxy plywood bike frame built in two sections, with a split in the middle. The two halves can rotate relative to each other, much like the two halves of a stock hoverboard.\nAmazingly, the build relies on the stock hoverboard motors and electronics. The hoverboard wheel motors are responsible for driving the omniwheels at either end via a toothed belt drive. The gear ratio of the belt reduction is set up to cancel out the greater diameter of the omniwheels, such that the hoverboards tuning isnt disrupted. Wisely, [James] also fitted a safety power cutout, too.\nThe result is a self-balancing bike the likes of which youve never seen before. At present, it can balance upright and rotate relatively well. However, control is difficult, requiring the use of the riders body weight and the twisting of the bikes sections. [James] has instead contemplated using servos to tilt the hoverboard sensors instead for an easier control method than the current setup.\nIts a truly bonkers build which is a testament to [Jamess] creativity and prowess. Weve seen some other great hoverboard hacks before, but nothing quite like this. Video after the break.\n\n\n"}

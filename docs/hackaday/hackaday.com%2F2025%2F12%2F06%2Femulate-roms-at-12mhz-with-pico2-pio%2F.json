Even worse, what if youre rolling your own firmware? Period-appropriate EPROMs and their programmers arent always cheap or easy to get a hold of these days. [Kyo-ta04] had that problem, and thanks to them, we now all have a solution: Pico2ROMEmu, a ROM emulator based on, you guessed it, the Raspberry Pi Pico2.\n\nThe Pico2ROMEmu in its natural habitat on a Z80 SBC.\nThe ROM emulator has been tested at 10MHz with a Z80 processor and 12MHz with an MC68000. An interesting detail here is that rather than use the RP2350s RISC-V or ARM cores, [kyo-ta04] is doing all the work using the chips powerful PIO. PIO means programmable I/O, and if you need a primer, check this out. Using PIO means the main core of the microcontroller neednt be involved  and in this context, a faster ROM emulator.\nWeve seen ROM emulators before, of course  the OneROM comes to mind, which can also use the RP2350 and its PIOs. That project hasnt been chasing these sorts of speeds as it is focused on older, slower machines. That may change in the newest revision. Its great to see another contender in this space, though, especially one to serve slightly higher-performance retrocomputers.\u00a0 Code and Gerbers for the Pico2RomeEMU are available on GitHub under an MIT license.\nThanks to [kyo-ta04] for the tip.\n\n", "title": "- Raspberry Pi Pico2\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044ROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cPico2ROMEmu\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "Pico2ROMEmu\u306fRaspberry Pi Pico2\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3001\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5411\u3051\u306b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3002", "titles": ["- Raspberry Pi Pico2\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044ROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300cPico2ROMEmu\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u5411\u3051ROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6280\u8853", "- PIO\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306aROM\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f", "- Z80\u304a\u3088\u3073MC68000\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5\u3067\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u7d50\u679c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u6210\u679c", "- GitHub\u3067\u5165\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u300cPico2ROMEmu\u300d\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3068Gerbers\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"]}

(Credit: Luke Bell, YouTube)\nFresh off a world record for the fastest quadcopter, [Luke Bell] decided to try his luck with something more own to earth, namely trying to tackle the world record for the fastest RC car, with the current record set at 360 km/h. Starting off with a first attempt in what will be a video series, the obvious approach seems to be to get some really powerful electric motors, a streamlined body and a disused runway to send said RC car hurtling along towards that golden medal. Of course, if it was that easy, others would have done it already.\nWith the quadcopter record of nearly 500 km/h which we covered previously, the challenge was in a way easier, as other than air resistance and accidental lithobraking there are no worries about ground texture, tire wear or boundary layer aerodynamics. In comparison, the RC car has to contend with all of these, with the runways rough tarmac surface being just one of the issues, along with making sure that the wheels would hold up to the required rotation speed. For the wheels you got options like foam, hard rubber, etc., all with their own advantages and disadvantages, mostly in terms of grip and reliability.\nSo far speeds of over 200 km/h are easy enough to do, with foam wheels being the preferred option. To push the RC car to 300 km/h and beyond, a lot more experimentation and trial runs will have to be performed. Pending are changes to the aerodynamic design with features also commonly seen in F1 race cars such as downforce spoilers, diffusers and other tricks which should prevent the RC car from (briefly) becoming an RC airplane.\n\n", "title": "- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u901fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u304c\u6700\u901fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306b\u6311\u6226\u4e2d\u3002360km/h\u306e\u8a18\u9332\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3001\u8ab2\u984c\u306f\u7a7a\u529b\u3068\u30bf\u30a4\u30e4\u306e\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e16\u754c\u6700\u901fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u6311\u6226\uff1a\u30eb\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u65b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u96fb\u52d5\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30df\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9769\u65b0", "- \u901f\u5ea6300km/h\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059RC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u6311\u6226", "- \u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5229\u70b9\u30fb\u6b20\u70b9", "- F1\u6280\u8853\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u305fRC\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u6226\u7565"]}

Sharing was the case in [Matthias] house during the pandemic, as he and his wife took turns using the desk. Switching between their two preferred heights quickly became annoying, so [Matthias] engineered LYFT, a replacement controller that stores up to four settings.\nIn addition, the new SAMD21-based controller allows them to raise and lower the desk without having to hold the button down. And finally, having a digital readout showing the position is just plain cool. As youll see in the manual (PDF), LYFT is as easy to set up and use as the average flat-packed product.\nIn order to make this work, [Matthias] had to figure out how the desks motors communicate out of the box, and he did so with the help of a BEKANT controller project by [Greg Cormier]. You wont find LYFT at the blue and yellow, at least not yet; for now, youll have to shop Tindie or build it yourself.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fcLYFT: IKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "body": "IKEA\u306eBEKANT sit/stand\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306f\u9ad8\u3055\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3067\u304d\u3001\u8907\u6570\u4eba\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b\u969b\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\u30d1\u30f3\u30c7\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u4e2d\u306f\u59bb\u3068\u4ea4\u4ee3\u3067\u4f7f\u3044\u30012\u4eba\u306e\u597d\u307f\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u3092\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308bLYFT\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3002SAMD21\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306f\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u62bc\u3057\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fcLYFT: IKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba", "\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u30e9\u30fc\u5411\u3051\uff1a4\u3064\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3092\u8a18\u61b6\u53ef\u80fd\u306aIKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "SAMD21\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067IKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u3092\u81ea\u52d5\u8abf\u6574", "IKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u7528\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fcLYFT\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3068\u4f7f\u7528\u6cd5", "IKEA BEKANT\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff1a\u30c7\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u660e"]}

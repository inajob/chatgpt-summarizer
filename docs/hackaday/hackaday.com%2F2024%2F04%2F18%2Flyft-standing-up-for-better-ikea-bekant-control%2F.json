Sharing was the case in [Matthias] house during the pandemic, as he and his wife took turns using the desk. Switching between their two preferred heights quickly became annoying, so [Matthias] engineered LYFT, a replacement controller that stores up to four settings.\nIn addition, the new SAMD21-based controller allows them to raise and lower the desk without having to hold the button down. And finally, having a digital readout showing the position is just plain cool. As youll see in the manual (PDF), LYFT is as easy to set up and use as the average flat-packed product.\nIn order to make this work, [Matthias] had to figure out how the desks motors communicate out of the box, and he did so with the help of a BEKANT controller project by [Greg Cormier]. You wont find LYFT at the blue and yellow, at least not yet; for now, youll have to shop Tindie or build it yourself."}

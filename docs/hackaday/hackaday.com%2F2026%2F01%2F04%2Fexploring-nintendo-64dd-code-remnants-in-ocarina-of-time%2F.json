This was the premise of the Nintendo 64DD peripheral, and the topic of a recent video by [Skawo] in which an archaeological code dig is performed to see what traces of the abandoned product may remain.\nThe 64DD slots into the bottom of the console where the peripheral connector is located, following which the console can read and write the magnetic discs of the 64DD. At 64 MB it matched the cartridge in storage capacity, while also being writable unlike cartridges or CDs. It followed on previous formats like the Famicom Disk System.\nFor 1998s Game of the Year title The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time such a 64DD-based expansion was worked on for a while before being cancelled along with the 64DD. With this Zelda game now decompiled, its source code has shown to be still full of 64DD-related code that [Skawo] takes us through in the video.\n\nThe Nintendo 64DD discs resembled ZIP discs. (Credit: Evan-Amos, Wikimedia)\nAs is typical for CD- and magnetic storage formats like these 64DD discs, their access times and transfer speeds are atrociously slow next to a cartridges mask ROM, which clearly left the developers scrambling to find some way to use the 64DD as an actual enhancement. Considering that the 64DD never was released outside of Japan and had a very short life, it would seem apparent that, barring PlayStation-level compromises, disc formats just werent a good match for the console.\nThe interface with the 64DD in the games code gives some idea of what the developers had in mind, which mostly consisted out of swapping on-cartridge resources like dungeon maps with different ones. Ultimately this content did make its way into a commercial release, in the form of the\u00a0Master Quest option on the games re-release on the GameCube.\nAlthough this doesnt enable features once envisioned, such as tracking the players entire route and storing permanent map changes during gameplay, it at least gives us a glimpse of what the expansion game on the 64DD could have looked like.\n\n\nTop image: N64 with stacked 64DD, credit: Evan-Amos", "title": "\u4efb\u5929\u580264DD\uff1a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u878d\u5408", "body": "\u4efb\u5929\u580264DD\u306f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3068\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u4f75\u7528\u306e\u5468\u8fba\u6a5f\u5668\u3002\u300e\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u300f\u306e\u62e1\u5f35\u4f01\u753b\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u304c\u4e2d\u6b62\u3002", "titles": ["\u4efb\u5929\u580264DD\uff1a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u3068\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u878d\u5408", "\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\uff1a64DD\u306e\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u62e1\u5f35\u306e\u8b0e", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff1a64DD\u306e\u907a\u7523\u3092\u63a2\u308b", "\u4efb\u5929\u580264\u306e\u9650\u754c\uff1a\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u6280\u8853\u7684\u8ab2\u984c", "\u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u5947\u8de1\uff1a64DD\u3068\u305d\u306e\u672a\u5b9f\u73fe\u6a5f\u80fd"]}

[Marian] has provided us a great example in the form of his own digital business card, which doubles as a handheld game!\nWanting to make his business card more interesting for better engagement, [Marian] was inspired by the Arduboy to give it some interactivity. He chose the STM32G030F6 microcontroller as a cheap and reliable option to run his business card. He then created a 109 LED matrix display using Charlieplexing to minimize the amount of I/O pins required. For controls, he went with the usual directional cross plus two action buttons. He implemented a variety of games on the card\u2014including a Flappy Bird clone and a game similar to the classic Simon toy.\nFiles are on GitHub for the curious. Weve featured some other great business cards this year, too. Indeed, we ran a whole challenge! If youre cooking up your own exemplary little PCB to hand out at conferences, dont hesitate to let us know!\n \n\n", "title": "\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u540d\u523a\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u300d", "body": "\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u5358\u306a\u308b\u9023\u7d61\u5148\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7d19\u5207\u308c\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001[Marian]\u306f\u81ea\u8eab\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002Arduboy\u306b\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3001STM32G030F6\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3002GitHub\u306b\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u540d\u523a\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u300d", "\u300cSTM32G030F6\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLED\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u540d\u523a\u300d", "\u300cArduboy\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u540d\u523a\u300d", "\u300cGitHub\u3067\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4ed8\u304d\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u540d\u523a\u300d", "\u300c\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u5411\u3051\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306aPCB\u540d\u523a\u3092\u624b\u4f5c\u308a\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff01\u300d"]}

He picked it up on eBay, and he knew it wasnt working, but it was in good condition, especially for the price. Hes posted four videos about whats inside and how hes fixing it. You can see the first installment below.\nThe 4200B is an RMS voltmeter and is selective because it has a tuned circuit to adjust to a particular frequency. The unit uses discrete components and has an analog meter along with an LCD counter.\n\nThe initial tests didnt work out well because the analog meter was stuck, so it wouldnt go beyond about 33% of full scale.\nSince there are four videos (so far), there is a good bit of information and detail about the meter. However, it is an interesting piece of gear and part 3 is interesting if you want to see inside an analog meter movement.\nBy the fourth video, things seem to be working well. You might want to browse the manual for the similar 4200A manual to get oriented.\nForgot why we measure RMS? You werent the only one. RMS conversion in meters is a big topic and there are many ways to do it.\n"}

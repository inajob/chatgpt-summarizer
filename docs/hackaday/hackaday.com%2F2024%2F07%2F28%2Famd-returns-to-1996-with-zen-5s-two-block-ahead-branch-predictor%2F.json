Which is not to say that this is necessarily a bad thing, as many of such ideas were not practical at the time. Case in point the new branch predictor in AMDs Zen 5 CPU architecture, whose two-block ahead design is based on an idea coined a few decades ago. The details are laid out by [George Cozma] and [Camacho] in a recent article, which follows on a recent interview that [George] did with AMDs [Mike Clark].\nThe 1996 ACM paper by [Andr\u00e9 Seznec] and colleagues titled Multiple-block ahead branch predictors is a good start before diving into [George]s article, as it will help to make sense of many of the details. The reason for improving the branch prediction in CPUs is fairly self-evident, as todays heavily pipelined, superscalar CPUs rely heavily on branch prediction and speculative execution to get around the glacial speeds of system memory once past the CPUs speediest caches. While predicting the next instruction block after a branch is commonly done already, this two-block ahead approach as suggested also predicts the next instruction block after the first predicted one.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this multi-block ahead branch predictor by itself isnt the hard part, but making it all fit in the hardware is. As described in the paper by [Seznec] et al., the relevant components are now dual-ported, allowing for three prediction windows. Theoretically this should result in a significant boost in IPC and could mean that more CPU manufacturers will be looking at adding such multi-block branch prediction to their designs. We will just have to see how Zen 5 works once released into the wild.", "title": "\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u6587\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\uff1aAMD Zen 5 CPU \u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668", "body": "\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u767a\u898b\u306f\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u6280\u8853\u306e\u591a\u304f\u306f\u5b9f\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u8ad6\u6587\u304b\u3089\u76d7\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002AMD\u306eZen 5 CPU\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c1\u30e3\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5206\u5c90\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668\u306f\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u5148\u8aad\u307f\u5206\u5c90\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668\u306fIPC\u3092\u5927\u5e45\u306b\u5411\u4e0a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u3002", "titles": ["\u53e4\u5178\u7684\u306a\u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u6587\u304b\u3089\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\uff1aAMD Zen 5 CPU \u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668", "ACM\u8ad6\u6587\u300cMultiple-block ahead branch predictors\u300d\uff1aCPU\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u4e88\u6e2c\u306e\u7406\u89e3\u3092\u52a9\u3051\u308b", "AMD\u3068\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\uff1aGeorge Cozma\u306e\u6700\u65b0\u8a18\u4e8b\u304c\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u5206\u5c90\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b", "CPU\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\uff1a\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u5148\u884c\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3078\u306e\u5b9f\u88c5", "Zen 5\u306e\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u5f85\u3064\uff1aIPC\u5411\u4e0a\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3055\u308c\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044CPU\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1\u4e88\u6e2c\u5668"]}

His latest design represents a breakthrough  pulling off an impressive 1 minute and 26 seconds flight on 4 liters of compressed air.\nThe model incorporates an enhanced engine design featuring an expanding seal on the piston, a concept inspired by the old Air Hogs toy plane. For the airframe, he constructed lightweight wings using 3D printed ABS ribs on a carbon spar and reinforcing rods, all of which were wrapped in heat shrink film. Additionally, [Tom] incorporated a thin balsa former along the leading edge of the wing to help maintain its shape. The fuselage is also composed of a carbon fiber tube, and is outfitted with printed fittings to install the wings, V-tail, RC electronics, and soda/air bottles. A hollow nylon bolt holds the two bottles together end-to-end while allowing the motor to be screwed directly onto the front bottle. To conserve weight, each of the two V-tail control surfaces are actuated by single cables linked to servos, with piano wire torsion springs in the hinges to maintain tension\nDespite successful flights, [Tom]s trials were not without challenges. One crash threatened severe damage to his airframe, but thanks to a central 3D printed bracket that absorbed most of the impact, total destruction was avoided. Similarly, a printed shaft saved his expensive carbon fiber propeller from being damaged during multiple landings, an outcome that led [Tom] to devise a readily replaceable consumable connector.\nA second video after the break offers a behind-the-scenes insights into this project including some fascinating technical details. For more on this projects history, take a look at the initial diaphragm engines\u00a0and his attempts to make them fly.\n\n\n", "title": "\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c17\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u98db\u884c\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a1\u520626\u79d2\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u98db\u884c\u306b\u6210\u529f", "body": "[Tom Stanton]\u304c\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c17\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u6a21\u578b\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c174\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb\u3067\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a1\u520626\u79d2\u306e\u98db\u884c\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\u306b\u306f\u53e4\u3044Air Hogs\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u304b\u3089\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u5c01\u7b52\u72b6\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u3001\u7ffc\u306f\u8efd\u91cf\u306a3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305fABS\u30ea\u30d6\u3068\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc\u3084\u88dc\u5f37\u30ed\u30c3\u30c9\u304b\u3089\u6210\u308b\u3002\u8a73\u7d30\u306f\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5727\u7e2e\u7a7a\u6c17\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u98db\u884c\u5b9f\u9a13\uff1a1\u520626\u79d2\u306e\u9a5a\u7570\u7684\u306a\u98db\u884c\u306b\u6210\u529f", "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u8efd\u91cf\u306a\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u304b\u3089\u6551\u308f\u308c\u305f3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\uff1a\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4fdd\u8b77", "\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4ea4\u63db\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u4e88\u5099\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\uff1a\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed\u30da\u30e9\u30fc\u3092\u5b88\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b", "\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u88cf\uff1a\u6280\u8853\u7684\u306a\u8a73\u7d30\u3068\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8"]}

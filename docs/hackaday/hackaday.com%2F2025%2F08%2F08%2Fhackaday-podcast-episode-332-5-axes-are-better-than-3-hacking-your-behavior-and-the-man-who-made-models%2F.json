We addressed several burning questions, such as why digital microscopes are so terrible, why computer systems seem to have so much trouble with names, and if a thermal receipt printer can cure ADHD.\nWe looked at a really slick 5-axis printer that COVID created, a temperature-controlled fermentation setup, and a pseudo-Mellotron powered by a very odd tape recorder. We also learned little about designing 3D printed parts with tight tolerances, stepping a PC power supply up to ludicrous level, and explored a trio of unique entries for the One Hertz Challenge.\nAnd for the Cant Miss section, we looked at what happens to planes when they get hit by lightning (and how they avoid it), and say goodbye to the man who launched a lot of careers by making model kits.\nIt was also exciting to learn that the first day of Supercon is Halloween, which means a Friday night sci-fi cosplay party. Its gonna be lit.\n\n\nDownload this MP3, full of twisty passages, all alike.\n\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 327 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nGet Your Tickets For Supercon 2025 Now!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nBoom, nailed it\nCongrats to [Dan Maloney] who came up with the right answer at the last second, and of course also to [Wes G]!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nOpen Source 5-Axis Printer Has Its Own Slicer\n\nNon-planar Slicing Is For The Birds\n\n\nWhy Names Break Systems\nWhy Cheap Digital Microscopes Are Pretty Terrible\n\nQuick And Dirty Microscope Motion Control For Focus Stacking\nFirst Days With A New Microscope\n\n\nA DIY Fermenter For Flavorful Brews\nThe Tape Speed Keyboard\nCan A Thermal Printer Cure ADHD?\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks\n\nSparks Fly: Building A 330 KV Supply From A PC PSU\nA Speed Loader For Your 3D Printer Filament\nHow To Design 3D-Printed Parts With Tolerance In Mind\nFire Alarm Disco Party\n\n\nDans Picks:\n\n2025 One Hertz Challenge: Blinking An LED The Very Old Fashioned Way\n2025 One Hertz Challenge: Shoulda Put A Ring Oscillator On It\n2025 One Hertz Challenge: Op-Amp Madness\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nFarewell Shunsaku Tamiya: The Man Who Gave Us The Best Things To Build\n\nThanks, Tamiya-san\n\n\nWhat Happens When Lightning Strikes A Plane?\n", "title": "- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u3068\u305d\u306e\u539f\u56e0", "body": "\u4eca\u9031\u306e\u30cf\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u306a\u3069\u3092\u8b70\u8ad6\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u9855\u5fae\u93e1\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u3068\u305d\u306e\u539f\u56e0", "- \u9769\u65b0\u7684\u306a5\u8ef8\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068DIY\u767a\u9175\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u304c\u96f7\u306b\u6253\u305f\u308c\u305f\u6642\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u901a\u3058\u3066\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30a2\u3092\u80b2\u3093\u3060\u7537\u3078\u306e\u5225\u308c", "- \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30683D\u5370\u5237\u306e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5411\u4e0a\u6cd5"]}

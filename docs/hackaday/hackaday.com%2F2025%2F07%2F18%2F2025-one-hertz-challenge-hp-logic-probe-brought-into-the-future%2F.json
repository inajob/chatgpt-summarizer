The only problem was that being 45 years old, it wasnt quite up to scratch when it came to debugging todays faster circuitry. Thus, he hacked it to do better, and entered it in our 2025 One Hertz Challenge to boot!\n[Roberts] hack relied on the classic logic probe for its stout build and form factor, which is still useful even on todays smaller hardware. Where it was lacking was in dealing with circuits running at 100 MHz and above. To rectify this, [Robert] gave the probe a brain transplant with a Sparkfun Alorium FPGA board and a small display. The FPGA is programmed to count pulses while measuring pulse widths and time, and it then drives the display to show this data to the user. Theres also a UART output, and [Robert] is actively developing further logic analyzer features, too.\nYou might be questioning how this project fits in the One Hertz Challenge, given its specifically built for running at quite high speeds. [Robert] snuck it in under the line because it resamples and updates the display on a once-a-second basis. Remember, as per the challenge site\u2014For this challenge, we want you to design a device where something happens once per second. Were giving you a lot of leeway here!\nOften, old scopes and probes and other gear are really well built. Sometimes, its worth taking the best of the old physical hardware and combining it with modern upgrades to make something stout thats still useful today. Meanwhile, if youre cooking up your own neo-retro-logic probes, dont hesitate to notify the tipsline!\n \n\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u7526\u3089\u305b\u308b \u2013 Robert\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u53e4\u3044\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u56de\u8def\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002FPGA\u3092\u7528\u3044\u3066\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u5411\u4e0a\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u73fe\u4ee3\u306b\u7526\u3089\u305b\u308b \u2013 Robert\u306e\u30cf\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- 45\u5e74\u524d\u306e\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u3092FPGA\u3067\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u9ad8\u901f\u56de\u8def\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u6539\u9020", "- One Hertz Challenge\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u8868\u793a\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u73fe\u4ee3\u6280\u8853\u306e\u878d\u5408"]}

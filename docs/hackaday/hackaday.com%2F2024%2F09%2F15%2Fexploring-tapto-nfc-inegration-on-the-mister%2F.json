This allows an NFC card to be programmed with the required FPGA core and game image. The TapTo service runs on the MiSTer, waiting for NFC events and launching the appropriate actions when it reads a card. [Ken] demonstrates many such usage scenarios, from launching games quickly and easily with a physical game card to adding arcade credits and even activating cheat codes.\nAs [Ken] points out, this opens some exciting possibilities concerning physical interactivity and would be a real bonus for people less able-bodied to access these gaming systems. It was fun to see how the Nintendo Amiibo figures and some neat integration projects like the dummy floppy disk drive could be used.\nTapTo is a software project primarily for the MiSTer system, but ports are underway for Windows, the MiSTex, and theres a working Commodore 64 game loader using the TeensyROM, which supports TapTo. For more information, check out the TapTo project GitHub page.\nWeve covered the MiSTer\u00a0a few times before, but boy, do we have a lot of NFC hacks. Heres an\u00a0NFC ring\u00a0and a\u00a0DIY NFC tag,\u00a0just for starters.\n\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip!", "title": "MiSTer\u3068TapTo\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "YouTube\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30ebWhats Ken Making\u306eKen\u304cMiSTer\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305fTapTo\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002 NFC\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8d77\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3001\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u6709\u52b9\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6027\u3092\u9ad8\u3081\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "titles": ["MiSTer\u3068TapTo\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "NFC\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u8d77\u52d5\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1aTapTo\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "MiSTer\u3067\u7269\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1aTapTo\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u697d\u3057\u307f", "NFC\u6280\u8853\u3068MiSTer\u306e\u9769\u65b0\u7684\u7d50\u5408"]}

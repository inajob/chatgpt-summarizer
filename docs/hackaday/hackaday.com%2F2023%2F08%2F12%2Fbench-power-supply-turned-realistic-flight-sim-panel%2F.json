Theres a dizzying array of switches and buttons that you can fiddle with in your aircrafts virtual cockpit, but doing it with the same keyboard that you use to hammer out code or write Hackaday articles doesnt do much for immersion.\nLooking to improve on the situation without having to shell out for an expensive sim panel, [Michael Fitzmayer] decided to convert a broken Manson SSP-8160 lab power supply into a fairly good approximation of the KAP 140 autopilot system which is used in one of his favorite aircraft, the Pilatus PC-6 Turbo-Porter.\n[Michael] gutted the piece of equipment pretty thoroughly, only leaving behind the case itself and the illuminated button panel on the front. The original displays were replaced with TM1637 seven-segment LEDs, and a pair of new rotary encoders are mounted where the stock knobs were. The whole show is run by a STM32F103 Blue Pill, which conveys the button pressing and knob spinning to the game by mimicking a USB Human Interface Device.\nA fascia applied to the front of the power supply blocks the original text and labels, and really makes the finished unit look the part. [Michael] admits its not 100% accurate to the layout of the real hardware, but its certainly better than trying to enter heading and altitude information with the controller.\nOh thats right, did we mention hes actually using this on the Xbox Series S? While we generally see this sort of sim hardware hooked up to a tricked out gaming computer, we appreciate that hes trying to bring some of that same experience to the console world. While USB HID does bring with it some limitations  for example you need to manually zero out the hardware at the start of each flight since the game cant change the state of the physical displays  theres still a lot of potential here.\nFor example, you could design and build your own flight yoke, pedals, and throttles rather than spending hundreds on a commercial version. It sounds like [Michael] is just getting started in the world of affordable console-based flight simulation, and were very eager to see where he goes from here.", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "2020\u5e74\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u306a\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u3001\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30e9\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u6027\u306e\u9762\u3067\u3082\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002Michael\u306f\u5ec3\u68c4\u4e88\u5b9a\u306e\u96fb\u6e90\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u6539\u9020\u3057\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u4f5c\u306e\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306f\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306b\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3068\u30ed\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30b3\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0\u3057\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306bUSB HID\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5165\u529b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306bSTM32F103 Blue Pill\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5f7c\u306fXbox Series S\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u306e\u98db\u884c\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3082\u89e6\u308c\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7528\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30af\u30f3\u96fb\u6e90\u4f9b\u7d66\u88c5\u7f6e\u3092\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u8ee2\u7528", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d1\u30a4\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u518d\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "Xbox\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u5411\u3051\u306e\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

We also watched Star Trek and thought how cool it would be to talk to our computer. From Kirk setting a self-destruct sequence, to Scotty talking into a mouse, or Picard ordering Earl Grey, we intuitively know that talking to a computer is better than typing, right? Well, computers talking back and forth to us is no longer science fiction, and maybe we arent as happy about it as we thought wed be.\nWe werent able to pinpoint the first talking computer in fiction. Asimov and van Vogt had talking computers in the 1940s. I, Robot by Eando Binder, and not the more famous Asimov story, had a fully speaking robot in 1939. You could argue that The Machine in E. M. Forsters The Machine Stops was probably speaking  the text is a little vague  and that was in 1909. The robot from Metropolis (1927) spoke after transforming, but you could argue that doesnt count.\nMeanwhile, In Real Life\nIn real life, computers werent as quick to speak. Before the middle of the twentieth century, machine-generated speech was an oddity. In 1779, a mechanical contrivance by Wolfgang von Kempelen, famous for the mechanical Turk chess-playing automaton, could form simple words. By 1939, Bell Labs could do even better speech synthesis electronically but with a human operator. It didnt sound very good, as you can see in the video below, but it was certainly expressive.\n\n\nSpeech recognition would wait until 1952, when Bell Labs showed a system that required training to understand someone speaking numbers. IBM could recognize 16 different utterances in 1961 with Shoebox, and, of course, that same year, they made an IBM 704 sing Daisy Bell, which would later inspire HAL 9000 to do the same.\n\nRecent advances in neural network systems and other AI techniques mean that now computers can generate and understand speech at a level even most fiction didnt anticipate. These days, it is trivially easy to interact with your phone or your PC by using your voice. Of course, we sometimes question if every device needs AI smarts and a voice. We can maybe do without a smart toaster, for instance.\nSo Whats the Problem?\nPatrick Blowers famous cartoon about Amazon buying Whole Foods is both funny and tragically possible. In it, Jeff Bezos says, Alexa, buy me something from Whole Foods. To which Alexa replies, Sure, Jeff. Buying Whole Foods. Misunderstandings are one of the problems with voice input.\nEvery night, I say exactly the same phrase right before I go to sleep: Hey, Google. Play my playlist sleep list. About seven times out of ten, I get my playlist going. Two times out of ten, I get childrens lullabies or something even stranger. Occasionally, for variety, I get Something went wrong. Try again later. You can, of course, make excuses for this. The technology is new. Maybe my bedroom is noisy or has lousy acoustics. But still.\nThats not the only problem. Science fiction often predicts the future and, generally, newer science fiction is closer than older science fiction. But Star Trek sometimes turns that on its head. Picard had an office. Kirk worked out of his quarters at a time when working from home was almost unheard of. Offices are a forgotten luxury for many people, and if you are working from home, thats fine. But if you are in a call center, a bullpen, or the bridge of the Enterprise, all this yakking back and forth with your computer will drive everyone crazy. Even if you train the computer to only recognize the users voice, it will still annoy you to have to hear everyone elses notifications, messages, and alerts.\nToday, humans are still better at understanding people than computers are. We all have a friend who consistently mispronounces Arduino, but we still know what he means. Or the colleague with a very thick accent, like Checkov trying to enter authorization code wictor wictor two in the recent movie. You knew what he meant, too.\n\nSome of the problems are social. I cant tell you the number of times Im in the middle of dictating an e-mail, and someone just comes up and starts talking to me, which then shows up in the middle of my sentence. Granted, thats not a computer issue. But it is another example of why voice input systems are not always as delightful as youd think.\nSolutions?\nProbably got great battery life.\nSure, maybe you could build a cone of silence over each station, but that has its own problems. Then again, Spock and Uhuru sometimes wore the biggest Bluetooth Earbud ever, so maybe thats half of the answer. The other half could be subvocalization, but thats mostly science fiction, although not entirely.\nWhat do you think? Even telepathy probably has some downsides. Youd have to be careful what you think, right? What is the ideal human-computer interface? Or will future Star Fleet officers be typing on molecular keyboards? Or will it wind up all in our brains?

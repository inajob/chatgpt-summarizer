[Sebastian Duell]\u2019s FlyingCam hijacks an IKEA lamp gooseneck to become something you never knew you needed: a wireless camera for short-term random remote observation. It\u2019s a beautiful combination of 3D printing and commercial device re-use, and when paired with his DIY wireless screen, it\u2019s a complete solution.\nThe guts of this project aren\u2019t critical, or expensive. It\u2019s built around one of those ESP32 single-board webcams, with an added fan, battery pack, antenna, and a power switch. You turn it on, and the AP in the ESP32 fires up, or optionally connects to your network. Point the camera at your target and you\u2019re set, at least if you want to sit by your computer. But [Sebastian] also designed a nice simple remote screen, so you can keep tabs on your spaghetti wherever you roam around the house.\nWe love the attention to keeping the design simple here, both in form and in function. It\u2019s a one-task device, so it\u2019s important that it be extremely easy to use, and it\u2019s hard to beat just pointing the thing and turning on a switch. And it doesnt hurt that its good looking to boot.\nIKEA stuff is cheap and cheerful, but often it\u2019s missing just that one functionality that we want. What good is an air-quality sensor without MQTT logging capability, for instance? Or a standing desk that can\u2019t remember set heights? Get hacking!"}

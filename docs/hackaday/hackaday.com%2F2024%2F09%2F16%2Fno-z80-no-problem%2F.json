This chip had a huge influence on both desktop and embedded computing that lingers to this day, but its fair to say that the market for it has dwindled. If you have a retrocomputer then, whats to be done? If youre [Dean Netherton], you create a processor card for the popular RC2014 retrocomputer backplane, carrying the eZ80, a successor chip thats still in production.\nThe eZ80 can be thought of as a Z80 system-on-chip, with microcontroller-style peripherals, RAM, and Flash memory on board. Its much faster than the original and can address a relatively huge 16MB of memory. For this board, hes put the chip on a processor daughterboard that plugs into a CPU card with a set of latches to drive the slower RC2014 bus. We cant help drawing analogies with some of the 16-bit upgrades to 8-bit platforms back in the day, which used similar tactics.\nSo this wont save the Z80, but it might well give a new dimension to Z80 hacking. Meanwhile, were sure there remain enough of the 40-pin chips out there to keep hackers going for many years to come if you prefer the original.

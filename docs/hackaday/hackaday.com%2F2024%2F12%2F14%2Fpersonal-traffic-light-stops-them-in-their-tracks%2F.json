Except theyre in pajamas instead of business casual.\nSo, whats the answer? Many times its not practical to stop what youre doing, especially just to communicate that youre busy. We suppose you could glare at them, put up your hand, or even give a dismissive wave, but a better solution might be this mood signal built by [gokux].\nThrough a simple web app, you can be red to indicate that youre super busy, yellow to mean busy-ish, and green for lets gossip about the cats.\nThis mood indicator is built on the Seeed Xiao ESP32-C3 and shows the given mood indicator on a small matrix of sixteen WS2812B LEDs. Its powered by a 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery and a small push button switch. As usual, [gokux] has grade-A instructions for building your own version of this slick solution.\nWould you like something more tactile and low-tech?

[Aaed Musa]s latest project is CARA, a robotic dog made mostly of 3D printed parts, with brushless motors and ropes used to tie the motors and legs together.\nIn a previous post, we covered [Aaed Musa]s use of rope as a mechanism to make capstan drives, enabling high torque and little to no backlash. Taking that gearbox design, tweaking it a bit, and using three motors, he was able to make a leg capable of moving in all three axes. He had to do a good deal of inverse kinematics math to get the leg moving around as desired; once he had the motion of a step defined, it was time to build the rest of the dog.\nCARA is made primarily of 3D printed parts, with several carbon fiber tubes running its length for rigidity. The legs are all free to move not only forward and back but side to side some, as in a real dog. He uses 12 large brushless motors, as they provide the torque needed, and ODrive S1 motor controllers to control each one, controlled over CAN by a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. There is also a small BNO086 IMU to sense CARAs position relative to gravity, and a 24V cordless tool battery powers everything.\nOnce assembled, there was some more tuning of what type of motion CARAs legs take while walking. There were a few tweaks to the printed parts to address some structural issues, and then a good deal more inverse kinematics math to make full use of the IMU, allowing CARA to handle inclines and make a much more natural movement style. [Aaed Musa] does a great job explaining his approach on his site as well as in the video below; were looking forward to seeing his future projects!\nCARA isnt alone on this site\u2014be sure to check out the other robot dogs weve featured here.\n\n", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cCARA\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72acCARA\u306f\u3001\u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u52d5\u529b\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u52d5\u304d\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u300cCARA\u300d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u30ed\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u305f\u72ac\u578b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u52d5\u529b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0", "- \u30a4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u99c6\u4f7f\u3057\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u306e\u6b69\u884c\u52d5\u4f5c", "- \u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u5f37\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08", "- \u4ed6\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u72ac\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3068\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\u3068\u5c55\u671b"]}

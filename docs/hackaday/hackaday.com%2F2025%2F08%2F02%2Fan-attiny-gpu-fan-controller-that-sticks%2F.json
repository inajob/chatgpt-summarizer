Well, [ashafq] did the latter. The result is a delightfully nerdy fan controller powered by an ATTiny85 and governed by a DS18B20 temperature sensor. We all know a silent workstation is golden, and theres no fun in throwing money at an off-the-shelf solution. [ashafq]s custom build transforms a whiny Radeon RX 550 into a cool, quiet operator. Best of all: it\u2019s built from bits likely already in your junk drawer.\nTo challenge himself a bit, [ashafq] rolled his own temperature-triggered PWM logic using 1-wire protocol on an ATtiny85, all without libraries or bloated firmware. The fan\u2019s speed only ramps up when the GPU gets toasty, just like it should. Its efficient and clever, and that makes it a fine hack. The entire system runs off a scavenged 12V fan. He could have used a 3D printer, but decided to stick onto the card with double-sided tape. McGyver would approve.\nThe results dont lie: idle temps at 40\u202f\u00b0C, load peaking at 60\u202f\u00b0C. Quieter than stock, smarter than stock, and way cheaper too. The double-sided tape may not last, but that leaves room for improvement. In case you want to start on it yourself, read the full write-up and feel inspired to build your own. Hackaday.io is ready for the documentation of your take on it.\nModifying fans is a tradition around here. Does it always take a processor? Nope."}

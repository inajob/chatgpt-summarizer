They offer a level of robustness and reliability missing in many cheaper machines. You may not be surprised to find that this article is being written on one. With such a following, its not surprising that a significant effort has gone into upgrading older models. For example, we have [Franck Deng]s new motherboard for the Thinkpad X200 and X201. These models from the end of the 2000s shipped as far as we can remember with Core 2 Duo processors, so we can imagine they would be starting to feel their age.\nIts fair to say the new board isnt a cheap option, but it does come with a new Core Ultra 7 CPU, DDR5 memory, M.2 interfaces for SSDs alongside the original 2.5 device, and USB-C with Thunderbolt support. There are a range of screen upgrade options. For an even more hefty price, you can buy a completely rebuilt laptop featuring the new board. Were impressed with the work, but we have to wonder how it would stack up against a newer Thinkpad for the price.\nIf youre curious to see more of the same, this isnt the first such upgrade weve seen.\nThanks [Max] for the tip.", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044Thinkpad\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "body": "Thinkpad\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u5411\u4e0a\u3082\u9ad8\u4fa1\u683c\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044Thinkpad\u3092\u8607\u3089\u305b\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9", "- Thinkpad X200/X201\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u5237\u65b0\u3059\u308b\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\uff1f\u65b0\u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u642d\u8f09Thinkpad\u306e\u5b9f\u529b", "- Lenovo\u88fdThinkpad\u306e\u9032\u5316\u3068\u5fa9\u6d3b\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u6700\u65b0\u6280\u8853\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f\u30ea\u30d3\u30eb\u30c8Thinkpad\u306e\u9b45\u529b"]}

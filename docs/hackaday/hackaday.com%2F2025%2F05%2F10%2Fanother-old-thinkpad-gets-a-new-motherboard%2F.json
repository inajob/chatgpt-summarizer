They offer a level of robustness and reliability missing in many cheaper machines. You may not be surprised to find that this article is being written on one. With such a following, its not surprising that a significant effort has gone into upgrading older models. For example, we have [Franck Deng]s new motherboard for the Thinkpad X200 and X201. These models from the end of the 2000s shipped as far as we can remember with Core 2 Duo processors, so we can imagine they would be starting to feel their age.\nIts fair to say the new board isnt a cheap option, but it does come with a new Core Ultra 7 CPU, DDR5 memory, M.2 interfaces for SSDs alongside the original 2.5 device, and USB-C with Thunderbolt support. There are a range of screen upgrade options. For an even more hefty price, you can buy a completely rebuilt laptop featuring the new board. Were impressed with the work, but we have to wonder how it would stack up against a newer Thinkpad for the price.\nIf youre curious to see more of the same, this isnt the first such upgrade weve seen.\nThanks [Max] for the tip."}

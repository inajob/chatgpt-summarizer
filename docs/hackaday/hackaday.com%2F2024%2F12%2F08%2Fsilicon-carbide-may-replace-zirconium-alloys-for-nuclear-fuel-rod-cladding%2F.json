Mechanically robust and corrosion-resistant zirconium alloy (zircalloy) tubes are filled with ceramic fuel pellets, which get assembled into fuel assemblies for loading into the reactor.\nA 12 SiGa fuel assembly, demonstrating the ability to scale to full-sized fuel rods. (Credit: DoE)\nNow it seems that silicon carbide (SiC) may soon replace the traditional zirconium alloy with General Atomics SiGa fuel cladding, which has been tested over the past 120 days in the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). This completes the first of a series of tests before SiGa is approved for commercial use.\nOne of the main advantages of\u00a0SiC over zircalloy is better resistance to high temperatures  during testing with temperatures well above those experienced with normal operating conditions, the zircalloy rods would burst while the SiC ones remained intact (as in the embedded video). Although normally SiC is quite brittle and unsuitable for such structures, SiGa uses SiC fibers, which allows it to be used in this structural fashion.\nAlthough this development is primarily part of the Department of Energys Accident Tolerant Fuel Program and its focus on melt-down proof fuel, the switch to SiC could also solve a major issue with zirconium, being its use as a catalyst with hydrogen formation when exposed to steam. Although with e.g. Fukushima Daiichis triple meltdown the zircalloy fuel rods were partially destroyed, it was the formation of hydrogen gas inside the reactor vessels and the hydrogen explosions during venting which worsened what should have been a simple meltdown into something significantly worse.\n\n"}

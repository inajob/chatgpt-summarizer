In fact, its possible to achieve much more complex tasks in the shell. As an example, heres [calebccf] with an emulated 6502 system in a busybox ash shell script.\nWhats in the emulator? A simple 6502 system with RAM, ROM, and an emulated serial port on STDIO. It comes with the wozmon Apple 1 monitor and BASIC, making for a very mid-1970s experience. Theres even a built-in monitor and debugger, which from our memories of debugging hand-assembled 8-bit code back in the day, should be extremely useful.\nAlthough the default machine has a generous 32k of RAM and 16k ROM, you can easily adjust these limits by editing machine.sh. In addition, you can get a log of execution via a socket if you like. Dont expect it to run too fast, and we did have to adjust the #! line to get it to run on our system (we pointed it to bash, but your results may vary).\nWhat you use this for is up to you, but were sure youll all agree its an impressive feat in the shell. Its not the first time weve seen some impressive feats there, though. Our Linux Fu column does a lot with the shell if you want further inspiration.", "title": "- \u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a6502\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f6502\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002RAM\u3084ROM\u3092\u5099\u3048\u3001\u30c7\u30d0\u30c3\u30b0\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\uff1a6502\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb", "- \u7c21\u5358\u306a\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- 1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4f53\u9a13\u3092\u518d\u73fe\uff1a\u30ef\u30ba\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3068BASIC\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3057\u305f6502\u30a8\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf", "- RAM\u3084ROM\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\uff1a\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u5909\u66f4\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\uff1aLinux Fu\u306e\u3055\u3089\u306a\u308b\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8"]}

This week, they found plenty of Hackaday posts to discuss, ranging from exotic eavesdropping on keyboards, oscilloscopes, and several posts of interest to anyone who wants to build good-looking prototypes. If you are like mechanics, youll hear about an escapement-like mechanism and a Hobsons coupler. If you crave more traditional hacks, you can learn more about maximizing battery life and etching PCBs.\nIn addition to a flurry of hacks, Elliot and Al also share their picks for the best original posts from Hackadays staff. This week, we find out how Arya Voronova documents projects and hear what Tom Nardi thinks of his Beepy  a ready-made display and Blackberry keyboard waiting for a Raspberry Pi.\nDid you miss anything?

His recent entry looks at vertical or VFETs, which are, as he puts it, a JFET that thinks it is a triode. He clearly explains how the transistor works as a conductor unless you bias the gate to form a depletion zone.\nThe transistors have a short channel, which means they conduct quite well. The low gate resistance and capacitance mean the devices can also switch very quickly. These devices were once in vogue for audio applications. However, theyd fallen out of favor until recently. The reason is that they work quite well in switching power supplies.\nHow good is the on resistance? So good that his meter reported the probes were shorted instead of measuring the resistance. Pretty good. Weve seen these VFET transistors used as switches to drive magnetic field coils many years ago and they replaced much more complex circuitry.\nThe curve tracer in the video is a beautiful instrument of its own. The digital displays give it a high tech yet retro look. A curve tracer, if you havent used one, plots stepped voltages against current flowing, and is very useful for examining semiconductor devices. While not as fancy, it is possible to make one to connect to a scope quite easily.\nWe are pretty sure that it is a Tektronix 576. We watched a repair of a similar unit, the 577, if youd like to see some (probably) similar insides.\n\n"}

Despite this, the hoodlums who staged a violent uprising against British rule in the American colonies have somehow made their uncouth dialect dominant in the information technologies that have taken the world by storm these past decades. In this urgent mission to restore the Kings English to its rightful place, we fortunately have patriotic British citizens who have taken it upon themselves to correct this grave injustice. Brave citizens such as [Declan Chidlow], whose BritCSS project is a bright beacon in these harrowing times.\nImplemented as a simple, 14 kB JavaScript script to be included in an HTML page, it allows one to write CSS files using proper spelling, such as background-colour and centre. Meanwhile harsh language such as !important is replaced with the more pleasant !if-you-would-be-so-kind. It is expected that although for now this script has to be included on each page to use BritCSS, native support will soon be implemented in every browser, superseding the US dialect version. [Declan] has also been recommended to be awarded the Order of the British Empire for his outstanding services.", "title": "\u30d6ritCSS\uff1a\u82f1\u56fd\u8a9e\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304fCSS\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "body": "\u7c73\u56fd\u306e\u82f1\u8a9e\u304c\u652f\u914d\u3059\u308b\u4e2d\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u5f0f\u82f1\u8a9e\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u304c\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["\u30d6ritCSS\uff1a\u82f1\u56fd\u8a9e\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304fCSS\u306e\u63d0\u6848", "\u82f1\u56fd\u306e\u8a87\u308a\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u623b\u3059\uff1aDeclan Chidlow\u306e\u6311\u6226", "CSS\u3067\u306e\u7db4\u308a\u76f4\u3057\uff1a\u512a\u96c5\u306a\u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u5fa9\u6a29", "!important\u3092\uff01if-you-would-be-so-kind\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30b6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u82f1\u56fd\u5f0fCSS\u306e\u672a\u6765\u5c55\u671b"]}

But [Chuck] found an interesting project on GitHub from [Andrew Sink] that will let you add a variable amount of twist to any STL and then return it to you for printing or whatever else you use STLs for. If you dont get what we mean, check out the video below.\nThe site that does the work initially loads a little gnome figure if you are too lazy to upload your own model. Thats perfect, though, because the little guy is a good example of why you might want to twist a model. With just a little work, you can make the gnome look in one direction or even look behind him.\n[Chuck] shows how to use the tool for artistic effect by twisting his standard cube logo. The result is something that looks like it would be difficult to create, but could hardly be easier. The tool lets you rotate the object, too, so you can get the twist effect in the right orientation for what you want to accomplish. A great little tool for making more artistic 3D prints without learning new software. If you want some fun, you can try the version that uses sound from your microphone to control the twist.\nIf youd rather twist in CAD, we can help. If you really want artsy 3D printing, you probably need to learn Blender.\n\n", "title": "STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u3072\u306d\u308a\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u30663D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "body": "STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u3001\u306d\u3058\u308c\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3002\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u306d\u3058\u308a\u3001\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u30ed\u30b4\u3082\u306d\u3058\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30023D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u5909\u3048\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3002Blender\u3092\u5b66\u3070\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u3072\u306d\u308a\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u30663D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u3072\u306d\u3063\u3066\u30a2\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059", "GitHub\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u5909\u5f62\u3055\u305b\u308b", "STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u3092\u5909\u5f62\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u7d39\u4ecb", "\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066STL\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u3072\u306d\u308a\u3092\u52a0\u3048\u308b"]}

If you have a vector network analyzer (VNA)  or even some basic test equipment  you can use it to learn the parameters of a crystal. [All Electronics Channel] has the details, and you can see how in the video below.\nThere was a time when a VNA was an exotic piece of gear, but these days they are relatively common. Crystal parameters are important because crystals have a series resonance and a parallel resonance and they are not at the same frequency. You also may need to know how much loading capacitance you have to supply to get the crystal at the right frequency.\nSometimes, you want to pull the crystal frequency, and the parameters will help you figure that out, too. It can also help if you have a crystal specified as series in a parallel-mode oscillator or vice versa.\nIf you dont have a VNA, you can use a tracking signal generator, as [Gr\u00e9gory] shows towards the middle of the video. The quality of a tuned circuit depends on the Q factor, and crystals have a very high Q factor.\nWe did something similar in 2018. The other way to pull a crystal frequency is a bit extreme.\n\n"}

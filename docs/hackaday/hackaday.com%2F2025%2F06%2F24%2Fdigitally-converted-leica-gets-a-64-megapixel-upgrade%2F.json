[Michael Suguitan] has previously had great success converting his classic Leica into a digital one, and now hes taken the project even further.\n[Michaels] previous work saw him create a so-called digital back for the Leica M2. He fitted the classic camera with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a small imaging sensor to effectively turn it into a digital camera, creating what he called the LeicaMPi. Since then, [Michael] has made a range of upgrades to create what he calls the LeicaM2Pi.\nThe upgrades start with the image sensor. This time around, instead of using a generic Raspberry Pi camera, hes gone with the fancier ArduCam OwlSight sensor. Boasting a mighty 64 megapixels, its still largely compatible with all the same software tools as the first-party cameras, making it both capable and easy to use. With a\u00a0 crop factor of 3.7x, the cameras Voigtlander 12mm lens has a much more useful field of view.\nUnlike [Michaels] previous setup, there was also no need to remove the cameras IR filter to clear the shutter mechanism. This means the new camera is capable of taking natural color photos during the day.\u00a0 [Michael] also added a flash this time around, controlled by the GPIOs of the Raspberry Pi Zero. The camera also features a much tidier onboard battery via the PiSugar module, which can be easily recharged with a USB-C cable.\nIf youve ever thought about converting an old-school film camera into a digital shooter, [Michaels] work might serve as a great jumping off point. Weve seen it done with DSLRs, before, too! Video after the break.\n\n\n[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]", "title": "- \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "body": "\u53e4\u3044\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3057\u305f\u6210\u529f\u4f8b\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u306b\u5909\u8eab\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- Raspberry Pi\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30abM2\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316", "- 64\u30e1\u30ac\u30d4\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u306eArduCam OwlSight\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3092\u642d\u8f09", "- \u65e5\u4e2d\u306e\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u8272\u5408\u3044\u3067\u64ae\u5f71\u3067\u304d\u308b\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2"]}

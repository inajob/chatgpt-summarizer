The physical operation isn\u2019t too complicated, however, and as [Farben-X] shows, it\u2019s entirely possible to build an X-ray diffractometer if you\u2019re willing to deal with high voltages, ancient X-ray tubes, and soft X-rays.\n[Farben-X] based his diffractometer around an old Soviet BSV-29 structural analysis X-ray tube, which emits X-rays through four beryllium windows. Two ZVS drivers power the tube: one to drive the electron gun\u2019s filament, and one to feed a flyback transformer and Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplier which generate a potential across the tube. The most important part of the imaging system is the X-ray collimator, which [Farben-X] made out of a lead disk with a copper tube mounted in it. A 3D printer nozzle screws into each end of the tube, creating a very narrow path for X-rays, and thus a thin, mostly collimated beam.\nTo get good diffraction patterns from a crystal, it needed to be a single crystal, and to actually let the X-ray beam pass through, it needed to be a thin crystal. For this, [Farben-X] selected a sodium chloride crystal, a menthol crystal, and a thin sheet of mica. To grow large salt crystals, he used solvent vapor diffusion, which slowly dissolves a suitable solvent vapor in a salt solution, which decreases the salt\u2019s solubility, leading to very slow, fine crystal growth. Afterwards, he redissolved portions of the resulting crystal to make it thinner.\nThe diffraction pattern generated by a sodium chloride crystal.\nFor the actual experiment, [Farben-X] passed the X-ray beam through the crystals, then recorded the diffraction patterns formed on a slide of X-ray sensitive film. This created a pattern of dots around the central beam, indicating diffracted beams. The mathematics for reverse-engineering the crystal structure from this is rather complicated, and [Farben-X] hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet, but it should be possible.\nWe would recommend a great deal of caution to anyone considering replicating this \u2013 a few clips of X-rays inducing flashes in the camera sensor made us particularly concerned \u2013 but we do have to admire any hack that coaxed such impressive results out of such a rudimentary setup. If you\u2019re interested in further reading, we\u2019ve covered the basics of X-ray crystallography before. We\u2019ve also seen a few X-ray machines.\n"}

The physical operation isn\u2019t too complicated, however, and as [Farben-X] shows, it\u2019s entirely possible to build an X-ray diffractometer if you\u2019re willing to deal with high voltages, ancient X-ray tubes, and soft X-rays.\n[Farben-X] based his diffractometer around an old Soviet BSV-29 structural analysis X-ray tube, which emits X-rays through four beryllium windows. Two ZVS drivers power the tube: one to drive the electron gun\u2019s filament, and one to feed a flyback transformer and Cockroft-Walton voltage multiplier which generate a potential across the tube. The most important part of the imaging system is the X-ray collimator, which [Farben-X] made out of a lead disk with a copper tube mounted in it. A 3D printer nozzle screws into each end of the tube, creating a very narrow path for X-rays, and thus a thin, mostly collimated beam.\nTo get good diffraction patterns from a crystal, it needed to be a single crystal, and to actually let the X-ray beam pass through, it needed to be a thin crystal. For this, [Farben-X] selected a sodium chloride crystal, a menthol crystal, and a thin sheet of mica. To grow large salt crystals, he used solvent vapor diffusion, which slowly dissolves a suitable solvent vapor in a salt solution, which decreases the salt\u2019s solubility, leading to very slow, fine crystal growth. Afterwards, he redissolved portions of the resulting crystal to make it thinner.\nThe diffraction pattern generated by a sodium chloride crystal.\nFor the actual experiment, [Farben-X] passed the X-ray beam through the crystals, then recorded the diffraction patterns formed on a slide of X-ray sensitive film. This created a pattern of dots around the central beam, indicating diffracted beams. The mathematics for reverse-engineering the crystal structure from this is rather complicated, and [Farben-X] hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet, but it should be possible.\nWe would recommend a great deal of caution to anyone considering replicating this \u2013 a few clips of X-rays inducing flashes in the camera sensor made us particularly concerned \u2013 but we do have to admire any hack that coaxed such impressive results out of such a rudimentary setup. If you\u2019re interested in further reading, we\u2019ve covered the basics of X-ray crystallography before. We\u2019ve also seen a few X-ray machines.\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u4f5cX\u7dda\u56de\u6298\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u3080", "body": "X\u7dda\u7d50\u6676\u89e3\u6790\u88c5\u7f6e\u306e\u81ea\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002\u53e4\u3044X\u7dda\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u3001\u7d50\u6676\u304b\u3089\u56de\u6298\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u306b\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u4f5cX\u7dda\u56de\u6298\u8a08\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u6311\u3080", "- \u53e4\u3044\u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8\u88fdX\u7dda\u7ba1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c", "- \u7d50\u6676\u306e\u56de\u6298\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u8a18\u9332\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5", "- \u5869\u7d50\u6676\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305fX\u7dda\u5b9f\u9a13\u306e\u5b9f\u8df5", "- DIY\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7269\u8cea\u7279\u6027\u306e\u7406\u89e3"]}

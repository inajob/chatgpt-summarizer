Stairs, of course, are the obvious problem. But realistic blinking behavior is harder than you might think. At first, it might seem frivolous and simple to have a robot blink, but according to Italian scientists, it is both more important and more difficult than you probably think.\nBlinking is a nonverbal cue when humans communicate. The post quotes a Finnish researcher:\nWhile it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction.\n\nThe researchers found that both 13-year-old and adult subjects like blinking robots more. Apparently, a robot that doesnt blink makes people feel stared at  sorry HAL.\nThe researchers also note that blinking is subtle, so getting it right isnt easy and requires high-precision motors. They mention that making it move fast and look realistic takes a lot of work. We wonder, however, if an LCD-rendered eye could blink very effectively and at a lower cost. After all, the eye doesnt have to be the robots actual camera. Regardless, the researchers point out that if the blinking isnt natural, it appears odd and disturbing.\nWeve seen plenty of blinking eye mechanisms. They dont have to be overly complicated.", "title": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u76ee\u3092\u77ac\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "body": "\u76ee\u3092\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u3059\u308b\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u89aa\u3057\u307f\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u308a\u3001\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u597d\u611f\u3092\u6301\u305f\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3060\u304c\u3001\u307e\u3070\u305f\u304d\u306f\u5fae\u5999\u306a\u52d5\u4f5c\u3067\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001LCD\u8868\u793a\u306e\u76ee\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u4e0b\u3052\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u76ee\u3092\u77ac\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u7814\u7a76", "\u77ac\u304d\u306f\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u4eba\u9593\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u5fc5\u8981", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u81ea\u7136\u306a\u77ac\u304d\u3092\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306b\u306f\u9ad8\u3044\u7cbe\u5ea6\u306e\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981", "\u76ee\u3092\u77ac\u304b\u306a\u3044\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u306b\u611f\u3058\u308b", "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u76ee\u3092\u77ac\u304b\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u3042\u308b"]}

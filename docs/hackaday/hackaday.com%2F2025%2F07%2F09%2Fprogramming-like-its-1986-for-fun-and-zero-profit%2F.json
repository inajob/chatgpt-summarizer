But there are veritable children involved too  take the [ComputerSmith], who is recreating Conways game of life on a Macintosh Plus that could very well be as old as his parents. If theres any nostalgia here, its at least a generation removed  thus proving for the haters that theres more than a misplaced desire to relive ones youth in exploring these ancient machines.\nSo what does a young person get out of programming on a 1980s Mac? Well, aside from internet clout, and possible YouTube monetization, theres the sheer intellectual challenge of the thing. You cant go sniffing around StackExchange or LLMs for code to copy-paste when writing C for a 1986 machine, not if youre going to be fully authentic. ANSI C only dates to 1987, after all, and figuring out the quirks and foibles of the specific C implementation is both half the fun, and not easily outsourced. Object Pascal would also have been an option (and quite likely more straightforward  at least the language was clearly-defined), but [ComputerSmith] seems to think the exercise will improve his chops with C, and hes likely to be right.\u00a0\nApparently [ComputerSmith] brought this project to VCS Southwest, so anyone who was there doesnt have to wait for Part 2 of the video to show up to see how this turns out, or to snag a copy of the code (which was apparently available on diskette). If you were there, let us know if you spotted the youngest Macintosh Plus programmer, and if you scored a disk from him.\nIf the idea of coding in this era tickles the dopamine receptors, check out this how-to for a prizewinning Amiga demo.\u00a0 If you think pre-ANSI C isnt retro enough, perhaps youd prefer programming by card?\n\n", "title": "- \u82e5\u8005\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306f\u4e16\u4ee3\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u305f\u6311\u6226\u3067\u3001\u82e5\u8005\u3082\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- \u82e5\u8005\u3082\u6311\u6226\u3059\u308b\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u53e4\u5178\u7684\u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3067\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u697d\u3057\u3055", "- 1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u306eC\u8a00\u8a9e\u306b\u6311\u3080\uff01\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- \u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u4e16\u4ee3\u9593\u30ae\u30e3\u30c3\u30d7", "- \u30de\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u3067\u306e\u5275\u9020\u7684\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

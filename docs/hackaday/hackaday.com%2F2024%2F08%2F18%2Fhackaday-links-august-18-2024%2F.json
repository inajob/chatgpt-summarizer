The San Francisco autonomous vehicle hijinks, that is, as Waymos fleet of driverless cars recently took up the fun new hobby of honking their horns in the wee hours of the morning. Meat-based neighbors of a Waymo parking lot in the South Market neighborhood took offense at the fleet of autonomous vehicles sounding off at 4:00 AM as they shuffled themselves around in the parking lot in a slow-motion ballet of undetermined purpose. The horn-honking is apparently by design, as the cars are programmed to tootle their horn trumpets melodiously if they detect another vehicle backing up into them. Thats understandable; weve tootled ourselves under these conditions, with vigor, even. But when the parking lot is full of cars that (presumably) cant hear the honking and (also presumably) know where the other driverless vehicles are as well as their intent, whats the point? Luckily, Waymo is on the case, as they issued a fix to keep the peace. Unfortunately, it sounds like the fix is just to geofence the lot and inhibit honking there, which seems like just a band-aid to us.\n\nFrom the Tech Doesnt Make Everything Better department, weve got news of a vulnerability in high-end racing bicycles that opens up a new vector for cheating. While our bike has been sitting sadly idle for the last twenty-odd years, apparently shifting technology has changed a lot, to the point where high-end derailleurs are no longer connected to handlebar-mounted shift lever by Bowden cables but now have servos that are linked to the shifters via Bluetooth. Anyone with more than a few minutes of experience with Bluetooth accessories and their default 123456 passwords can see where this is going. While there are no specific instances of cheating detailed in the story, one can imagine the hilarity to be had with a Flipper Zero while sitting on the side of a road at a course upgrade. To be sure, there are other ways to cheat, but were not sure we see the advantages of wireless shifting that offset the risks in this case.\nOnly 94 percent? A recent study claims to have quantified business spreadsheet errors, finding that 94% have critical problems. They came to this conclusion by mining literature from journal articles dating back to 1987, but rather than looking for papers with associated spreadsheets and analyzing them for errors, they looked for papers that discussed spreadsheet quality assurance. So this is sort of a meta-study, which makes us doubt the 94% finding. Still, wed say its a safe bet that there are a lot of spreadsheets out there with critical errors, and that spreadsheet abuse is pretty rampant overall.\nThey say that if youre not looking for your next job, youre just waiting to get fired. Thats pretty much a tautology since there are only two  OK, three  ways out of any job, but its still good to always be looking for your next opportunity. So you might want to check out eejobboard, which allows you to do a parametric job search in the electrical engineering space. Pretty cool stuff.\nAnd finally, we dont have any information on this other than what you see in the video, but wed love to learn more about these hardware FFTs. The video shows two implementations, one using a Zync 7020 FPGA, and one that uses over a thousand 74HC-series chips to do the same thing. If anyone out there knows the OP on this one, wed love to get in touch.\n", "title": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u7121\u4eba\u8eca\u304c\u591c\u4e2d\u306b\u30af\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u9cf4\u3089\u3057\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u7406\u7531", "body": "\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u904b\u8ee2\u8eca\u304c\u672a\u660e\u306b\u30af\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u9cf4\u3089\u3057\u3001\u8fd1\u96a3\u4f4f\u6c11\u304c\u4e0d\u6e80\u3092\u8ff0\u3079\u305f\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9\u7528\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u306b\u306f\u4e0d\u6b63\u884c\u70ba\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u624b\u53e3\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u304c94%\u306f\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u306a\u554f\u984c\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7814\u7a76\u7d50\u679c\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002eejobboard\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u306e\u6c42\u4eba\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3060\u3002 FFT\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3082\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30e2\u306e\u7121\u4eba\u8eca\u304c\u591c\u4e2d\u306b\u30af\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u9cf4\u3089\u3057\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u7406\u7531", "\u9ad8\u7d1a\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u306b\u6f5c\u3080\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "\u6700\u65b0\u306e\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u8aa4\u308a\u7387\u304c94%\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8abf\u67fb\u7d50\u679c", "\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u5b66\u306e\u6c42\u4eba\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u63a2\u305b\u308beejobboard", "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2FFT\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u5b9f\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5"]}

The aircraft was a total loss, but thankfully, the pilot suffered only minor injuries. According to the recently released report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, we now know a failed 3D printed part is to blame.\nThe part in question is a plastic air induction elbow  a curved duct that forms part of the engines air intake system. The collapsed part you see in the image above had an air filter attached to its front (towards the left in the image), which had detached and fallen off. Heat from the engine caused the part to soften and collapse, which in turn greatly reduced intake airflow, and therefore available power.\nSerious injury was avoided, but the aircraft was destroyed.\nWhile the cause of the incident is evident enough, there are still some unknowns regarding the part itself. The fact that it was 3D printed isnt an issue. Additive manufacturing is used effectively in the aviation industry all the time, and it seems the owner of the aircraft purchased the part at an airshow in the USA with no reason to believe anything was awry. So what happened?\nThe part in question is normally made from laminated fiberglass and epoxy, with a glass transition of 84\u00b0 C. Glass transition is the temperature at which a material begins to soften, and is usually far below the materials actual melting point.\nWhen a part is heated at or beyond its glass transition, it doesnt melt but is no longer solid in the normal sense, and may not even be able to support its own weight. Its the reason some folks pack parts in powdered salt to support them before annealing.\nThe printed part the owner purchased and installed was understood to be made from CF-ABS, or ABS with carbon fiber. ABS has a glass transition of around 100\u00b0 C, which should have been plenty for this application. However, the investigation tested two samples taken from the failed part and measured the glass temperature at 52.8\u00b0C and 54.0\u00b0C, respectively. Thats a far cry from what was expected, and led to part failure from the heat of the engine.\nThe actual composition of the part in question has not been confirmed, but it sure seems likely that whatever it was made from, it wasnt ABS. The Light Aircraft Association (LAA) plans to circulate an alert to inspectors regarding 3D printed parts, and the possibility they arent made from what they claim to be."}

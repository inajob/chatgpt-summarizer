If you havent, dont feel bad. This relatively obscure language dates back to 1972 with the goal of being difficult to read and write. It is the intellectual parent of systems like brainf**k and other bad languages. Now, you can read the INTERCAL-72 source code thanks to a found printout. It will help if you can read SPITBOL, another obscure language that is a compiled version of SNOBOL (which is like an old-fashioned non-Unix awk program).\nHow strange it INTERCAL? Well, one of the statements is PLEASE. If you dont use it enough, youll offend the interpreter, who will then ignore your program. But if you use it too much, then you are a suck up and, therefore, your program will be ignored again. If you think GOTO is a bad idea, youll just hate COME FROM, although that was from a later version of INTERCAL.\n\nHeres the example program from the users manual:\n\n\n1 DO (5) NEXT\n2 (5) DO FORGET #1\n3 PLEASE WRITE IN :1\n4 DO .1 - \u2019V-:1~\u2019#32768c/#0\u2019c/#1\u2019~#3\n5 DO (1) NEXT\n6 DO :1 - \u2019V-:1~\u2019#65535c/#0\u2019c/#65535\u2019\n7 ~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019c/\u2019V-:1~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019\nc\n8 /#65535\u2019~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019\n9 DO :2 - #1\n10 PLEASE DO (4) NEXT\n11 (4) DO FORGET #1\n12 DO .1 - V-\u2019:1~:2\u2019c/#1~#3\n13 DO :1 - \u2019V-:1~\u2019#65535c/#0\u2019c/:2~\u2019#65535\n1\nc\n14 /#0\u2019\u2019~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019c/\u2019V-:1~\u2019#0\nc\n15 /#65535\u2019c/:2~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019\u2019~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019\n16 DO (1) NEXT\n17 DO :2 - :2~\u2019#0c/#65535\u2019\nc\n18 /\u2019:2~\u2019#65535c/#0\u2019c/#0\u2019~\u2019#32767c/#1\u2019\n19 DO (4) NEXT\n20 (2) DO RESUME .1\n21 (1) PLEASE DO (2) NEXT\n22 PLEASE FORGET #1\n23 DO READ OUT :1\n24 PLEASE DO .1 - \u2019V-\u2019:1~:1\u2019~#1c/#1\u2019~#3\n25 DO (3) NEXT\n26 PLEASE DO (5) NEXT\n27 (3) DO (2) NEXT\n28 PLEASE GIVE UP\n\n\nInterestingly, you can get SPITBOL for modern systems, so it is entirely possible to run this version of INTERCAL on a modern machine. Why? Thats for you to answer.\nThe heart of it all is on GitHub. Youll also find links to the manual should you attempt to use it. Weve looked at INTERCAL and other similar languages before.

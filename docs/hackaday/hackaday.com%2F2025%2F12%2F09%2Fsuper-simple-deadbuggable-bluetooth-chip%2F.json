What about ten pins, with 1.27 mm pitch? [deqing] from Hackaday.io shows us a chip from WCH, CH571K, in whats essentially a SO-10 package (ESSOP10). This chip has a RISC-V core, requires only three components to run, and can work Bluetooth through a simple wire antenna.\nThis chip is a RISC-V MCU with a Bluetooth peripheral built in, and comes from the CH57x family of WCH chips that resemble the nRF series were all used to. You get a fair few peripherals: UART, SPI, and ADC, and of course, Bluetooth 4 with Low Energy support to communicate with a smart device of your choice. For extra hacker cred, [deqing] deadbugs it, gluing all components and a 2.54 mm header for FTDI comms onto the chip, and shows us a demo using webBluetooth to toggle an LED through a button in the browser.\nYou need not be afraid of SDKs with this one. Theres Arduino IDE support (currently done through a fork of arduino_core_ch32) and a fair few external tools, including at least two programming tools, one official and one third-party. The chip is under a dollar on LCSC, even less if you buy multiple, so its worth throwing a few into your shopping cart. What could you do with it once received? Well, you could retrofit your smoke alarms with Bluetooth, create your own tire pressure monitors, or just build a smartphone-connected business card!", "title": "\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067Bluetooth\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff0110\u30d4\u30f3\u306eRISC-V MCU\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "\u5c0f\u578bBluetooth\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u300cCH571K\u300d\u306f\u3001RISC-V\u30b3\u30a2\u642d\u8f09\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5b89\u4fa1\u3067\u591a\u7528\u9014\u3002", "titles": ["\u7701\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u3067Bluetooth\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\uff0110\u30d4\u30f3\u306eRISC-V MCU\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "Bluetooth\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306eCH571K\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2", "Arduino IDE\u3067\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff01\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u308bBluetooth MCUs", "DIY\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\uff01\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u9023\u52d5\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3084\u7159\u63a2\u77e5\u6a5f", "\u5b89\u4fa1\u306aBluetooth\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u4e16\u754c"]}

Hes already done a regenerative receiver, but now hes starting on a tube transmitter that runs on batteries. Hes settled on a popular design for the time, a Jones push-pull transmitter. Despite the tubes, it will only put out a few watts, which is probably good for the batteries which, at the time, wouldnt have been like modern batteries. You can see the kickoff video below.\nAccording to the video, these kinds of radios were popular with expeditions to exotic parts of the world. He takes a nostalgic look back at some of the radios and antennas used in some of those expeditions.\n\nThe Jones oscillator originates with [Frank Jones, W6AJF] and was quite popular in the day, as he was well-known in ham radio circles then. Normally, these took a dual triode and a crystal along with some passive components. In this case, though, the transmitter will use two type 30 tubes. If you missed the series on the receiver, thatll give you something to watch while you wait for the next installment on the transmitter.\nWe are excited to see  and maybe hear  this station on the air. Of course, you can build simple gear today, too. You can only wonder what [Frank Jones] would think of modern software-defined radios.\n", "title": "\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u59cb\u52d5\uff01", "body": "1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u7121\u7dda\u5c40\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046[Mikrowave1]\u3002\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba\u5f0f\u30d7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d7\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u6570\u30ef\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u304b\u51fa\u529b\u3057\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002\u305d\u306e\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u63a2\u691c\u968a\u3067\u3082\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u53e4\u3044\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3067\u3001[Frank Jones]\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["\u30dd\u30fc\u30bf\u30d6\u30eb\u306a1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u98a8\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u5c40\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u59cb\u52d5\uff01", "\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u99c6\u52d5\u306e\u771f\u7a7a\u7ba1\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9", "\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30d7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d7\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4eba\u6c17\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u611b\u597d\u5bb6\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u306a\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u6307\u5357", "\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u30cf\u30e0\u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u30681930\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u6280\u8853\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03"]}

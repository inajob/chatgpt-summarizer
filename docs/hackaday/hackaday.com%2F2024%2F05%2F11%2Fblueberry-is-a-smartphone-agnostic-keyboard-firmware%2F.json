Well, cry no more, because [Joe LiTrenta] has made it possible for any modern smartphone whatsoever to have a detachable, physical keyboard and mouse at the ready. [Joe] calls this creation the BlueBerry.\n The keyboard/mouse combo in question is a little BlackBerry Bluetooth number from ZitaoTech which is available on Tindie, ready to go in a 3D printed case. What [Joe] has done is to create a custom ZMK-based firmware that allows the keyboard be device-agnostic.\nIn order to easily mount the keyboard to the phone and make it detachable, [Joe] used adhesive-backed metal mounting plates on both the phone and the keyboard, and a mag-safe pop socket to connect the two. The firmware makes use of layers so everything is easily accessible.\nCheck out the demo video after the break, which shows the board connected to a Google Pixel 7. It makes the phone comically long, but having a physical keyboard again is serious business, so whos laughing now? Wed love to see a keyboard that attaches to the broad side of the phone, so someone get on that. Please?\nDo you have a PinePhone? Theres an extremely cute keyboard for that.\n\n", "title": "\u300eBlueBerry\u300f: \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u5916\u3057\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88c5\u7740\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "body": "\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u5916\u3057\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u305fJoe LiTrenta\u306eBlueBerry\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u8a18\u4e8b\u3092\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["\u300eBlueBerry\u300f: \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u5916\u3057\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88c5\u7740\u53ef\u80fd\u306b", "DIY: \u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u7528\u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5", "ZMK\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2: \u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6c4e\u7528\u6027\u3092\u5411\u4e0a", "\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u306b\u88c5\u7740\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306eDIY\u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9: \u78c1\u6c17\u5f0f\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6d3b\u7528", "Google Pixel 7\u7528\u306e\u30c7\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u516c\u958b: \u7269\u7406\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u88c5\u7740"]}

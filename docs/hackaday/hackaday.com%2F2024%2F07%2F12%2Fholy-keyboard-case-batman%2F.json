Well, [rain2] aka [AffectionateWin7178], thats who. Vengeance is the sixth keyboard theyve designed, and lets just say we wouldnt mind seeing the other five.\nThis is a takeoff of Zazu, a custom case printed for the monoblock split designed by [AlSaMoMo]. A friend of [rain2] made a ZMK PCB for the Zazu about a month ago, and they dreamed up the case design together. Among our first questions were of course, how do you type without those bat wings digging into your palms? But evidently, they are designed not to get in the way at all during use.\nWe particularly like the gold skirt around the edge which joins the two printed halves. It goes nicely with the bank vault elements like the dial around the trackball and the five-way switch that resembles a handle. And yeah, we wish the Batmobile was a mouse, too. While it seems that [rain2] hasnt released the STLs for the case, you can find the ZMK Zazu repo on GitHub. Happy designing! As always, let us know what you come up with.\nHeres another BAT keyboard you might be interested in.", "title": "\"BAT\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9Vengeance: \u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u878d\u5408\"", "body": "[rain2] aka [AffectionateWin7178]\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\"Vengeance\"\u306f\u3001\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3001Zazu\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5f7c\u3089\u306f\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u554f\u984c\u306a\u304f\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002BAT keyboard\u306e\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002", "titles": ["\"BAT\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9Vengeance: \u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u6a5f\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u878d\u5408\"", "\"Zazu\u3092\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9BAT\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\"", "\"\u91d1\u8272\u306e\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u969b\u7acb\u3064BAT\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\"", "\"Github\u306b\u3066ZMK Zazu\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u516c\u958b\u4e2d\"", "\"BAT\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u9032\u5316\""]}

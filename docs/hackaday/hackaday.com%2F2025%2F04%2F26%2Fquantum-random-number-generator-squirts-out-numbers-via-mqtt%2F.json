[Sean Boyce] whipped up a rig that serves up just that, tasty random bytes delivered fresh over MQTT.\n[Sean] tells us hes been designing various quantum TRNGs for nearly 15 years as part of an elaborate practical joke without further explanation. We wont query as to why, and just examine the project itself. The main source of randomness  entropy, if you will  is a pair of transistors hooked up to create a bunch of avalanche noise that is apparently truly random, much like the zener diode method.\nIn any case, the noise from the transistors is then passed through a bunch of hex inverters and other supporting parts to shape the noise into a nicely random square wave. This is sampled by an ATtiny261A acting as a Von Neumann extractor, which converts the wave into individual bits of lovely random entropy. These are read by a Pi Pico W, which then assembles random bytes and pushes them out over MQTT.\nDid that sound like a lot? If youre not in the habit of building random number generators, it probably did. Nevertheless, weve heard from [Sean] on this topic before. Feel free to share your theories on the best random number generator designs below, or send your best builds straight to the tipsline. Randomly, of course!"}

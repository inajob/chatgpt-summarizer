This wasnt always such common knowledge, as for a time in the 19th century a chemical variously known as Paris or Emerald Green, but known to chemists as copper(II) acetoarsenite was a very popular green pigment. While this pigment is obviously not deadly on-contact, given that its taken 200 years to raise the alarm about these books (and it used to be used in candy (!)), arsenic is really not something you want in your system. Libraries around the world have been quarantining vintage green books \u0336f\u0336o\u0336r\u0336 \u0336f\u0336e\u0336a\u0336r\u0336 \u0336b\u0336i\u0336b\u0336l\u0336i\u0336o\u0336p\u0336h\u0336i\u0336l\u0336i\u0336es \u0336m\u0336i\u0336g\u0336h\u0336t\u0336 \u0336b\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336e\u0336m\u0336p\u0336t\u0336e\u0336d\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336l\u0336i\u0336c\u0336k\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336m\u0336\u00a0 out of an abundance of caution, but researchers at The University of St. Andrews have found a cheaper method to detect the poison pigment than XRF or Raman Spectroscopy previously employed.\nThe hack is simple, and in retrospect, rather obvious: using a a hand-held vis-IR spectrometer normally used by geologists for mineral ID, they analyzed the spectrum of the compound on book covers. (As an aside, Emerald Green is similar in both arsenic content and color to the mineral conichalcite, which you also should not lick.)\u00a0 The striking green colour obviously has a strong response in the green range of the spectrum, but other green pigments can as well. A second band in the near-infrared clinches the identification.\nA custom solution was then developed, which sadly does not seem to have been documented as of yet. From the press release it sounds like they are using LEDs and photodetectors for color detection in the green and IR at least, but there might be more to it, like a hacked version of common colour sensors that put filters on the photodetectors.\nWhile toxic books will still remain under lock and key, the hope is that with quick and easy identification tens of thousands of currently-quarantined texts that use safer green pigments can be returned to circulation.\nTip of the hat to [Jamie] for the tip off, via the BBC."}

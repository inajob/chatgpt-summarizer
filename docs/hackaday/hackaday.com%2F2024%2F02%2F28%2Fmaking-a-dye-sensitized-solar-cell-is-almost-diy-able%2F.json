We see very few projects where people actually create their own solar panels. And yet, thats precisely what [Shih Wei Chieh] has done!\nThe project consists of a large dye-sensitized solar panel. These are a type of solar panel that can easily be created by the DIY builder, though their efficiency leaves something to be desired versus the best commercial types available. However, you can build them in any way you like to suit your application, which can have some potential benefits.\nIt consists of two pieces of FTO glass that is etched and prepared to become the electrodes for a string of solar cells. The cells have to be treated with titanium dioxide and then laced with silver traces, before being assembled with liquid electrolyte squirted in between. Its finicky stuff, but the video almost makes it look easy if youre familiar with working in a chemistry lab, that is.\nWhile its DIY-able, its at the outer edge of what some of us would be comfortable with. It does involve some steps with semi-obscure chemicals and the use of a kiln to produce the cells. The design shown here outputs around 5.8 volts and 51 milliamps. Its not heaps, but its enough to run a low-power project for some time in an area with decent sun.\nWeve seen some other great solar projects over the years, too! Video after the break.\n\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u592a\u967d\u96fb\u6c60\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "body": "DIY\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3002FTO\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u4e8c\u9178\u5316\u30c1\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u51e6\u7406\u3057\u3066\u592a\u967d\u96fb\u6c60\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3002DIY\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u5316\u5b66\u85ac\u54c1\u3068\u7aaf\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u51fa\u529b\u306f5.8V\u300151mA\u3067\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u5411\u3051\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u592a\u967d\u96fb\u6c60\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "DIY\u592a\u967d\u96fb\u6c60\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u52d5\u753b", "\u5927\u578b\u306e\u67d3\u6599\u654f\u5316\u578b\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u306e\u4f5c\u6210", "FTO\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u81ea\u4f5c\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb", "DIY\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u5b9f\u9a13\u7684\u88fd\u4f5c"]}

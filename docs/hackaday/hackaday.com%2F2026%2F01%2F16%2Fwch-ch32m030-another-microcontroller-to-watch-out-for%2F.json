With Chinese parts theres always a period in which Chinese manufacturers and nobody else has them, and then they quietly appear on AliExpress.\nAll of which brings us to the WCH CH32M030, a chip thats been on the radar for a while and has finally broken cover. Its the CH32 RISC-V microcontroller you may be familiar with, but with a set of four half-bridge drivers on board for running motors. A handy, cheap, and very smart motor controller, if you will.\nTheres been at\u00a0 least one Chinese CH32M030 dev board (Chinese language) online for a while now, but the one listed on AliExpress appears to be a different design. At the time of writing the most popular one is still showing fewer than 20 sales, so were getting in at the ground floor here.\nWe think this chip is of interest because it has the potential to be used in low price robotic projects, replacing as it does a couple of parts or modules in one go. If you use it, wed like to hear from you!", "title": "- WCH CH32M030\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044RISC-V\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u767b\u5834", "body": "\u65b0\u3057\u3044WCH CH32M030\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306f\u3001\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5236\u5fa1\u306b\u4fbf\u5229\u3067\u5b89\u4fa1\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u6700\u9069\u3067\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["- WCH CH32M030\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044RISC-V\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306e\u767b\u5834", "- \u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u5185\u8535\u306eCH32M030\u3067\u30ed\u30dc\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u52a0\u901f", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u5411\u3051\uff01\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eCH32M030\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb", "- CH32M030\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30eb\u7d71\u5408\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u524a\u6e1b", "- AliExpress\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\uff1aCH32M030\u958b\u767a\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027"]}

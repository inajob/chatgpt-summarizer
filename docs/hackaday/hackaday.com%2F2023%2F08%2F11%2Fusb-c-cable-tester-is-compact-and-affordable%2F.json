With the increased conductor count and complexity of USB Type C, there are many more ways your cable can disappoint you. Over in Austria, [Peter Traunm\u00fcller] aka [petl] has designed the C2C caberQU USB C cable tester. This small PCB tester checks every wire on the cable, including the shield, and both connector orientations. He also makes a version for testing USB A to C cables (see video below the break).\nAutomatic cable testers are often associated with factory production, where you want to test a large quantity of cables quickly and automatically, and are priced accordingly. But this project makes it affordable and easy for anyone to test single cables in a home lab or small office.\nThe tester only checks for basic continuity, but that should solve a majority of USB-C cable problems. All the documentation for this tester is available on the projects GitHub repository, including Gerbers, schematics, and mechanical details. Or if youd rather buy one pre-made, [petl] has put them up for sale on Tindie.\n"}

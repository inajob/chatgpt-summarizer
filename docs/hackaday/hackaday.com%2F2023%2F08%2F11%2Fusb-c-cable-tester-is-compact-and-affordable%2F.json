With the increased conductor count and complexity of USB Type C, there are many more ways your cable can disappoint you. Over in Austria, [Peter Traunm\u00fcller] aka [petl] has designed the C2C caberQU USB C cable tester. This small PCB tester checks every wire on the cable, including the shield, and both connector orientations. He also makes a version for testing USB A to C cables (see video below the break).\nAutomatic cable testers are often associated with factory production, where you want to test a large quantity of cables quickly and automatically, and are priced accordingly. But this project makes it affordable and easy for anyone to test single cables in a home lab or small office.\nThe tester only checks for basic continuity, but that should solve a majority of USB-C cable problems. All the documentation for this tester is available on the projects GitHub repository, including Gerbers, schematics, and mechanical details. Or if youd rather buy one pre-made, [petl] has put them up for sale on Tindie.\n", "title": "\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUSB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "body": "C2C caberQU\u306f\u3001USB-C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u914d\u7dda\u3001\u30b7\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u3001\u30b3\u30cd\u30af\u30bf\u306e\u5411\u304d\u306a\u3069\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u751f\u7523\u73fe\u5834\u5411\u3051\u306e\u81ea\u52d5\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u81ea\u5b85\u3084\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u3067\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u9023\u7d9a\u6027\u306e\u307f\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002GitHub\u30ea\u30dd\u30b8\u30c8\u30ea\u3067\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "titles": ["\u81ea\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u306aUSB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb", "USB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u4fe1\u983c\u6027\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb", "\u81ea\u5b85\u3084\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b9\u3067\u3082\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u306eUSB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "USB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u9023\u7d9a\u6027\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc", "USB C\u30b1\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e\u88fd\u4f5c\u54c1\u3082\u8cfc\u5165\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3001\u4fbf\u5229\u306a\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc"]}

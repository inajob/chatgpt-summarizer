Luckily, [Max Woolf] created simpleaichat, which is complete with examples and documentation and minimal code complexity.\nAs [Max] puts it, the main motivations behind the project are to provide useful tools while making it easier for non-engineers to peer through the breathless hyperbole and see just how AI-based apps actually work. This project was directly inspired by [Max]s own real-world software experiences in this area, particularly his frustrations with popular and much-hyped frameworks in which Hello World feels a lot more like Hell World.\nsimpleaichat is a Python package that provides easy and powerful ways to interface with the OpenAI API, makers of ChatGPT. Now, it is true that OpenAIs models are not open source and access is not free, but they are easily one of the most capable and cost-effective services of their kind.\nPrefer something a little more open, and a lot more private? Theres always the option to run an LLM locally on your own machine, possibly with the help of a tool like text-generation-webui or gpt4all. Running an LLM locally will not have the quality of OpenAIs offerings, but it can still do the job. Its also possible to give these local LLMs an interface that mimics OpenAIs API, so there are loads of possibilities.\nAre you getting ideas yet? Share them in the comments, or keep them to yourselves and submit a tip once your project is off the ground!"}

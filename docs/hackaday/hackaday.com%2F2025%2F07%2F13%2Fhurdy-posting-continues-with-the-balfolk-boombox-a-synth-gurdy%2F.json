How else could you explain a medieval wheel fiddle being turned into a synthesizer? Move over, keytar  [Rory Scammell]s Balfolk Boombox is the real deal.\nIt began life as MIDI-outputting SAMgurdy by [Sam Palmer], which we sadly missed covering (though we did feature a MIDI-gurdy a few years back) but this boombox does far more than just MIDI samples. In a sentence no one ever thought would be penned, this instrument puts a Eurorack on a Hurdy-Gurdy for the ultimate synthwave bardcore mashup. Theres an analog synth, theres a drum machine, theres modularity to do whatever [Rory] should desire. There are also sixteen sampled instruments available at the push of a button, including multiple analog Hurdy-Gurdies.\nIt is, as [Rory] says, a gig in a box. Theres no point trying to describe it all in words: it really must be heard to be believed, so check out the demo video embedded below, and if youre hankering for more info, he produced a fifteen minute in-depth video and if you cant get enough of the sound, heres a demo with all 16 sampled instruments. Were pretty sure one of them is the Sega soundfont, and the 8-bit samples are absolutely GameBoy.\nHow, exactly, we fell in love with the hurdy-gurdy has fallen into mystery, but weve been filling up the hurdy-gurdy tag lately, on your suggestions. This one is thanks to a tip from [Physics Dude] in a comment thanks for that, by the way and the tips line remains open if the internet has not finally been scoured of all content both hurdy and gurdy.\u00a0\n\n"}

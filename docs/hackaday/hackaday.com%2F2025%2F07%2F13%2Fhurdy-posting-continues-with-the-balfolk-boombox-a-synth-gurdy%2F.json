How else could you explain a medieval wheel fiddle being turned into a synthesizer? Move over, keytar  [Rory Scammell]s Balfolk Boombox is the real deal.\nIt began life as MIDI-outputting SAMgurdy by [Sam Palmer], which we sadly missed covering (though we did feature a MIDI-gurdy a few years back) but this boombox does far more than just MIDI samples. In a sentence no one ever thought would be penned, this instrument puts a Eurorack on a Hurdy-Gurdy for the ultimate synthwave bardcore mashup. Theres an analog synth, theres a drum machine, theres modularity to do whatever [Rory] should desire. There are also sixteen sampled instruments available at the push of a button, including multiple analog Hurdy-Gurdies.\nIt is, as [Rory] says, a gig in a box. Theres no point trying to describe it all in words: it really must be heard to be believed, so check out the demo video embedded below, and if youre hankering for more info, he produced a fifteen minute in-depth video and if you cant get enough of the sound, heres a demo with all 16 sampled instruments. Were pretty sure one of them is the Sega soundfont, and the 8-bit samples are absolutely GameBoy.\nHow, exactly, we fell in love with the hurdy-gurdy has fallen into mystery, but weve been filling up the hurdy-gurdy tag lately, on your suggestions. This one is thanks to a tip from [Physics Dude] in a comment thanks for that, by the way and the tips line remains open if the internet has not finally been scoured of all content both hurdy and gurdy.\u00a0\n\n", "title": "- \u4e2d\u4e16\u697d\u5668\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u304c\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u9032\u5316", "body": "\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u304c\u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u697d\u5668\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3002MIDI\u51fa\u529b\u306eSAMgurdy\u3092\u57fa\u306b\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u6a5f\u80fd\u3092\u642d\u8f09\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e2d\u4e16\u697d\u5668\u306e\u9769\u65b0\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u304c\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u306b\u9032\u5316", "- MIDI\u304b\u3089\u30e2\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u3078\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "- \u30d0\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30a2\u3068\u30b7\u30f3\u30bb\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u306e\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 16\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u97f3\u6e90\u3092\u642d\u8f09\uff01\u97f3\u697d\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u300c\u30ae\u30b0\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300d", "- \u30c7\u30e2\u52d5\u753b\u5fc5\u898b\uff01\u30cf\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u4f53\u9a13\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}

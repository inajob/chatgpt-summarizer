Humans werent content to let the fluffy, friend-shaped creatures stay in their natural habitat, however, and they can now be found on every continent except Antarctica. The Llama2 Large Language Model is like that: while it may have started on a GPU somewhere, thanks to enterprising hackers like [Caio Madeira], who has ported Llama2 to the PlayStation Portable (PSP), the fluffiest LLM can be found just about anywhere.\nThe AI, in all its glory, dooming yet another system.\nUltimately this project has its roots in Llama2.c by [karpathy], a project weve seen used on Pentium II under Windows 98, DOS machines running 486 processors, and even the venerable Commodore 64, of all impossible things. Now, its the PSPs turn. This implementation uses the same 260K tinystories model as the C64 port, upon which it is based. Of course the PSPs RAM has room for a much larger model, but [Ciao] apparently prefers to run the tiny model faster on this less-ancient gaming hardware.\nIts getting to the point that its harder to find systems that wont run LLMs than those that do. Given that Llama2 seems to be the new DOOM, its probably only a matter of time before their virtual fur is all over all our old equipment. Fortunately for allergy sufferers, virtual fur cannot trigger a histamine response.\nIf you know of another system getting LLMs (Alpaca-adjacent or otherwise), send in a tip."}

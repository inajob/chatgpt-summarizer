In case you missed it, KiCad 9 moved up into the pro league, and finally, were hiring, so come join us in the dungeon.\nOn Whats That Sound, Kristina didnt get close at all, but at least had a guess this time. Thats okay, though, because nobody got it right! Were still giving a t-shirt away to [Dakota], though, probably because Elliot has a thing for using random number generators.\nThen its on to the hacks and such beginning with a beautiful handheld compass CNC and cyanotype prints made with resin printers UV light. After that, we take a look at open-source random numbers, a 3D-printed instant camera, and a couple of really cool cyberdecks. Finally, we discuss whether DOOM is doomed as the port of choice in this day and age, and kvetch about keyboards.\nCheck out the links below if you want to follow along, and as always, tell us what you think about this episode in\u00a0the comments!\n\nDownload in DRM-free MP3 and savor at your leisure.\nWhere to Follow Hackaday PodcastPlaces to follow Hackaday podcasts:\n\n\n\tiTunes\n\tSpotify\n\tStitcher\n\tRSS\n\t\tYouTube\n\tCheck\n\t\tout our Libsyn landing page\n\n\nEpisode 310 Show Notes:\nNews:\n\nHackaday Europe 2025: Workshops And More Speakers\nKiCad 9 Moves Up In The Pro League\nWe\u2019re Hiring: Come Join Us!\n\nWhats that Sound?\n\nCongrats to [Dakota] who drew lucky number 13 and a Hackaday Podcast t-shirt!\n\nInteresting Hacks of the Week:\n\nHandheld Compass CNC Lets Teensy Do The Driving\n\nHands-On The Shaper Origin: A Tool That Changes How We Build\n\n\nCyanotype Prints On A Resin 3D Printer\n\nUsing A Potato As Photographic Recording Surface\n\n\nOpen-Source Random Numbers\n3D Print An Instant Camera\nHarvesting Water With High Voltage\nA Precisely Elegant Cyberdeck Handheld\n\nQuick Hacks:\n\nElliots Picks:\n\nPico Gets A Speed Bump\nA Web-Based Graphics Editor For Tiny Screens\nTo Test A (Smart) LED\nImport GPU: Python Programming With CUDA\nSHOUT For Smaller QR Codes\n\n\nKristinas Picks:\n\n3D Print Yourself A Split Flap Display\nThe Perfect Pi Pico Portable Computer\nInfill Injection Experiment Makes Stronger Parts\n\n\n\nCant-Miss Articles:\n\nWhat Game Should Replace Doom As The Meme Port Of Choice?\nKeebin\u2019 With Kristina: The One With All The Green Keyboards\n", "title": "- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d12025\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u8b1b\u6f14\u8005\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b", "body": "Hackaday\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3067\u6700\u65b0\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3084\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u7d39\u4ecb\u3055\u308c\u30012025\u5e74\u306e\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3084KiCad 9\u306e\u9032\u5c55\u3082\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30cf\u30c3\u30ab\u30c7\u30a4\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d12025\uff1a\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u3068\u8b1b\u6f14\u8005\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b", "- KiCad 9\u304c\u30d7\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0\u3078\u9032\u51fa\uff01\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6642\u4ee3", "- \u3053\u306e\u9031\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30cf\u30c3\u30af\uff1a\u643a\u5e2f\u578b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9CNC\u3068UV\u6a39\u8102\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8", "- \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u4e71\u6570\u751f\u6210\u30683D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9", "- DOOM\u306e\u672a\u6765\uff1a\u4eca\u6642\u306e\u30e1\u30fc\u30e0\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u4f55\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f"]}

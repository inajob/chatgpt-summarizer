Its an Advance E1 from around 1950, and it was particularly interesting from here because it matches the model on the shelf above this bench. Shes back with a new video on the E1, allowing us a further look inside it as she replaces a dead capacitor, gets its audio oscillator working, and upgrades its sockets.\nTreating us to a further peek inside the unit, first up is a leaky capacitor. Then a knotty question for old tech enthusiasts, to upgrade or not? The ancient co-ax connectors are out of place on a modern bench, so does originality matter enough to give it a set of BNC sockets? Wed tend to agree; just because we have some adapters for the unit here doesnt mean its convenient. Following on from that is a period variable frequency audio mod which has failed, so out that comes and a little fault-finding is required to get the wiring of the audio transformer.\nThese instruments are not by any means compact, but they do have the advantage of being exceptionally well-built and above all cheap. We hope readers appreciate videos like the one below the break, and that youre encouraged not to be scared of diving in to older items like this one to fix them. Meanwhile the first installment is here.\n\n", "title": "- \u53e4\u3044\u4fe1\u53f7\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a1950\u5e74\u88fd\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9E1\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "body": "Jazzy Jane\u304c1950\u5e74\u88fd\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7\u767a\u751f\u5668E1\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3002\u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002", "titles": ["- \u53e4\u3044\u4fe1\u53f7\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\uff1a1950\u5e74\u88fd\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9E1\u306e\u4fee\u7406", "- \u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\uff1a\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30d1\u30b7\u30bf\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9", "- \u53e4\u3044\u6280\u8853\u3092\u611b\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u3078\uff1aE1\u306e\u30bd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u9078\u629e", "- \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff1a\u5931\u6557\u3057\u305f\u5909\u8abf\u56de\u8def\u306e\u5b9f\u4f8b", "- \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u6a5f\u5668\u3092\u4fee\u7406\u3059\u308b\u52c7\u6c17\u3092\uff1a\u53e4\u3044\u4fe1\u53f7\u767a\u751f\u5668\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u5229\u70b9"]}

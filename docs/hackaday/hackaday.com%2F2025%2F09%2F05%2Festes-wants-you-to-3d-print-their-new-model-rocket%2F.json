From the design and construction of the rockets themselves to the reliability and safety of the modular solid-propellant motors, the company managed to turn actual rocket science into a family activity. If you could glue fins onto a cardboard tube and stick a plastic nosecone on the end, you were nearly ready for launch.\nBut what if youre looking for something a bit more challenging? Thats where the new Estes Scorpio 3D comes in. Unlike the classic Estes kit, which included the fins, nosecone, and other miscellaneous bits of the rocket, the Scorpio kit requires you to 3D print your own parts. Do it right, and the company says you can send your creation to heights of 1,000 feet (305 m).\n\nAs several main components of the rocket are 3D printed, the Scorpio is intended to be a platform for fast and easy modification. Estes already provides STLs for a few different variants of the tail fins  this is not unlike some of the old kits, which would occasionally include different shaped fins for you to experiment with. But of course youre also free to design your own components from scratch if you wish. A twist-lock mechanism built into the printed motor mount allows you to swap out the Scorpios fins in the field, no glue required.\nWhile we appreciate the concept of the Scorpio 3D, we have to admit that the $40 USD price tag seems a bit excessive. After all, the user is expected to print the majority of the rockets parts on their own dime. According to the manual, the only thing you get with the kit (other than access to the digital files) is a couple of cardboard tubes, some stickers, and a parachute  the launch pad, igniter, and even motors are all sold separately.\n\nAdmittedly theres a certain value in the Estes name and the knowledge that theyve done their homework while putting this product together. But if youre just looking to fire off some DIY rockets, wed point you to the open source HEXA project as an alternative.\n<!--more-->\n", "title": "- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Estes Scorpio 3D\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "body": "\u30a8\u30b9\u30c6\u30b9\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044Scorpio 3D\u306f\u30013D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3001\u6311\u6226\u7684\u306a\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4fa1\u683c\u306f\u9ad8\u3081\u3002", "titles": ["- \u81ea\u5206\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\uff01Estes Scorpio 3D\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u96fb\u5b50\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1aScorpio 3D\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8", "- Estes\u306eScorpio 3D\uff1aDIY\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u5236\u4f5c\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u6311\u6226", "- \u9ad8\u5ea61000\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u305b\uff01Scorpio 3D\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc", "- \u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\uff1fEstes Scorpio 3D\u30ad\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u5b9f\u969b"]}

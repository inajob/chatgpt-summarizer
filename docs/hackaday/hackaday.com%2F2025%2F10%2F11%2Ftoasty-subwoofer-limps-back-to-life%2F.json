That led to the discovery of a blown fuse and a corresponding repair. When he opened it up, he could smell that something had gone on in the amplifier. You can follow the repair in the video below.\nHis first theory was that some glue became conductive and shorted the power rails. We were skeptical, to be honest. When he fed power to it through a current limiter, he could hear a sizzling noise and even see a little glowing from the hot component.\nDisassembly ensued. Removing the suspect components showed some seriously burned components and some charring under a switching transistor. The capacitors looked much worse for wear, and the PCB needed some wires to jumper burned conductors.\nAt the end, there was thumping, so it seems the surgery was a success. However, testing blew a fuse again, which made us nervous. Still, seems to work if you dont drive it too hard.\nWe always enjoy watching a teardown, and if theres a repair too, thats even better.\n\n", "title": "\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u52a3\u5316\u3057\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u767a\u898b", "body": "\u89aa\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u304b\u3089\u4f4e\u97f3\u304c\u805e\u3053\u3048\u305a\u3001\u4fee\u7406\u3092\u8a66\u307f\u305f\u3002\u7126\u3052\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u304c\u78ba\u8a8d\u3055\u308c\u3001\u518d\u751f\u6210\u529f\u3082 Fuse \u304c\u518d\u3073\u98db\u3076\u3002", "titles": ["\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u306e\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u4fee\u7406\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff01\u52a3\u5316\u3057\u305f\u90e8\u54c1\u3092\u767a\u898b", "\u77ed\u7d61\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u3092\u8ffd\u6c42\uff01\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u5206\u89e3\u4f5c\u696d", "\u7089\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u71b1\uff01\u640d\u50b7\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u78ba\u8a8d", "\u4fee\u7406\u6210\u529f\uff1f\u518d\u3073\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u98db\u3093\u3060\u8b0e\u3068\u306f", "\u30c6\u30a2\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u306e\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080"]}

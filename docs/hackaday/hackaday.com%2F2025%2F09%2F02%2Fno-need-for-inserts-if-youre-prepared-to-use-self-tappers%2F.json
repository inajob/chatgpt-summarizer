One of them is the threaded insert, a a piece of machined brass designed to be heat-set into a printed hole in the part. They can be placed by hand with a soldering iron, or for the really cool kids, with a purpose-built press. They look great and they can certainly make assembly of a 3D printed structure very easy, but Im here to tell you they are not as necessary as they might seem. Theres an alternative I have been using for years which does essentially the same job without the drama.\nEnter The Self-Tapper\nThis turret camera project features both inserts on the M12 lens holders, and self-tappers for the centre boss and the mounting screws.\nWhen we think of screws or other fastenings, if were not a woodworker, the chances are that its a machine screw which comes to mind. A high-precision machined parallel thread, intended to screw into a similarly machined receptacle. Where this is being written theyre mostly metric, in fact I have a small pile of M3 bolts on my desk as I write this, for mounting a Raspberry Pi LCD screen. These are what you would use with those heat-set inserts, and they are generally a very good way to attach parts to each other.\nHowever good an M3 bolt is though, I dont use them for most of my 3D printing work. Instead, I use self-tapping screws. A self-tapper is a screw with a wide tapering pitch, designed to cut its own thread into a soft material. Most wood screws are self-tappers, as are many screws used for example with aluminium sheet. The material is soft enough for a reliable enough coupling to be made, even if repeated use or over-tightening can destroy it. Its easy to make 3D prints that can take self-tapping screws in this way, I find it reliable enough for my purposes, and I think it can save you a bunch of time with heat inserts.\nHow To Make It All Happen\nDesigning for a self-tapping connection in a 3D print is simplicity itself: a suitable hole for the screw thread to pass through is placed in the upper side, while the lower side has a smaller hole for the thread to bite into. The size of the smaller hole can vary significantly without penalty, but I normally make it the diameter of the shaft of the screw without the thread. A simple example for a 3mm self-tapper in OpenSCAD is shown below, along with a render of the result.\n//Screw head end\ntranslate([0,0,20]){  //Move upwards to see both parts\n    difference(){\n        cube([20,20,4]);\n        //screw thread\n        translate([10,10,0]) cylinder(10,1.5,1.5); \n        //screw head\n        translate([10,10,2]) cylinder(10,3,3);  \n    }\n}\n\n//Screw thread end\ndifference(){\n    cube([20,20,10]);\n    translate([10,10,0]) cylinder(10,1,1); // For the screw to bite into\n}\n\nAssembly follows construction in its simplicity; simply line up both holes and screw the self-tapping screw into them. It should be obvious when the screw is tight enough. Mashing upon it, just like with any other self tapper, risks stripping the thread.\nEveryone makes things in their own manner, and its likely that among you will be people who might decry the use of self-tappers in a 3D print. But I have found this technique to be a simple and cheap time saver for as many years as Ive been 3D printing. I hope by sharing it with you, Ive given you a useful tool in your work.", "title": "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30bf\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "body": "3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u30cd\u30b8\u7a74\u306b\u81ea\u5df1\u306d\u3058\u8fbc\u307f\u30cd\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u71b1\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u7c21\u6613\u3067\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u306a\u7d44\u307f\u7acb\u3066\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3002", "titles": ["- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u65b0\u6280\u8853\uff1a\u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30bf\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03", "- \u81ea\u4f5c\u306e3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u306e\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30bf\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u6cd5", "- \u624b\u8efd\u306b\u53d6\u308a\u5165\u308c\u3089\u308c\u308b3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u63a5\u7d9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30bf\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u5229\u70b9", "- \u30b9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u4ee3\u308f\u308b\uff01\u30bb\u30eb\u30d5\u30bf\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u306e\u9b45\u529b", "- 3D\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af"]}

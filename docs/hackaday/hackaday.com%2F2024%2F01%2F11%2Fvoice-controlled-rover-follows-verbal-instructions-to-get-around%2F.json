[Robotcus] decided to build a simple robot platform that drove around in response to voice commands instead.\nThe robot is based around a Raspberry Pi Zero, charged with instructing the motor controllers to drive the bot around. The Pi Zero is also in charge of interpreting the voice commands via Googles speech recognition tool. The bot itself is a fairly simple design using brushed gearmotors for propulsion and a 3D-printed chassis to tie everything together.\nThe car is capable of understanding five commands  drive, turn left, turn right, go backwards, and attack. The last command simply activates a flipper from the robots former life as a battlebot. Things ran okay at first, but the Pi Zero was slow at processing commands. The wheels also had minimal traction. A full-fat Raspberry Pi solved the latter issue, while a new chassis provided better grip.\nIts a simple project, but one that taught [Robotcus] plenty about programming and building small robots in the process. Like so many learning experiences, its easy to see how the robot starts out flailing uselessly and eventually starts to perform as intended. Its always nice to see that progression.

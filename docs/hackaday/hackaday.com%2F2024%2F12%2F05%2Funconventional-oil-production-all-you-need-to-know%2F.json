For example we all think we know something about hydraulic fracking wells, but how much do we really know?\n[John Thurmond] is a geologist who has recently completed a long career in the oil industry, and he gave an informative talk on the matter at the summers EMF Camp in the UK. It makes for an interesting watch, as he leads the viewer through the process in detail, before discussing what should and shouldnt cause worry.\nWe learn that fracking has two parts: first the hydraulic fracking itself, and then the re-injection of the toxic fracking well water released from underground along with the oil or gas. It seems the water released from the rocks a 10,000 ft depth contains all manner of toxic and even radioactive compounds, and the usual means of disposal is to inject it back into the ground at a much lower depth. He makes the point that while the hazards associated with the fracking are low, those of the re-injection are high.\nThe talk finishes up with perhaps the most interesting point, by looking at the nature of opposition to fracking, or indeed any other controversial development. Such things are inevitably surrounded by a swirling mess of half-truths, and his point is that identifying those easily deflected as not true is key to understanding the whole thing. Its presented from an expert and factual perspective thats so often lacking in this arena, and thus we think its worth a watch.\n\n", "title": "- \u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "body": "\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5\u306e\u8ab2\u984c\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u6c34\u5727\u7834\u7815\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u5371\u967a\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14\u3002", "titles": ["- \u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u5b66\u3076", "- \u5730\u8cea\u5b66\u8005\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u771f\u5b9f", "- \u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30ed\u30ab\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u7523\u696d\u306e\u88cf\u5074\u306b\u8feb\u308b", "- \u6709\u6bd2\u5ec3\u6c34\u518d\u6ce8\u5165\u306e\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "- \u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u53cd\u5bfe\u610f\u898b\u306e\u771f\u76f8\u89e3\u660e"]}

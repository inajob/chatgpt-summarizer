According to [Project 326], you need a gamma ray spectrometer. The video below reviews the Radiacode 110. The channel has reviewed other Radiacode products, and they havent always been pleased with them, apparently. Is the 110 better?\nThe little spectrometer uses a scintillation crystal and performs a spectrogram on the result. It has a large library of materials so, at least for radioactive materials, you can point it at something and tell what kind of material you are dealing with and how radioactive it is.\nWhile the smartphone app seems well done, the Windows application left something to be desired. Even still, it was able to identify several isotopes. The device can even pick up some alpha emitters that dont directly register. However, it can identify some materials by different decomposition products. Unlike some earlier models, this device is supposed to be highly sensitive and high-resolution.\nTo confirm this, [Project 326] built a lead shielding structure and read a reference sample. Crunching some numbers confirmed that the claimed performance was accurate. It could even read very low-energy sources, though there were some limitations. The ergonomics of the device could be better, apparently, but it does deliver on performance.\nDo you need a gamma ray spectrometer? We dont know, but we suspect if you do, you dont need us to tell you.\n\n", "title": "- \u300c\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u8cea\u3092\u6271\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5fc5\u9808\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\uff1a\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "body": "\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u8cea\u7528\u306b\u3001\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u30ac\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u30ab\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3002Radiacode 110\u306f\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002", "titles": ["- \u300c\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u7269\u8cea\u3092\u6271\u3046\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5fc5\u9808\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\uff1a\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u300d", "- \u300cRadiacode 110\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff1a\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u300d", "- \u300c\u9ad8\u611f\u5ea6\u3067\u9ad8\u89e3\u50cf\u5ea6\u306a\u653e\u5c04\u7dda\u6e2c\u5b9a\u5668\u306e\u6027\u80fd\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u300d", "- \u300c\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3068Windows\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u6bd4\u8f03\uff1aRadiacode 110\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u52dd\u624b\u300d", "- \u300c\u4f4e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6e90\u3082\u691c\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\uff1f\u30ac\u30f3\u30de\u7dda\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3092\u691c\u8a3c\u300d"]}

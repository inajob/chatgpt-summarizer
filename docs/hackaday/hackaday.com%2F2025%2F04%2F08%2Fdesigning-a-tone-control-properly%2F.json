As time passed, this was split into two controls for bass and treble, and then finally into three for bass, mid, and treble. When audiophile fashion shifted towards graphic equalisers, these tone controls were rebranded as 3-band graphic equalisers, a misleading term if ever we heard one. [Gabriel Dantas]\u00a0designed one of these circuits, and unlike the simple passive networks found on cheap music centres of old, hes doing a proper job with active filters.\nThe write-up is worth a read even if you are not in the market for a fancy tone control, for the basic primer it gives on designing an audio filter. The design contains, as you might expect, a low-pass, a bandpass, and a high-pass filter. These are built around TL072 FET-input op-amps, and an LM386 output stage is added to drive headphones.\nThe final project is built on a home-made PCB, complete with mains power supply. Audiophiles might demand more exotic parts, but were guessing that even with these proletarian components it will still sound pretty good. Probably better than the headphone amplifier featured in a recent project from a Hackaday writer, at least. Theres a build video, below the break.\n\n\n", "title": "\u4e00\u6b69\u9032\u3093\u3060\u97f3\u8cea\u8abf\u6574\uff1a\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "body": "\u97f3\u97ff\u6a5f\u5668\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3001\u97f3\u8cea\u52b9\u679c\u3092\u6301\u3064\u56de\u8def\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3002\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u3082\u5b66\u3079\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "titles": ["\u4e00\u6b69\u9032\u3093\u3060\u97f3\u8cea\u8abf\u6574\uff1a\u30a2\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb", "\u81ea\u4f5cPCB\u3067\u4f5c\u308b\u9ad8\u54c1\u8cea\u306a\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc", "\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u9032\u5316\uff1aTL072\u3068LM386\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u8a2d\u8a08", "\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u8a2d\u8a08\u5165\u9580\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u3068\u306f\uff1f", "\u30d7\u30ed\u306e\u97f3\u8cea\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\uff01\u5b89\u4fa1\u306a\u90e8\u54c1\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"]}

China is addressing this with a megaproject that is a new spin on their most famous piece of infrastructure.\nAt 250 miles long with a generating capacity of 100 GW, the Great Solar Wall will be able to provide enough energy to power Beijing, although the energy will more likely be used to power industrial operations also present in the Kubuqi Desert. NASA states, The Kubuqi\u2019s sunny weather, flat terrain, and proximity to industrial centers make it a desirable location for solar power generation. As an added bonus, previous solar installations in China have shown that they can help combat further desertification by locking dunes in place and providing shade for plants to grow.\nEngineers must be having fun with the project as they also designed the Guinness World Record holder for the largest image made of solar panels with the Junma Solar Power Station (its the horse in the image above). The Great Solar Wall is expected to be completed by 2030 with 5.4 GW already installed in 2024.\nWant to try solar yourself on a slightly smaller scale? How about this solar thermal array inspired by the James Webb Telescope or building a solar-powered plane?", "title": "- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u300c\u5927\u592a\u967d\u306e\u58c1\u300d\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u9769\u547d", "body": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u306f\u592a\u967d\u5149\u767a\u96fb\u306e\u5de8\u5927\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300c\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u300d\u3092\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3002", "titles": ["- \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u300c\u5927\u592a\u967d\u306e\u58c1\u300d\u304c\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u9769\u547d", "- \u7802\u6f20\u306e\u529b\u3092\u501f\u308a\u305f\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u767a\u96fb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8", "- \u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u306e350\u30ad\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u53ca\u3076\u767a\u96fb\u80fd\u529b\u3068\u306f", "- \u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u6280\u8853\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7802\u6f20\u5316\u9632\u6b62\u306e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8a66\u307f", "- \u81ea\u5b85\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30bd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u6d3b\u7528\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u7d39\u4ecb"]}

You might think thats an arbitrary rule, but [FloatHeadPhysics] shows a different way to think about it. Based on a book hes been reading, Relativity Visualized, he provides a graphic argument for relativity that you can see in the video below.\nThe argument starts off by explaining how a three-dimensional object might appear in a two-dimensional world. In this world, everything is climbing in the hidden height dimension at the exact same speed.\n\nOur 2D friends, of course, can only see the shadow of the 3D object so if it is staying in one place on the table surface, the object never seems to move. However, just as we can measure time with a clock, the flat beings could devise a way to measure height. They would see that the object was moving through height at the fixed speed.\nNow suppose the object turns a bit and is moving at, say, a 45 degree angle relative to the table top. Now the shadow moves and the clock speed measuring the height starts moving more slowly. If the object moves totally parallel to the surface, the shadow moves at the fixed speed and the clock speed shadow doesnt move at all.\nThis neatly explains time dilation and length contraction. It also shows that the speed of light isnt necessarily a rule. It is simply that everything in the observable universe is moving at the speed of light and how moving through space affects it.\nDoesnt make sense? Watch the video and it will. Pretty heady stuff. We love how passionate [FloatHeadPhysics] gets about the topic. If you prefer a funnier approach, turn to the BBC. Or, if you like the hands-on approach, build a cloud chamber and measure some muons.\n", "title": "- 3\u6b21\u5143\u30682\u6b21\u5143\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b: \u76f8\u5bfe\u6027\u7406\u8ad6\u306e\u8996\u899a\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "body": "\u5149\u901f\u3067\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u306f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3060\u304c\u3001\u76f8\u5bfe\u6027\u7406\u8ad6\u3067\u5225\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u6b21\u5143\u306e\u9055\u3044\u304b\u3089\u6642\u9593\u306e\u9045\u308c\u3084\u9577\u3055\u53ce\u7e2e\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3002", "titles": ["- 3\u6b21\u5143\u30682\u6b21\u5143\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b: \u76f8\u5bfe\u6027\u7406\u8ad6\u306e\u8996\u899a\u7684\u7406\u89e3", "- \u5149\u901f\u306e\u5236\u9650\u3092\u518d\u8003: \u6d6e\u904a\u3059\u308b\u7269\u4f53\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089", "- \u6642\u9593\u306e\u9045\u308c\u3068\u9577\u3055\u306e\u53ce\u7e2e\u3092\u89e3\u8aac\u3059\u308b\u5b9f\u9a13", "- \u30d5\u30a3\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080: \u52d5\u304d\u3068\u5149\u306e\u901f\u5ea6\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066", "- \u5b9f\u8df5\u7684\u306a\u79d1\u5b66: \u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30aa\u30f3\u3092\u6e2c\u5b9a\u3057\u3088\u3046"]}
